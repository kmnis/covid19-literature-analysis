Many IBV serotypes have been isolated so far and some serotypes induce pathological changes in organs other than the respiratory tissues [ 1 ] . This variable tissue tropism is likely due to tissue-specifi c factors resulting in differences in binding or entry of the virus. Although a specifi c protein receptor for IBV is yet to be revealed it has been shown by removing sialic acids from the susceptible cell surface, that \u03b12, 3-linked sialic acids are a determinant of cell attachment and entry of IBV [ 2 , 3 ] . Further elucidation of hostvirus interactions is, however, hampered due to limitations in in vitro infection model systems for pathogenic IBV strains.For IBV the initial cell attachment and entry is mediated by a glycoprotein called spike protein residing in the viral envelope. By swapping the gene encoding for spike protein between different IBV serotypes it has been shown that the spike determines the tissue tropism [ 4 ] . The spike protein is cleaved into an S1 and an S2 subunit [ 5 , 6 ] ; while S1 mediates the fi rst step in infection via the initial virus-cell binding, S2 is responsible for cell entry [ 7 ] . Analyzing the binding of S1 to tissues with our protein histochemistry protocol enables us not only to profi le the attachment of avian coronavirus S1 proteins to various avian tissues but also to elucidate glycan binding specifi cities of IBV S1 [ 8 ] as well as determinants within S1 for tissue attachment [ 9 ] . Thereby, this method aids to understand the in vivo tissue tropism of avian coronaviruses."", ""Materials"": ""The amounts of buffers or chemicals prepared are described such to result in a convenient volume.

Transfection of HEK 293T cells with pCD5 expression vector has been described previously [ 10 , 11 ] .3. Dissolving of PEI in distilled water might take up to 1 or 2 days.

The effi ciency of PEI for transfecting HEK 293T cells with DNA is tested by using PEI ratios from 1:5 to 1:20. The number of transfected cells is counted using a fl uorescence microscope under 10\u00d7 magnifi cation. The best ratio to use for subsequent transfection is the ratio that gives the highest percentage (usually 40 %) of transfected cells with lowest toxicity or cell death."", ""5."": ""Concentration gradient ensures reaching the optimum amount of lectins required for complete blocking of the binding of recombinant proteins.6. By seeding 1 \u00d7 10 7 cells per T175 fl ask we were able to reach 50-60 % confl uence after 24 h post seeding. When compared to <50 % or >60 % cell confl uence, transfection at 50-60 % confl uence results in a signifi cantly higher transfection efficiency and thereby higher amounts of recombinant proteins.7. Proteins in the supernatant (using 5-10 \u00b5l) are analyzed using SDS PAGE followed by western blotting to determine whether the protein is properly produced. In particular we check for any degradation, low or no expression and correct molecular weight (IBV S1 protein is highly glycosylated and migrates around 110 kDa). Upon high amounts of protein in the culture supernatant (usually appearing as thick bands of \u22655 mm in the fi lm) we add 250 \u00b5l of 50 % Strep-Tactin sepharose suspension for each 10 ml of supernatant. However, compared to column-based purifi cation minor fraction of proteins were lost with the supernatant after purifi cation with the beads. If necessary, column based purifi cation can be done according to the manufacturer's instructions.8. Since the beads tend to stick on to the surface of the tube, it is important not to disturb the sediment after centrifugation and while transferring to a 2 ml Eppendorf tube. If necessary, to recover more beads from the surface of the tube add PBS for another one or two times, but limit the total volume to no more than 1.8 ml to prevent spilling of the beads while closing the Eppendorf tube.9. For every 250 \u00b5l of 50 % Strep-Tactin sepharose suspension we use 125 \u00b5l of elution buffer. Whenever we obtained low protein yields (<4 mg/ml) the proteins were concentrated using Vivaspin according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 . We use \u22652 \u00b5l of purifi ed proteins to measure the concentrations in Qubit fl uorimeter. We also approximated the protein concentrations compared to a BSA standard after GelCode Blue/Coomassie staining of a SDS PAGE gel.11. Performing antigen retrieval in the microwave can destroy some tissues (for example tracheal epithelium and cartilage). In such instances transfer the glass slides into a polypropylene Coplin jar fi lled with citrate buffer, cover with a lid, and keep in a water bath preheated to 80 \u00b0C for 45 min.12. Since Strep -Tactin HRP is optimized only for western blotting different lots may complex to a different extent with spike proteins. Therefore, every lot number has to be tested using a prior lot number giving positive signals. Moreover, the amount of Strep -Tactin HRP to the total volume (1:200) was opti-mized for IBV-S1, and has to be optimized accordingly when using a recombinant protein with different molecular weight.13. Wear gloves when handling AEC. Apply AEC in a fume hood and discard safely the water drained with AEC. For large tissue sections a coverslip can be used to spread AEC drops gently over the tissues, thus minimizing the required amounts of AEC to suffi ciently cover tissues.14. We used both Vibrio cholera neuraminidase and Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase. Compared to Vibrio cholera neuraminidase, Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase showed more effi cient cleaving of sialic acids from tissues embedded in paraffi n. It is important to apply suffi cient volume of total fl uid to prevent drying off the tissues during incubation at 37 \u00b0C.""}",Protein Histochemistry Using Coronaviral Spike Proteins: Studying Binding Profiles and Sialic Acid Requirements for Attachment to Tissues,"Protein histochemistry is a tissue-based technique that enables the analysis of viral attachment patterns as well as the identification of specific viral and host determinants involved in the first step in the infection of a host cell by a virus. Applying recombinantly expressed spike proteins of infectious bronchitis virus onto formalin-fixed tissues allows us to profile the binding characteristics of these viral attachment proteins to tissues of various avian species. In particular, sialic acid-mediated tissue binding of spike proteins can be analyzed by pretreating tissues with various neuraminidases or by blocking the binding of the viral proteins with specific lectins.

Primary infection takes place in the majority of cases early in the life and is followed by a lifelong latent infection, from which reactivation may occur with viral shedding at least in the saliva. The outcome of reactivation strongly depends from the host immunological status. In immunodepressed patients, all these three viruses may cause severe diseases, which may be different depending on the virus and on other factors, including host defences. Mostly, hCMV and also HSV1 may cause severe respiratory diseases, whereas the role of EBV in pneumonia is debated [1] . In addition to a direct involvement of these viruses in respiratory diseases, their detection has been associated with other clinical aspects, which may promote viral reactivation or which outcome may be influenced by viral reactivation.An increasing number of papers report the presence of HSV1, hCMV and EBV in respiratory samples of critically ill patients even without canonical immunosuppression [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . In patients requiring mechanical ventilation, herpesviruses, mainly HSV1 and hCMV, may be frequently detected from either upper or lower respiratory tract Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is today a leading cause of hospitalization in intensive care unit (ICU). ARDS and pneumonia are closely related to critically ill patients; however, the etiologic agent is not always identified. The presence of human herpes simplex virus 1, human cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus in respiratory samples of critically ill patients is increasingly reported even without canonical immunosuppression. The main aim of this study was to better understand the significance of herpesviruses finding in lower respiratory tract of ARDS patients hospitalized in ICU. The presence of this group of herpesviruses, in addition to the research of influenza viruses and other common respiratory viruses, was investigated in respiratory samples from 54 patients hospitalized in ICU, without a known microbiological causative agent. Moreover, the immunophenotype of each patient was analyzed. Herpesviruses DNA presence in the lower respiratory tract seemed not attributable to an impaired immunophenotype, whereas a significant correlation was observed between herpesviruses positivity and influenza virus infection. A higher ICU mortality was significantly related to the presence of herpesvirus infection in the lower respiratory tract as well as to impaired immunophenotype, as patients with poor outcome showed severe lymphopenia, affecting in particular T (CD3+) cells, since the first days of ICU hospitalization. In conclusion, these results indicate that herpesviruses lower respiratory tract infection, which occurs samples [6, 7] . It has been suggested that the presence of HSV1 in the respiratory samples of ICU patients correlates with the duration of tracheal intubation [5] . The detection of HSV1 in the lower respiratory tract of ICU patients is reported with a variable frequency, from 5 to 64 % depending on the population and the diagnostic method used [2, 8, 9] . Moreover, it is not always clear whether the demonstration of HSV1 DNA in lower respiratory tract samples of non-immunocompromised ventilated patients is the consequence of a contamination from mouth or throat or is the result of local viral reactivation [4, 6, 7, 10] . Some studies showed that there was a significant association between an HSV1 viral load >100.000 copies/ml of BAL and admission to the ICU (p < 0.0001), mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001) and death (p < 0.01) [5, 11, 12] .Active hCMV infection, either restricted to the lower respiratory tract or involving both the lower respiratory airways and the systemic compartment, has been shown to occur frequently during critical illness in adult hCMV-seropositive patients [13] , and has been associated with prolonged ICU hospitalization, extended periods of mechanical ventilation, higher rates of nosocomial infection and overall mortality [11, [14] [15] [16] [17] .The role of EBV presence in respiratory tract of ICU patients is not clear. High degree of variability concerning the prevalence of EBV in BAL samples from patients admitted in ICU is reported in the literature [1, [18] [19] [20] [21] .ARDS is today a leading cause of hospitalization in ICU. ARDS and pneumonia are closely related to critically ill patients [22] ; however, it is not always identified the etiologic agent. In most cases, bacterial infections are the main causative agent of pulmonary infections that evolve into framework of ARDS; more recently, viral infections, mainly related to influenza viruses, represent a new category of emerging cause of ARDS, and also viruses belonging to other families, in association or not to bacterial infections, may be involved. In still other cases, the causative agent remains unrecognized [23] . Furthermore, the critically ill patients develop a state of immunosuppression, which can promote the onset and exacerbation of viral infections [24] .The aim of this study was to better understand the significance of herpesviruses finding in lower respiratory tract of patients hospitalized in ICU and to assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of these findings. Patients' characteristics, with attention to their immunological setting, were analyzed together with the virological data."", ""Materials and methods"": ""Institutional Internal Committee approval was waived for this study as it involved retrospective analysis of anonymous, routinely collected, group data. During the period September 2011-May 2014, 164 patients with diagnosis of ARDS were admitted to ICU (Intensive Care Unit of Emergency Department-Careggi Teaching Hospital, Florence-Italy), from different clinical setting. For 54 out of these 164 patients, the causative agent of ARDS was unknown. The following samples were collected for microbiological analysis:\u2022 Throat swab (TS) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sent to general laboratory for research of common germs; \u2022 TS and BAL sent to virology laboratory for the detection of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses like adenovirus (Adv), parainfluenza viruses 1-4 (PIV 1-4), enterovirus/rhinovirus (EV/RhV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human coronaviruses (hCoV) group I and group II, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and herpetic viruses.For each patient, the following data were collected:\u2022 anamnestic data: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) adjusted for age; \u2022 data and severity scores at ICU admission: SAPS II at admission, SOFA at admission, GCS at admission, provenience, length of stay before ICU admission; \u2022 data related to respiratory samples: sampling timing, positivity for influenza viruses RNA as well as for other respiratory viruses genome sequences, HSV1/hCMV/ EBV DNA; HSV1/hCMV/EBV viral load in BAL; \u2022 immunophenotyping analysis at ICU admission;\u2022 data related to ICU stay: treatment with antiviral, steroid; need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support and duration of treatment with ECMO; \u2022 outcome data: SAPS II at discharge, GCS at discharge, ventilation length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, ICU mortality, post-ICU LOS, post-ICU mortality."", ""Clinical sampling and analytical phase"": ""In the study period, 108 samples were analyzed with the aim to look for the presence of herpesviruses in 54 patients. All clinical samples were collected using standard techniques [25] . The throat swab was obtained with a nylon fiber tip (Copan Eswab\u2122 System) inserted and rotated into the throat of patient. The BAL samples were taken with sterile flexible bronchoscope through the oro-tracheal tube or the tracheal cannula; after the assessment of the tracheal-bronchial tree, 30 ml of sterile saline solution was instilled and picked up in a specimen trap (Covidien Argyle\u2122).The detection and typing of influenza viruses were achieved as already described, using primers and probe sequence as indicated by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [26] . For the detection of other respiratory viruses, duplex real-time PCR, already described, was used [27] .The detection of HSV1 DNA, hCMV DNA and EBV DNA was performed by in-house assays. The in-house assays here described were already used in the laboratory of virology and had shown a performance comparable with commercial assays, at a lower cost. Any way the results here reported were confirmed by comparison with commercial, validated assays (Realtime Q-PCR kit, ELITech Molecular Diagnostics)."", ""Viral DNA extraction and real-time PCRs"": ""Extraction of viral DNAs from clinical samples was carried out using a commercially available kit (HP PCR Template Preparation Kit, Roche Diagnostics, Milan, Italy).To detect hCMV, HSV1 and EBV DNA in TS and BAL samples, three real-time PCRs were developed, using primers listed in Table 1 . The real-time PCRs were performed using 2 X HRM PCR master mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The reaction volume for each amplification was 25 \u03bcl (12.5 \u03bcl of master mix, 1.75 \u03bcl of each primer [10 \u03bcM], 5 \u03bcl of DNA and H 2 O to reach the final volume). After initial activation step, 40 cycles of amplification [95 \u00b0C for 10 s, 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, 72 \u00b0C for 10 s (acquiring Green)] were performed. For melting analysis, ramp from 78 to 92 \u00b0C was used, rising by 0.1 \u00b0C each step. The reaction was performed on Rotor Gene 6000 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).All herpesvirus-positive BAL samples were quantified by quantitative real-time PCRs.To perform the calibration curves, serial dilutions of DNA calibrator for each virus were used. These calibrators consisted of DNA sequences obtained by the cloning the product of the PCR of viral DNA of each virus in the pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). The plasmid DNA was purified by QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).The analytical sensitivity of all PCRs was determined using serial dilutions of cloned calibrators, quantified by NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The real-time PCR for EBV was able to detect 300 copies number/ml. The sensitivity of real-time PCR for hCMV and HSV1 was 100 copies number/ml.As the volumes and other characteristics of BAL samples can vary, each BAL sample was quantitatively analyzed also for the \u03b2-globin gene, as described below.

This group represents 33.9 % of all patients admitted in ICU with diagnosis of ARDS, without a known microbiological causative agent; within 48 h after ICU admission, clinical samples from these patients were sent to the laboratory for the detection both bacterial and viral infections and for immunophenotyping analysis to assess the immunological status of patients.The descriptive analysis of the entire sample of patients is illustrated in Table 2 .In 48.1 % of cases, patients required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for severe ARDS, with hypoxia and/or hypercapnia unresponsive to conventional treatment. The ECMO LOS was on average 15.83 \u00b1 13.13 days.One hundred and eight clinical samples from upper and lower respiratory tract from the 54 ICU patients were analyzed to detect influenza and other respiratory viruses and a group of herpesviruses (EBV, hCMV and HSV1). A total of 35 patients (65 %) were positive for one or more herpesviruses in at least one respiratory sample (18 TF only, 7 BAL only, 10 both samples). Thus, altogether, herpesviruses were present in BAL from 17 patients (31 %) and in TS from 28 patients (52 %). EBV was detected in 23 out of 54 patients (43 %), either as a single infection or as mixed infection. In only 5 patients (9 %), EBV DNA was demonstrated in BAL samples. In 3 cases, it was present as a single infection and in the two other as a mixed infection. hCMV was detected in 15 patients (28 %), either as single (in 2 patients) or mixed infection (in 13 patients). In seven patients (13 %), hCMV DNA was demonstrated in BAL samples. As regards HSV1, viral DNA was detected in 15 patients (28 %). In 9 of these (17 %), it was present in BAL.In addition, as BAL represents a sample more suggestive of lower respiratory tract infection and/or of more invasive infection/reactivation, to understand better the significance of herpesviruses presence in this site, herpesviruses DNA load in BAL samples was assessed by quantitative realtime PCRs. EBV DNA viral load in BAL samples varied between traces (not quantifiable) in one sample to 1 \u00d7 10 9 copies number/ml in another sample with a median value of 10 3 copies/ml. Altogether, EBV DNA load (mean \u00b1 SD) was 21,254 \u00b1 44,023. The range of hCMV DNA load varied between traces (not quantifiable) in one sample to 1 \u00d7 10 5 copies number/ml with a median value of 10 3 copies/ml also in this case. Altogether, hCMV DNA load (mean \u00b1 SD) was 4240 \u00b1 2619. The load of HSV1 in BAL samples varied between 10 copies number/ml in one sample only and 10 9 copies number/ml with a median value of 10 7 . Altogether, HSV1 DNA load (mean \u00b1 SD) was 142,629,452 \u00b1 422,767,741. According to herpetic viral infection positivity, patients were divided into 4 groups: group of hCMV-positive patients (n = 7); group of EBV-positive patients (n = 5); group of HSV1-positive patients (n = 9); and group of herpesvirus-negative patients (n = 37).Patients positive for more than 1 herpesvirus have been included in more than one group.The analysis of the 4 groups is shown in Table 3 . There were no statistically significant differences in the medical history data, the severity score values at ICU admission and the provenience data. No statistically significant difference in corticosteroid treatment and in the need for extracorporeal treatment was observed. Outcome data showed no statistically significant differences, except for a higher mortality in ICU in patients with herpetic viral infection (hCMV group: 71.4 %, HSV1 group: 55.5 %, EBV group: 40.0 %, herpesvirus-negative group: 21.6 %; p < 0.05).A significant correlation emerged between influenza virus infection and herpetic viruses coinfection (p < 0.05). All patients with influenza positivity were treated with oseltamivir. In patients with persistent influenza infection, zanamivir was added.Dividing patients into two groups, based on the positivity for influenza virus, no correlation emerged between influenza infection and ICU mortality. The statistically significant data observed are reported in Table 4 : patients with influenza infection showed higher incidence of herpesviruses coinfection in comparison with patients without influenza (52.6 vs 20.0 %; p = 0.01); SAPS II demission score was 11 \u00b1 6.78 for influenza-positive patients, whereas it was 27 \u00b1 11.75 for patients without influenza. In addition, the CD3+ percentage was 68.23 \u00b1 7.24 for influenzapositive patients and 60.37 \u00b1 16.28 for influenza-negative patients. This observation is in agreement with the presence of lymphocytosis as a risk factor for ICU admission in laboratory confirmed influenza patients [33] .An additional analysis was performed by dividing patients into two groups on the basis of ICU mortality: the group of survivors included 37 patients discharged from the ICU; the group of non-survivors included 17 patients died in ICU.The statistically significant data are shown in Table 5 . ICU mortality was significantly associated with herpesviruses infection in the lower respiratory tract. In fact, 53 % of herpesviruses infected patients died in ICU Only few patients with laboratory confirmed herpesviruses infection were treated with acyclovir/ganciclovir and despite the treatment they died; however, the small number of observations and the lack of virological monitoring does not allow us to tray any conclusion. Several immunological parameters were significantly impaired in the group of patients ICU died. In particular, a clear reduction in circulating lymphocytes was evident in this group when compared to the group of patients discharged from ICU. The cell reduction involves all lymphocytes populations: T (CD3+), B (CD19+) and NK cells (CD3CD16/56+). These data can account for both extravasation of cells that are recruited in inflamed organs and for cell apoptosis that typically affects hyper-activated lymphocytes. To evaluate the influence on ICU mortality of viral coinfections, patients were divided into 4 groups depending on the presence of influenza and/or herpetic infection. ANOVA analysis showed no statistically significant difference in ICU mortality. In the group (n = 10) with presence of both infections (herpes and influenza), ICU mortality was 40 %; in patients with only influenza positivity (n = 9), ICU mortality was 22.3 %, while in patients with only herpetic positivity (n = 7), it was 71.4 %; ICU mortality was 21.5 % in patients with no one viral positivity (n = 28) (p = 0.30). Even if these differences are not significant, these data add further evidence to the association of ICU mortality with herpesviruses infection, whereas ICU mortality in patients with only influenza infection is similar to that of patients negative for both viruses.To better investigate the variables most associated with mortality, we built a logistic model with SAPS II, herpesviruses positivity and total CD3 value. Candidate variables were chosen as those statistically significant and/or clinically relevant to the outcome. Table 6 shows that the only variable significantly associated with mortality is herpetic infection; this indicates that herpesviruses positivity is an independent predictor of death. Moreover, we researched a cutoff value for SAPS II and CD3+ (Table 7 ; Figs. 1, 2). The logistic regression is slightly over-fitted, but the Hosmer-Lemenshow test is not significant (p = 0.149), suggesting a good calibration of the model."", ""Discussion and conclusions"": ""ARDS is a relevant disease today, affecting patients of all ages that may require admission to intensive care unit. The mortality for this pathology is still high, despite the implementation of specific therapies in recent years. In patients with ARDS, bacterial infections are prevalent; however, there are no enough studies that highlight the presence of viral etiology. Among respiratory viruses, influenza A viruses, above all of the subtype (H1N1)pdm09, may be associated with ARDS, as it became evident during and after the last influenza pandemic. Some studies report the frequent presence of herpesviruses in respiratory samples of patients with ARDS [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] 34] . However, the significance of this positivity is still debated.This report concerns a group of 54 patients admitted to ICU because of ARDS with unknown causative agent; 19 of them were infected by influenza virus, as demonstrated by the detection of viral RNA in both upper and lower respiratory tract samples. Instead, two other patients, influenza negative, were positive in the BAL for RhV and AdV, respectively. This study confirms that influenza viruses, mainly the H1N1 pandemic subtype, are frequently related to ARDS requiring ICU hospitalization, whereas other common respiratory viruses showed to be involved only sporadically. In 10 of 19 influenza-positive patients, also the DNA of one or more herpesvirus was present in the BAL, whereas no coinfection with herpesviruses was found in the patients with RhV or AdV infection. Thus, in BAL of 7 patients, DNA of herpesviruses alone was found. These data indicate that in 28/54 patients viral infections seem to be involved in ARDS. However, the number of respiratory virus-positive patients could be underestimated because of the time elapsed between the onset of symptoms and the ICU hospitalization. In addition, this study concerned the common respiratory viruses, whereas others like bocavirus and mimivirus were not included. Moreover, it is possible that other already unknown viruses exist. Data on other causative agents as bacteria or fungi have not been considered in this study. In addition to the detection of a direct viral cause of ARDS, this study highlights the existence of some interaction among different viruses and also among viruses, immune status and outcome of ARDS. In fact, a significant correlation was observed between influenza infection and herpesviruses reactivation, demonstrated by the detection of the viral DNA in the BAL. This observation could suggest that the respiratory mucosa damage caused by influenza virus replication can trigger herpesviruses reactivation. As regards each herpesvirus searched in the respiratory tract of the patients included in this study, EBV was the more frequently detected (43 %), whereas both hCMV and HSV1 were present in the respiratory tract of 28 % of patients. However, in BAL EBV DNA was found in 5 patients only (9 %), and hCMV DNA and HSV1 DNA were found in 7 (13 %) and 9 (17 %) patients, respectively. The frequency and DNA load of HSV1 in BAL samples were higher than that of hCMV and EBV, and in 6 patients, it was higher than 100,000 copies/ml, a value that is reported in the literature [5] as related to higher mortality. These results are in agreement with those of Tachikawa [35] who reported that reactivation of HSV1 was predominantly observed in intubated patients regardless of their immune status, whereas reactivation of hCMV and EBV was rare in immunocompetent patients. Herpesviruses reactivation, as could be inferred by the detection of viral DNA in BAL, was not significantly associated with impaired immunophenotype, whereas it showed to be related to ICU mortality. In particular, the highest ICU mortality was observed among patients with hCMV reactivation, followed by those with HSV1 reactivation and then by those with EBV reaction. As regards the role of each herpesvirus here considered, the small number of data for each virus does not allow to draw a definitive conclusion. Altogether, it seems that EBV may be involved in ARDS like the two other herpesviruses, with a slightly lower frequency. Furthermore, the data analyzed in this study indicate that ICU mortality was significantly related to an impaired immunophenotype as patients with poor outcome showed severe lymphopenia, affecting in particular T (CD3+) cells, since the first days of ICU hospitalization.In the present study, for the first time, as far as we know, several factors, like respiratory viral infections, respiratory infection/reactivation by some herpesviruses and immune status of the patients, have been considered and analyzed together. The results obtained, even if on a small number of patients, suggest that in a situation such complex as ARDS and in its outcome these factors may act at same time and synergistically: among these, viral respiratory infection, mainly by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, herpesviruses reactivation (more frequently HSV1, hCMV and also EBV), which may be triggered by the influenza infection, and immune factors (as impaired immunophenotype).This study has several limitations which are in part related to its observational nature and the scanty samples number. It emphasizes the importance of BAL analysis, whereas the analysis of viremia was performed only in few patients so that we were not able to afford a systematic analysis of these data, which must be implemented in future studies. In addition, it lacks dynamic data on herpesviruses infection, like resolution or persistence of viral infections. In addition, the usefulness of acyclovir/ganciclovir administration needs to be better studied.The data obtained imply that in ARDS ICU patientsinfluenza virus laboratory diagnosis should be performed more frequently and as soon as possible; herpesviruses lower respiratory tract infection should monitored, together with the immunological evaluation. This could allow for a timely anti-influenza treatment which could decrease the influenza virus damage on the respiratory mucosa and eventually decrease the probability of herpesviruses reactivation. Data deriving from the study of the immunological setting suggest that the evaluation of the immunophenotype is essential in order to improve the risk stratification in patients affected by systemic virus infection.""}",Human herpesviruses respiratory infections in patients with acute respiratory distress (ARDS),"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is today a leading cause of hospitalization in intensive care unit (ICU). ARDS and pneumonia are closely related to critically ill patients; however, the etiologic agent is not always identified. The presence of human herpes simplex virus 1, human cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus in respiratory samples of critically ill patients is increasingly reported even without canonical immunosuppression. The main aim of this study was to better understand the significance of herpesviruses finding in lower respiratory tract of ARDS patients hospitalized in ICU. The presence of this group of herpesviruses, in addition to the research of influenza viruses and other common respiratory viruses, was investigated in respiratory samples from 54 patients hospitalized in ICU, without a known microbiological causative agent. Moreover, the immunophenotype of each patient was analyzed. Herpesviruses DNA presence in the lower respiratory tract seemed not attributable to an impaired immunophenotype, whereas a significant correlation was observed between herpesviruses positivity and influenza virus infection. A higher ICU mortality was significantly related to the presence of herpesvirus infection in the lower respiratory tract as well as to impaired immunophenotype, as patients with poor outcome showed severe lymphopenia, affecting in particular T (CD3+) cells, since the first days of ICU hospitalization. In conclusion, these results indicate that herpesviruses lower respiratory tract infection, which occurs more frequently following influenza virus infection, can be a negative prognostic marker. An independent risk factor for ICU patients with ARDS is an impaired immunophenotype.",10.1007/s00430-016-0456-z,Medline; PMC,PMC7086591,27138606.0,no-cc,2016-05-02,Med Microbiol Immunol,,,,2707991.0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27138606/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00430-016-0456-z,2016.0,paper

PRRSV is one of the most important viruses hindering the development of the swine industry globally, especially with the emergence of highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) [5, 38] . Recently, new PRRSV mutant strains have become pandemic in China [1, 16, 17, 35, 37, 39] and are named NADC30-like PRRSV strains for their genomic similarity to the NADC30 strain isolated in the US in 2008 [3] . NADC30-like PRRSV strains feature different recombinations and have produced many mosaic isolates, enhancing their genetic diversity. Currently, the most effective methods to control viral diseases are vaccines and antiviral agents. However, vaccination against PRRSV infection has achieved limited success, primarily due to the high genetic diversity of the virus [9, 10, 22, 29] . In addition to genetic mutation, PRRSV genetic diversity is also generated by recombination among different strains, including vaccine strains [7, 18, 23, 30, 33, 37] . Importantly, commercial vaccines cannot provide complete protection against heterologous PRRSV infection [1, 21] . The problems outlined above indicate that the use of vaccines may not be an ideal strategy for PRRSV control; however, exploring effective anti-PRRSV drugs may overcome these issues.Isobavachalcone (IBC) is a prenylated chalcone of the flavonoid subclass that was first isolated from Psoralea corylifolia in 1968 [14] . IBC possesses a wide spectrum of biological activities, including antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, anti-reverse-transcriptase, antitubercular and antioxidant functions [14] . However, whether IBC has potential antiviral activity remains unclear. In the current study, for the first time, we observed that IBC has anti-PRRSV activity. Furthermore, after a systematic investigation, we demonstrated that IBC inhibits PRRSV replication at the post-entry stage of PRRSV infection. "", ""Cell, viruses and inhibitors"": ""Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were obtained from the lungs of 4-week-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) piglets, and monkey kidney cells (Marc145) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The highly pathogenic PRRSV strain HuN4 [25, 26] and the NADC30-like PRRSV strain HeN-L1 (isolated in our lab) were propagated and titrated in Marc145 cells. IBC was purchased from Shanghai Tauto Biotech Company and was dissolved in ethanol and used at the concentrations indicated."", ""Determination of isobavachalcone cytotoxicity"": ""The cytotoxicity of IBC was evaluated for PAMs and Marc145 cells. Briefly, twofold dilutions of IBC from a starting concentration of 25.6 \u03bcM were applied to 80% confluent cells in a 96-well plate. After incubation for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C, the cytotoxicity of IBC was evaluated using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8, Dojindo Laboratories, Japan) according to manufacturer's protocol. The CC 50 was defined as the concentration of IBC that reduced the absorbance of treated cells by 50% relative to that of the cell control."", ""Antiviral activity of IBC against PRRSV infection"": ""A total of 3 \u00d7 10 6 Marc145 cells were plated in a 6-well plate, and 18 h later, the cells were infected with HuN4 (multiplicity of infection [MOI] = 1) for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. Next, the culture medium was replaced with different concentrations of IBC diluted in DMEM containing 2% FBS. Cells were harvested at the indicated times for further Western blot or immunofluorescence analysis."", ""RNA extraction and absolute quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis"": ""The total RNA of all samples was extracted using an RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany), and 1 \u03bcg of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA according to the manufacturer's protocol (PrimeScript\u2122 RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser, TaKaRa). The real-time PCR procedure was performed using an Agilent Mx3005P Real-Time PCR System. The primers and probes were described in a previous report [28] ."", ""Immunofluorescence"": ""Cells were infected with HuN4 for 2 h and were then treated with various concentrations of IBC. After incubating for the indicated time, cells were fixed in 95% ethanol, permeabilized with 0.5% saponin in PBS, and then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature (RT). After blocking, the cells were incubated with a mouse anti-PRRSV N protein monoclonal antibody (IgG2b, made in our lab) at a dilution of 1:500 for 1 h at RT, and dsRNA was stained with the mouse monoclonal antibody J2 (Scicons, Hungary) at a dilution of 1:200 for 1 h at RT. After washing, an aliquot of 1:100-diluted FITC-labeled antimouse IgG (Sigma) was used as the secondary antibody. For nuclear visualization, cells were treated with DAPI (Sigma). Immunofluorescence was observed using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope."", ""Western blotting analysis"": ""Cells were washed twice with PBS and then prepared with RIPA lysis buffer (Solarbio). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay. Next, proteins from each sample were separated via 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), after which the protein bands were transferred onto a polypropylene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 2 h at RT and then incubated with mouse anti-PRRSV N protein monoclonal antibody (1:3000, made in our laboratory) or anti-\u03b2-actin antibody (1:4000, Sigma) for 1.5 h at RT. After being washed three times with PBST (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS), the membrane was incubated for 1 h with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma). Protein bands were visualized with ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Thermo Scientific). Western blot bands were quantified and analyzed using ImageJ. The relative intensity ratio of protein bands (N protein/\u03b2-actin) was calculated as an indicator of PRRSV replication ability, with the value of the control group set as 1; other IBC treated groups were normalized correspondingly."", ""Determination of the IC 50 of IBC against PRRSV infection"": ""To further investigate the anti-PRRSV activity of IBC, the drug concentration that could inhibit PRRSV infections by approximately 50% (50% inhibitory concentration, IC 50 ) was determined. Marc145 cells were infected with PRRSV (MOI = 1) for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C and then treated with twofold dilutions of IBC. Total RNA was isolated from cells at 24 h postinfection (p.i.), and intracellular PRRSV RNA copy numbers were determined by RT-PCR. The percentage inhibition was calculated as [(RNA copies in control cells -(RNA copies in cells treated with IBC)] \u00f7 (RNA copies of the control) \u00d7 100 at the indicated IBC concentration, and the value for the control group was set as 1. The other IBC-treated groups were normalized correspondingly."", ""Attachment and entry assay"": ""A virus attachment and entry assay was performed by preincubating Marc145 cells at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min, after which PRRSV HuN4 (MOI = 1) and 5 \u03bcM IBC were added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 \u00b0C to allow attachment of the virus to the cells. Next, the cells were washed three times with cold PBS to remove unbound virus. The cells were then collected and either used to detect PRRSV RNA levels via real-time PCR (to assess viral attachment) or provided fresh medium containing 5 \u03bcM IBC and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. A temperature shift from 4 to 37 \u00b0C was performed to promote entry of the virus into the cells, and after a 2-h incubation, total RNA was collected and analyzed by real-time PCR (to assess viral entry)."", ""Time-of-addition assay with isobavachalcone"": ""Marc145 cells were infected with PRRSV HuN4 (MOI = 1) at 37 \u00b0C.

For the postinfection inhibition study, HuN4-infected cells were replenished with 2% FBS supplemented with 5 or 10 \u03bcM IBC at specific time points (2, 6, 12, or 24 h). Cells were harvested at 24 h after IBC treatment, and the levels of PRRSV replication were estimated by Western blot analysis."", ""Statistical analysis"": ""Origin 8.0 software was used for all graphical representations. The IC 50 was calculated using non-linear regression. Statistical significance was established using an independent t-test, and P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant."", ""Isobavachalcone inhibits PRRSV replication in vitro"": ""The structure of IBC is shown in Figure 1A . To assess the anti-PRRSV activity of IBC, we first evaluated the cytotoxicity of IBC on Marc145 cells (Fig. 1B) and PAM cells (Fig. 1C) , and the results indicated that cell viability was not significantly affected by IBC at concentrations up to 25.6 \u03bcM and that the CC 50 of IBC for Marc145 cells was 63.09 \u03bcM (data not show). The cytotoxic effect of the IBC solvent (alcohol) was also evaluated, the results of which indicated that the alcohol had no effect on Marc145 cells (Fig. 1B) andPAM cells (Fig. 1C) . Next, we evaluated the anti-PRRSV capabilities of IBC in Marc145 cells that were infected with PRRSV HuN4 (MOI = 1) and then treated with different concentrations of IBC. We first determined progeny virus titers and found that IBC significantly inhibited PRRSV replication in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D ). To confirm this finding, we also performed an indirect immunofluorescence assay by staining cells with a PRRSV N protein antibody and then observed PRRSV replication by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Figure 1E , PRRSV replication was significantly blocked by IBC. Western blot analysis revealed that PRRSV N protein levels decreased markedly, indicating that increasing concentrations of IBC significantly inhibited PRRSV replication (Fig. 1F) . To determine whether this inhibition was strain specific, we additionally assayed a currently pandemic NADC30-like strain (HeN-L1) that was isolated in our lab and observed it also to be inhibited by IBC (Fig. 1G) . Thus, these data indicate that IBC inhibition of PRRSV is not strain specific. Furthermore, the antiviral activity of IBC against PRRSV HuN4 was both dose dependent and successful, with an IC 50 of 3.12 \u03bcM (Fig. 2 ) and a selectivity index (SI; the ratio of the CC 50 to the IC 50 ) of 22.02."", ""IBC inhibits PRRSV at an early stage"": ""Despite the evidence that IBC inhibits PRRSV replication, the viral stage influenced by IBC remained unknown. To determine which step(s) in the viral life cycle are affected by IBC, we first performed time-of-drug-addition assays.The results indicated that IBC markedly inhibited PRRSV when added early after infection and remained inhibitory when added up to 6 h p.i., whereas PRRSV inhibition was limited when IBC was added late, at 12 h p.i. (Fig. 3) . These data suggest that IBC targets the early phase of the viral life cycle, as it was not able to prevent viral infection after the virus entered the post-replicative stages of infection."", ""IBC does not influence PRRSV attachment and entry"": ""Next, we tested whether IBC inhibited PRRSV by disturbing PRRSV attachment or entry. The results demonstrated that PRRSV attachment was not influenced by IBC (Fig. 4A) . Interestingly, the PRRSV entry assay results were the same as those of the attachment assay, demonstrating that neither PRRSV attachment nor entry was influenced by IBC (Fig. 4B )."", ""Viral RNA synthesis is considerably disrupted by isobavachalcone"": ""The addition of IBC was inhibitory from 2 to 6 h p.i., whereas it had no effect on PRRSV attachment or entry ( Fig. 4A and B) . This inhibition at post-entry stages led us to speculate that IBC inhibits PRRSV replication at the stage of viral RNA synthesis. To test whether IBC blocked viral RNA replication, we performed inhibition experiments using PAM cells and stained for dsRNAs, which are intermediates in viral replication, with the J2 antibody, which recognizes dsRNA. The results indicated that dsRNA levels were significantly decreased in IBCtreated cells (Fig. 5A and B) . These data clearly suggest "", ""Discussion"": ""Currently, PRRSV is a significant problem for the swine industry in China and was a veritable Pandora's Box for the Chinese pig industry during the first outbreak [17] . The current pandemic strains are highly diverse, and commercial vaccines can provide only partial protection against these strains [27, 40] . Thus, anti-PRRSV drugs may be more suitable for PRRSV control in the future. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely used as a source of novel drugs, and many crude TCM herbal extracts have been shown to inhibit PRRSV replication [6, 24, 36] . IBC is extracted from P. corylifolia, which itself is used in TCM [14] . Cheng et al. systematically analyzed seventeen compounds derived from TCMs and tested their PRRSV antiviral activity in vitro [4] . Two compounds, chlorogenic acid and scutellarin, were shown to have great anti-PRRSV replication potential in their study, and the inhibition ratios of chlorogenic acid and scutellarin can reach 90.8 and 61.1%, respectively, at the maximum noncytotoxic concentrations [4] ; in contrast, the IBC inhibition ratio exceeded 90% at 15 \u03bcM, an improvement over the maximum non-cytotoxic concentrations for the other tested compounds. This result indicated that IBC is more effective than chlorogenic acid and scutellarin. IBC has multiple biological activities; it potently abrogates Akt and Erk signaling pathways and exerts anti-proliferative effects on several human cancer cell lines, and it also induces apoptosis associated with the mitochondrial pathway [11, 12, 14] . Akt has been reported to play a positive role in PRRSV randomly selected for statistical analysis. The mean rates of positive cells among the total cells in each group were calculated using ImageJ gene expression and entry, and PRRSV replication may be dependent on the activation of PI3K/Akt [19, 31, 32, 34] . The ERK signaling pathway has been demonstrated to play an important role in the post-entry steps of the PRRSV replication cycle and to enhance PRRSV infection [15] . The ERK pathway may also contribute to HP-PRRSV pathogenesis [2] . Apoptosis also influences PRRSV replication, since the induction of apoptosis in Marc145 cells increases virus replication [8] . IBC inhibition of PRRSV replication may occur through modulation of the above-mentioned pathway. IBC may be applicable as an efficacious and safe drug for the treatment of some cancers, such as neuroblastoma [20] . IBC has been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV papain-like protease; however, whether IBC inhibits infectious virus was not tested in that study [13] . This study is the first to report that IBC has potent antiviral activity, and we demonstrate here that it blocks PRRSV replication at the initiation of viral RNA replication in vitro. However, there are some unanswered questions that should be further explored in the future. First, whether IBC also shows anti-PRRSV activity in vivo must be investigated. Second, is the blockage of viral RNA formation a direct or indirect effect? Third, are there other viruses that are also inhibited by IBC?In conclusion, we evaluated whether IBC has antiviral potential as a PRRSV infection treatment. The in vitro study established that IBC efficiently inhibited the replication of both HP-PRRSV and the current Chinese epidemic NADC30-like strains without significant drug toxicity. Thus, IBC may be a candidate for further evaluation as a therapeutic agent against PRRSV infection of swine in vivo.""}",Isobavachalcone inhibits post-entry stages of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus life cycle,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a pathogen of great economic significance that impacts the swine industry globally. Since the first report of a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) outbreak, tremendous efforts to control this disease, including various national policies and plans incorporating the use of multiple modified live-virus vaccines, have been made. However, PRRSV is still a significant threat to the swine industry, and new variants continually emerge as a result of PRRSV evolution. Several studies have shown that pandemic PRRSV strains have enormous genetic diversity and that commercial vaccines can only provide partial protection against these strains. Therefore, effective anti-PRRSV drugs may be more suitable and reliable for PRRSV control. In this study, we observed that isobavachalcone (IBC), which was first isolated from Psoralea corylifolia, had potent anti-PRRSV activity in vitro. Although many biological activities of IBC have been reported, this is the first report describing the antiviral activity of IBC.

d7cb7c135b8d3727e626d35b7b1ec92f2400e78b,,,,"{""Introduction"": ""In industrially developed countries the frequency and severity of the traditional occupational diseases have decreased in the past decades, thanks to improvements in work legislation and practices. However, working conditions are still far from being acceptable, let alone healthy, in all areas of the world. In many poorer countries, considerable numbers of workers are exposed to serious hazards associated with underground mining, various types of industry (metal, textile, wood, food, electronics, etc.) , construction, and agriculture. In industrially advanced countries, occupational lung diseases still occur as a consequence of working conditions of the past, but they also continue to occur, because occupational risks are still present in many jobs and novel risks emerge with the advent of new technologies.In general, it is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify exactly the contribution of occupation to the burden of respiratory disease. Exact figures of the incidence and prevalence of occupational lung disorders are often not available, even in countries where government agencies exist for reporting and compensating occupational diseases. This is due, in varying proportions, to legal and administrative restrictions in the eligibility for compensation, to a lack of obligation or incentive to notify occupational diseases, and to insufficient awareness, by physicians, of the possible occupational etiology of diseases in general. Thus, underreporting of occupational diseases is most likely to occur for pensioners, who are no longer at work, but whose condition may well be due to their previous job. However, even in working people, diagnoses of occupational disease, such as occupational asthma, are often missed for a variety of reasons. In various countries, schemes have been created for the voluntary reporting of occupational respiratory diseases by pneumologists and/or occupational physicians, for example, the Surveillance of Work Related and Occupational Respiratory Disease (SWORD) system in the UK or the Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR) Program, initiated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the US.Another, more generic reason for the underreporting of occupational lung disorders is that it is not always so easy to define occupational respiratory disease. Indeed, occupational respiratory diseases are not restricted to a limited range of highly specific occupational diseases, such as silicosis or asbestosis. Most common respiratory diseases, such as bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bronchopulmonary cancer, are caused by a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors, including occupational exposures. Thus, even though an occupational etiology is often difficult to substantiate and document in individual patients, the attributable fraction of occupational factors in mortality and morbidity from respiratory diseases is far from being negligible.This overview describes briefly the main categories of specific occupational respiratory disorders and it covers also briefly how work exposures are potential determinants of common respiratory conditions.Pneumoconiosis is defined as the accumulation of dust in the lungs and the reaction of tissues to its presence. The prolonged inhalation of coal-mine dust may result in the development of coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP), silicosis, and industrial chronic bronchitis and emphysema, either singly or in various combinations. CWP is the term generally applied to interstitial disease of the lung resulting from chronic exposure to coal dust, whereas silicosis is due to inhalation of dust containing silica. The pneumoconioses differ in a number of ways from the acute allergic and toxic interstitial diseases that are associated with exposure to organic dusts, principally because of the long latency period (usually 10-20 years or more) between exposure and recognition of the disease. CWP was first recognized in Scottish miners in 1830. In recent decades, the incidence of CWP has been declining in industrial countries due to improved dust controls, though increased mechanization in the mid-1960s led to a temporary increase in dust levels in some countries. Over the period 1950-80, the annual UK rate for the recognition of CWP for state compensation in working and retired miners decreased from about 7% to 1-2%. The overall prevalence of CWP in US coal miners declined from about 12.7% to 3.9% between 1969 and 1988, but there were substantial regional differences. The overall prevalence of simple CWP is 2.8%; the highest rate of 14% occurs in workers with 30 years or more of mining experience. Similar regional differences and similar declines have been noted in the US and other countries."", ""Acute Inhalation Injuries Inhalation Fever"": ""Inhalation fever is a clinical term used to describe influenza-like reactions that occur following a single exposure to high levels of: * metal fumes (mainly zinc), causing metal fume fever; * organic dusts (grain, cotton, etc.) and other bioaerosols contaminated with microorganisms and endotoxins and/or mycotoxins, causing the organic dust toxic syndrome (ODTS); and * fumes produced by heating plastics (mainly fluorine-containing polymers), causing polymer fume fever.These inhalation fevers are the clinical expressions of an intense nonallergic pulmonary inflammation, consisting mainly of neutrophils. These reactions are usually self-limited and not associated with much structural damage to the respiratory tract."", ""Toxic Acute Tracheobronchitis and Pneumonitis"": ""Severe injury to the respiratory tract may result from the inhalation of irritant or toxic gases, vapors, or complex aerosols released through explosions, fires, leaks, or spills from industrial installations, transport accidents, and military or terrorist operations. Depending on the nature of the chemical and the intensity of the exposure, there will be rhinitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, and/ or pneumonitis. Chemical pneumonitis is generally associated with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and may evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Organizing pneumonia with obliterating bronchitis may also be a feature of chemical injury to the terminal airspaces.In survivors of acute inhalation injury, there may be persisting structural lesions or functional sequelae, such as the reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS)."", ""Occupational Asthma"": ""In modern societies, occupational asthma is now considered the most frequent work-related respiratory disease. Occupational asthma is asthma that is causally related to an exposure at work. In addition to asthma that is caused -more or less clearly -by work, many asthmatics also experience a worsening of their asthma by their working circumstances. The latter is called 'work-aggravated asthma'. The contribution of occupational factors to the causation and the manifestations of bronchial asthma has been recently estimated to amount to 15% of adult asthmatics. Excess risks of asthma are found for farmers, painters, plastic workers, cleaners, spray painters, and agricultural workers.Depending on its pathogenesis, occupational asthma may be categorized into occupational asthma caused by immunologic (allergic) sensitization to a (specific) agent and asthma caused by other mechanisms."", ""Occupational Asthma Caused by Allergic Sensitization"": ""A large number of workplace agents have been shown to be capable of causing sensitization and occupational asthma. These occupational 'asthmogens' include:* macromolecules of biological origin, that is, (glyco)proteins derived from plants (flour, latex, etc.), animals (farm animals, laboratory animals, seafood, etc.), or microorganisms (enzymes in detergents, baking additives, animal feed, etc.); * low-molecular-weight chemicals of natural origin (e.g., wood-derived chemicals); * low-molecular-weight synthetic chemicals (diisocyanates and other reactive chemicals, pharmaceutical agents, reactive dyes, etc.); and * metallic agents (complex platinum salts, hexavalent chromium, cobalt, etc.).The mechanisms of sensitization involve IgE antibodies (for macromolecular antigens) or other less well-characterized immunological mechanisms (for chemicals)."", ""Occupational Asthma without Evidence of Specific Sensitization"": ""Irritant-induced occupational asthma may be caused either by a single acute inhalation accident (RADS), or through repeated or chronic exposure to excessive levels of irritants. The latter is still somewhat controversial. 'Asthma-like' disorders without evidence of sensitization are also found in workers exposed to (endotoxin-contaminated) vegetable dusts (e.g., byssinosis in cotton workers, asthma-like syndrome in grain handlers and in swine confinement workers). These may form the basis for the high prevalence of COPD in agricultural workers."", ""Interstitial Lung Disease Pneumoconioses"": ""Pneumoconioses are diseases of the lung parenchyma caused by the accumulation of dust particles or fibers in the lungs. Although individual susceptibility plays some role, pneumoconiosis is considered to be caused essentially by the progressive accumulation of toxic particles beyond the lung's normal clearance mechanisms. This leads to inflammation (characterized initially by increased numbers of alveolar macrophages) and various degrees and types of fibrosis, depending on the agent.Silicosis Silicosis has become relatively uncommon in industrialized countries, thanks to dust controls in the workplace. Hazardous exposures to silica (SiO 2 ) may occur in mining, tunnel drilling or stone quarrying, in processing stone or sand, in building and demolition, in foundries, in pottery or ceramic manufacture, in the abrasive use of sand (sandblasting), in the manipulation of calcined diatomaceous earth, and other sometimes unexpected settings. Free crystalline silica (in practice, mainly quartz and cristobalite) is highly fibrogenic and leads to the formation of silicotic noduli. These lead initially to 'simple silicosis', characterized radiologically by small discrete opacities, and through coalescence they give rise to larger nodular opacities, characteristic of 'progressive massive fibrosis' (PMF). Silicosis is also associated with other conditions, such as COPD, tuberculosis, bronchopulmonary cancer, and collagen disease, including systemic sclerosis.Coal workers' pneumoconiosis The pathology of coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) differs from that of silicosis, but both conditions share many clinical features, including the potential for evolution towards PMF. Hence, and because coal miners are also exposed to varying amounts of silica, CWP is sometimes considered as a mixed pneumoconiosis, labeled anthracosilicosis.Asbestosis Asbestosis (i.e., fibrosis of the lung parenchyma caused by asbestos) is found in patients who were heavily exposed to asbestos fibers (mainly chrysotile, and the serpentines crocidolite, amosite, and tremolite), for example, during the manufacture of asbestos-cement products, friction materials or fireproof textiles, or when using asbestos for heat insulation or fire protection purposes in construction, heating systems, power stations, furnaces, shipyards and railroads, etc. The incidence of asbestosis will continue to decrease in those countries where the use of asbestos has been forbidden. Nevertheless, a risk of asbestosis will remain for those engaged in asbestos removal and waste handling, as well as in developing countries where the use of asbestos is still allowed and poorly regulated. The pathology of asbestosis is very similar to that of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, from which it must be distinguished by the presence of asbestos bodies and/or associated asbestos pleural lesions.Less common pneumoconioses Less common pneumoconioses include those caused by nonfibrous silicates (such as talc, kaolin, or mica) or other minerals. Some compounds cause so-called benign pneumoconioses (e.g., siderosis, caused by iron dust), a term implying the lack of serious fibrosis and functional impairment.Some synthetic agents have also been associated with interstitial lung disease. Thus, exposure to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) dust has been shown to cause pneumoconiosis, and heavy exposure to synthetic microfibers (mainly nylon, but also polypropylene and polyethylene) can cause interstitial lung disease ('flock worker's lung'). Heavy exposure to aerosolized paints caused the Ardystil syndrome, a severe form of organizing pneumonia, in textile workers in Spain and in Algeria."", ""Chronic Beryllium Disease and Hard-Metal/Cobalt Lung Disease"": ""These diseases are not included among the mineral pneumoconioses here, because their occurrence does not appear to be based as much on dust accumulation, as on individual susceptibility.Chronic beryllium disease Chronic beryllium disease (CBD) or berylliosis is caused by sensitization to beryllium (Be), a light metal that is increasingly used in modern technology. CBD is a granulomatous lung disease and is clinically and pathologically similar to sarcoidosis. CBD is caused by a cell-mediated sensitization to Be, which can be demonstrated by proliferation of lymphocytes from peripheral blood or bronchoalveolar lavage upon incubation with Be salts. The HLA-DPb1 Glu69 allele confers a strong genetic susceptibility to develop CBD.Other agents (e.g., talc, zirconium) have been associated with granulomatous lung disease, masquerading as sarcoidosis.Hard-metal lung disease Hard-metal lung disease is a rare disease caused, in susceptible individuals, by exposure to cobalt (Co), as a component of hard metal (a composite based on tungsten carbide) or diamond-cobalt. Clinically the disease resembles hypersensitivity pneumonitis, although little evidence exists for an immune reaction against Co. In its most typical presentation, its pathology is characterized by giant cell interstitial pneumonia (GIP). The pathogenesis of hard-metal lung disease is not clear, but it may be related to the generation of oxidant species from the oxidation of Co."", ""Extrinsic Allergic Alveolitis/Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis"": ""Occupational causes of extrinsic allergic alveolitis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis are quite diverse. The more common etiologies consist of dusts originating from microorganisms (farmer's lung, humidifier's lung) or from birds (pigeon breeder's lung, bird fancier's lung). However, all environments where there is inhalation of bio-aerosols should be considered as carrying a risk of extrinsic allergic alveolitis. These include mushroom farms, composting installations, wood processing, vegetable storage, machining shops (through the use of machining fluids), etc. Some chemicals, most notably isocyanates, may also cause the condition.Occupational extrinsic allergic alveolitis has been studied most in farmers, in whom the disease is caused by sensitization to (thermophilic) microorganisms that grow in hay or other organic substrates. The frequency of farmer's lung exhibits a considerable geographic variation, depending on climatic factors and farming practices, and the causative antigens also differ between regions. It is most frequent in the cold humid climates of northern Europe and America or in mountainous areas, such as the Doubs in France."", ""Occupational Infections"": ""Most respiratory infections are community-acquired, but sometimes they may be related to specific occupations. Common viral or, more rarely, bacterial infections may affect those working in crowded environments, schools, hospitals, and other communities. Immune-compromised subjects are at increased risk of acquiring invasive fungal infections in some work environments.Tuberculosis is a well-recognized risk in health workers, but other categories of workers may be at risk, such as prison guards or social workers. Emerging infections pose a particular threat to hospital workers and their families, as shown by the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).Workers involved in maintaining (hot) water pipes, reservoirs, pumps, or fountains may be at risk of contracting Legionella pneumonia. Working in wild environments may lead to infections such as histoplasmosis, tularemia, or hantavirus pneumonia. Other zoonoses, such as anthrax, Q fever, ornithosis, avian influenza, affect workers in jobs involving direct or indirect contact with farm animals or birds. Moreover, dissemination of anthrax and other microorganisms by terrorists is a definite threat for various categories of workers, such as postal workers, maintenance workers, law enforcement personnel, and health workers.It is not established to what extent microorganisms and biological contaminants are responsible, together with indoor climate factors and volatile organic compounds, as well as psychosocial factors, for outbreaks of the 'sick-building syndrome'. This syndrome refers to the occurrence, in a large proportion of the workforce, of non-specific work-related respiratory and other complaints among occupants of some buildings, particularly air-conditioned office buildings."", ""Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease"": ""Although the dominant cause of COPD is cigarette smoking, there is little doubt that occupational exposures to mineral dusts, organic dusts, and irritant gases or vapors contribute to the incidence and the severity of chronic airways disease, including COPD. The quantitative contribution of occupational factors to the burden of COPD morbidity or mortality has been estimated at 15%.The most common respiratory manifestation of exposure to dusts or fumes consists of the presence of chronic bronchitis, that is, 'industrial bronchitis', which may or may not be associated with airflow limitation. Several longitudinal studies have shown that exposure to mine dust is associated with a loss of ventilatory function, even in the absence of pneumoconiosis. Other occupations with exposure to mineral dusts (such as building workers) or fumes (such as welders) are probably also at risk of occupationally induced COPD. Exposure to agricultural dusts (such as grain dust or vegetable fibers) is also a significant cause of chronic airway disease."", ""Bronchopulmonary Cancer"": ""As is the case for COPD, the most important exogenous factor in causing bronchopulmonary cancer is cigarette smoking. However, numerous epidemiological studies have investigated the role of occupational exposures in causing lung cancer, and despite the many difficulties of such studies, many occupational agents (or jobs) have been identified as definite or probable causes of lung cancer. Thus, asbestos fibers, some chromium(VI) compounds, arsenic, radon gas and its decay products (radon daughters), bis(chloromethyl)ether (BCME), and crystalline silica (occupational exposure) are well-established human lung carcinogens (belonging to category 1 of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)). Depending on the agent, as well as on methodological aspects, additive or multiplicative modes of interaction have been shown to operate with cigarette smoking. Established carcinogenic processes for the lung include coke production and coal gasification (possibly related to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), iron and steel founding, paint manufacture and painting. Occupational exposure to diesel exhaust and environmental tobacco smoke are also probable causes of lung cancer, although the magnitude of the risk is smaller than that found for the established carcinogenic agents.The contribution of occupation to the causation of lung cancer has been shown to be considerably larger than for most other common cancers. The most frequently quoted estimate is 15% for males and 5% for females, and occupational asbestos exposure is considered the most influential factor."", ""Pleural Disease"": ""Occupational pleural disorders concern almost exclusively those who have had exposure to asbestos fibers (and perhaps also refractory ceramic fibers). Nonoccupational (domestic or environmental) exposures to industrial asbestos fibers or to mineral fibers such as tremolite may also cause such lesions.Asbestos-related pleural plaques are focal areas of essentially noncellular thickening of the (parietal) pleura; they are often bilateral and they may be calcified. They may occur even in people who have had only a light exposure to asbestos. It is generally accepted that the mere presence of asbestos-induced pleural plaques does not lead to symptoms or impairment and that such plaques are not precursors of a malignant evolution. However, pleural plaques may be considered as fairly specific biomarkers of previous asbestos exposure. Asbestos may also cause nonmalignant pleural effusions, diffuse pleural fibrosis, and round atelectasis.Malignant mesothelioma is a pleural (or pericardial or peritoneal) tumor that is very specific for past asbestos exposure, either occupationally or environmentally. The latency between exposure and the manifestations of the tumor is usually 30 years or more; the tumor carries a very poor prognosis and may occur even after brief or low exposures. The incidence of mesothelioma has paralleled the industrial use of asbestos and its incidence will continue to increase until approximately 2010 to 2020 in most European countries.Schenker MBC (1998) "", ""Etiology"": ""Coal dust is not a mineral of fixed composition and comprises coal and quartz in various proportions. Coal is graded by rank, the rank reflecting its carbon content and thus coal quality and combustibility; anthracite is the highest ranked coal, with a carbon content of around 98%. Lower-ranked coals have carbon contents of around 90-95% carbon. The rank of coal has an influence on the risk of disease (higher-rank coals entail higher risk than lower-rank coals) and the progression of pneumoconiosis. Exposure to coal dust with a quartz concentration greater than 15% is associated with a high risk of a rapidly progressive form of pneumoconiosis that has the characteristics of silicosis. In open mines, dust levels rarely approach those of underground mines. Coal is currently actively mined in the US, UK, Western and Eastern Europe, India, China, South America, Australia, and Africa.There are three groups of factors that are known to influence the character and severity of lung tissue reaction to the mineral dusts. The risk of pneumoconiosis is related to the intensity and years of exposure. However, among a group of workers exposed to the same dust, only a fraction develop pneumoconiosis, because of an individual susceptibility. The nature and properties of each specific dust constitute the third factor under consideration; for each mineral, geometric and aerodynamic properties, chemistry, and surface properties have to be considered. In order to cause pneumoconiosis, particles must be small enough (0.5-5 mm) to reach the respiratory bronchioles and be deposited there."", ""Pathology"": ""The lesions of CWP are focal in nature. Simple CWP is associated with the macular and nodular lesions, whereas complicated CWP is associated with progressive massive fibrosis (PMF, opacity lesion of 1 cm in diameter or more) and the lesions of rheumatoid pneumoconiosis (Caplan's syndrome). On gross""}",OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES | Overview,"This overview describes the main categories of specific occupational disorders and it covers also how work exposures are potential determinants of common respiratory conditions. Acute inhalation injuries may present as inhalation fever or as acute tracheobronchitis and pneumonitis. Occupational asthma is the most frequent work-related respiratory disease. It may be caused by allergic sensitization to macromolecules of biologic origin or to chemicals of low molecular weight, as well as by (heavy) exposure to workplace irritants. The pneumoconioses are caused by the accumulation of dust particles or fibres in the lungs. They include silicosis, coal workers’ pneumoconioses, asbestosis and other less common pneumoconioses. Chronic beryllium disease is caused by a cell-mediated sensitization to beryllium and resembles sarcoidosis. Hard-metal lung disease is caused by sensitivity to cobalt and resembles hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis is generally caused by sensitization to aerosolized biological antigens. Several types of infections may be related more or less specifically to work. Chronic obstructive lung disease is mainly caused by cigarette smoking, but exposure to dusts and gases contribute to its incidence. Similarly, bronchopulmonary cancer is not only caused by smoking, but also by occupational agents, most notably asbestos. Asbestos is also a cause of nonmalignant and malignant pleural disease.",10.1016/b0-12-370879-6/00269-6,Elsevier; PMC,PMC7149334,,els-covid,2006-12-31,Encyclopedia of Respiratory Medicine,,,,53817655.0,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B0123708796002696; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0123708796002696,2006.0,paper

When coupled with sophisticated models of evolution pathogen sequences can be used to look into epidemiological features such as cryptic transmission [1], migration [2, 3], and origins [4] of infectious diseases amongst others. Pathogen sequences also contain information about past temporal dynamics before sequence data have been collected [5] due to the pattern of shared and unique mutations inherited from preceding generations. Molecular *Correspondence: gytisdudas@gmail.com 1 Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N, 98109 Seattle, USA 2 Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre, Carl Skottsbergs gata 22B, 413 19 Gothenburg, Sweden phylogenetic approaches rely on decoding these patterns of shared mutations into a nested graph known as the phylogenetic tree. Pathogens often have short generation times and some, like RNA viruses, also possess polymerases with low replication fidelity such that mutations are generated at a rapid pace [6, 7] leading to fast differentiation of pathogen lineages at the genetic level as they spread. With appropriate sampling and information (\""metadata\"") about sequences historic population dynamics can be inferred and quantified from pathogen phylogenies. Changes in pathogen population sizes over time [8] , inference of unobserved ancestral states [9] , correlates of processes [10, 11] , and overall phylodynamic [12] patterns can be inferred from molecular phylogenies and used to understand patterns of pathogen transmission at a number of scales.Before widespread adoption of high-throughput sequencing limitations and costs led to amplification and sequencing of short fragments of pathogen genomes [13, 14] . These subgenomic fragments were often chosen for their diversity such as viral surface glycoproteins that experience selective pressures from vertebrate immune systems or their utility such as routine sequencing of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pol gene to test for drug resistance [15, 16] . Whilst subgenomic fragments of pathogens are very accurate and specific as diagnostic markers and informative about long-term evolution their length (dictated by the compromise between information content and ease of sequencing) limits their utility in detailed molecular epidemiology investigations for example during outbreaks [17] as only mutations occurring within the small region of the genome that is sequenced are available for phylogenetic inference.Molecular clocks have been particularly useful in molecular epidemiology where the accumulation of mutations between sequences is used as a noisy approximation for elapsed time, given either times of events in the phylogeny (sequence dates or dates of common ancestors) or a previously determined molecular clock rate. Generally neutral pathogen variation at the nucleotide level ebbs and flows under the forces of population genetics unlike beneficial or deleterious variation which tends to either fix or be purged rapidly, respectively. Due to their random and discrete nature mutations are modelled as a Poisson process [18] where the waiting time t for observing a mutation at a single site is exponentially distributed with evolutionary rate parameter R. The probability of observing 0 mutations at a single site after time t is e \u2212Rt and the probability of at least one mutation is therefore 1 \u2212 e \u2212Rt . Higher evolutionary rates R or waiting times t result in higher probabilities of observing at least one mutation at the site in question. Since sites are assumed to evolve independently the probability of observing at least one mutation across L sites iswhere RL is expressed in substitutions per year (rate in substitutions per site per year multiplied by number of sites). Since the probability of observing at least one mutation changes depending on waiting time (and vice versa) we instead focus on the mean waiting time until at least one mutation appears. The mean of an exponential distribution is \u03bb \u22121 where \u03bb in our case is RL such that mean waiting timet under a given evolutionary rate R and sequence length L becomesWhen the evolutionary rate R or sequence length L are low mean waiting timest are lengthened and vice versa. It also suggests a worrying relationship between R, L, andt -a reduction in either R or L leads to a reciprocal reduction int such that reducing the number of sites by 10%, for example, requires a 1 0.9 = 1.11(1)-fold increase in evolutionary rate to maintain the same temporal resolutiont or risk increasing the waiting time for a mutation by the same amount (i.e. \u224811% or 0.9 of the original resolution available). This gets worse reciprocally such that halving the sites requires doubling the evolutionary rate, using 10% of the sites requires a ten-fold increase in evolutionary rate, etc.Since both maximum plausible evolutionary rates R and genome length G are largely dictated by deleterious mutation load neither quantity will vary substantially for a given pathogen though individually R and G can vary substantially where for example viruses have high R and low G on average and bacteria have higher G but lower R. Sequencing recovers some fraction f of the genome length G (L = Gf ) for analyses and sequencing complete genomes (f = 1.0; L = G) is the best possible scenario since sequencing any shorter region requires the evolutionary rate to increase by a factor of 1 f which even if L = 0.4G means the evolutionary rate would have to be 2.5 times faster in the remaining 0.4 of the genome to be able to record information in the form of mutations at the same speed as complete genomes. The message of our manuscript, at least as far as densely sampled infectious disease outbreaks go, is that the task of sequencing a complete pathogen genome will rarely be as miserable a task as analysing a fraction of one.In this study we show this by quantifying how much information relevant to phylodynamic analysis is lost when shorter genomic regions are used instead of full genomes. By focusing our attention on a subset (600 sequences) of a well-characterised genomic sequence data (comprised of >1600 viral genomes) set derived from the West African Ebola virus epidemic of 2013-2015 [11] we estimate loss in precision and accuracy of molecular clock models and phylogeographic inference methods when only the glycoprotein gene (GP), a region representing just 10% of the viral genome, is analysed despite GP evolving at rates faster than the genomic average. Our methods rely on masking tip dates and locations for 60 (10%) of the sequences in a classic training-testing split where we re-infer these parameters as latent variables using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We show that this reduction in data not only leads to severe mixing issues in MCMC analyses by removing the constraints additional data impose on plausible parameter space without adding restrictive priors to compensate, but can also result in unreliable tip date and location inference. Despite achieving much better temporal resolution when using complete viral genomes we still find residual error caused by inherent randomness of mutations which is close to theoretical expectations (Eq 2). We refer to this as the temporal horizon, i.e. a temporal resolution limit where population processes occurring at a rate faster than the rate at which mutations enter and are observed in a population will not be captured with high fidelity even with genome sequences. Figure 1 shows the reconstructed phylogenies in substitution space (right) and time space (left) for 600 complete Ebola virus genomes (top) or just GP sequences (bottom). Although higher levels of divergence are observed in the Fig. 1 Phylogenies of West African Ebola virus genomes (top) or GP sequences (bottom). Temporal phylogenies recovered using BEAST are shown on the left and maximum likelihood phylogenies recovered with RAxML are on the right. Tips are coloured based on country (Sierra Leone in blue, Liberia in red, Guinea in green) and location (lighter colours indicate administrative divisions lying towards west of the country). Tips outlined in white indicate the 60 chosen for date and location masking, ticks to the right of phylogenies indicate the y positions of masked tips coloured by their true location. In temporal phylogenies branches are also coloured based on GLM-inferred ancestral locations. Nodes in temporal phylogenies with <0.10 posterior probability are indicated with grey X marks. Maximum likelihood phylogenies on the right are rooted via temporal regression in TreeTime GP dataset, as seen from tree height, the differences in the number of non-polytomic nodes between genomic and GP data are clear, indicating substantially better resolution in disentangling the exact relationships between lineages in the former. Additional file 1 shows where in the better resolved maximum likelihood phylogeny of genome sequences the mutations that occurred in just the region spanning the GP gene are located with continuous blocks of colours corresponding to regions of the tree that would become collapsed if only the GP data were used and the tree were inferred correctly. Internal branches of a phylogeny correspond to hypotheses of common ancestry and in the case of GP only 42 internal nodes are identified in the maximum likelihood phylogeny compared to 210 internal nodes for complete genomes. The one aspect of the West African epidemic that can be inferred from both GP and genome phylogenies is that the virus' origins lie in Guinea but details of its onwards spread are largely lost in the GP phylogeny. Genomic data, on the other hand, despite a reduction from over 1600 sequences described in the original study [11] down to just 600 still contain information about the role of Sierra Leone's epidemic in maintaining transmission across the region through both endemic proliferation of lineages and their spread to neighbouring countries."", ""Loss of phylogenetic signal"": ""Unlike maximum likelihood phylogenies where branch lengths are directly proportional to the expected number of substitutions branch lengths in temporal phylogenies are usually smoothed out by the fact that a range of dates are compatible with a given number of mutations on a branch. Thus even large polytomies can be resolved into a branching structure derived from the tree prior albeit without much support for any given configuration. So despite the maximum likelihood of GP exhibiting a lot of polytomies ( Fig. 1 ) the corresponding temporal phylogeny (left) does not, though it is more star-shaped than its genome equivalent with long external branches as well as numerous nodes with less than 0.10 posterior support (marked by grey crosses). Though the trees were too large to estimate robust tree distance statistics such as subtree prune and regraft (SPR) distances, Robinson-Foulds distances are not, and are smaller between the GP and genome maximum likelihood trees (188) than between Bayesian timetrees (1068). There are also noticeable differences in total tree length and whereas it is entirely expected that the maximum likelihood tree of GP should be larger (0.08076 substitutions/site) than the genome substitution phylogeny (0.06782 subs/site) due to the former's faster rate of evolution the tree length of time trees differ 2-fold -80.299 years for genome versus 173.018 years for GP. There is also a noticeable degree of branch clustering by country in the GP temporal phylogeny possibly caused by proximity of locations within country which in the absence of genetic information cannot be resolved to the same degree as with genomic data.In contrast to the maximum likelihood phylogeny of GP on the right (Fig. 1 ) its corresponding temporal phylogeny on the left exhibits a reconstruction of the West African epidemic largely consistent with what has been established previously [11] . This is likely to be caused by the combined effects of two sources of information. First, additional information is added by specifying the collection dates for sequences which might exclude certain topologies from being considered during MCMC on account of the relatively small effective population size of Ebola virus in West Africa. Second, the generalised linear model approach to inferring migration is informationrich as it provides over 3000 possible parameter values (pairwise migration rates between locations) per predictor matrix and thus if a few branches are strongly selecting for a \""correct\"" predictor matrix to be included in the migration model that predictor matrix can then be used to determine the likely locations of branches for which less information is available. However, a simpler continuous time Markov chain model where each individual pairwise migration rate is inferred individually in a maximum likelihood framework exhibits broadly similar patterns too (Additional file 2)."", ""Loss of temporal information"": ""Inferring masked tip dates from 10% of the sequences (Fig. 2) is an intuitive way to show both the inherent noisiness of molecular clock estimates as reflected in the width of 95% highest posterior density intervals for inferred dates and the differences in temporal resolution between GP and genome alignments. True collection dates for genomes are mostly (56 out of 60, corresponding to a coverage probability of 0.93) within the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) of estimated dates and the mean absolute error is \u224822 days across all masked tips. In contrast the 95% HPDs for inferred dates in the GP dataset capture more of the true dates (58 out of 60, coverage probability \u22480.96) at the cost of markedly reduced precision with mean absolute error going up to \u2248106 days or \u223c3.5 months. Despite having lower coverage probability more precise date estimates are derived from complete genomes with an average 95% HPD width of \u2248102 days compared to \u2248458 days for GP. Another way of thinking about where the loss of information occurs is to consider root-to-tip against tip date regressions shown in Additional file 3 where waiting times for mutations are too long to estimate the slope of the regression reliably as every new mutation is seen across sequences collected over a longer interval of time. Observed errors ( Fig. 2 but also Additional file 4 for maximum likelihood equivalent) for both datasets are very close to theoretical expectations calculated using Eq. 2: 22 (observed) versus 20 (expected) days for Ebola Fig. 2 Masked tip date inference from genomes (left) and GP sequences (right). Inferred collection dates in the masked set based on genomes (red, left) and GP sequences (blue, right). Each vertical line corresponds to the 95% highest posterior density for the inferred tip date (y-axis) coloured red (genome) or blue (GP) if it falls within the true collection date (x-axis) and black otherwise. Dashed diagonal line indicates the 1-to-1 line. A histogram of signed residual errors between mean posterior date estimate and true date for each masked tip is shown in the second row with the black hatch indicating the mean. A histogram of absolute residual errors (accuracy) between mean posterior date estimate and true date for each masked tip is shown in the third row with the black hatch indicating the mean and the higher black hatch topped with a circle corresponding to a theoretical expectation based on Eq 2. Fourth row shows the histogram of confidence interval widths for date estimates (precision) virus genomes and 106 (observed) versus 113 (expected) days for GP. Also note that for many tips in the GP data set independent Markov chains in some cases converged on, and in other cases sampled from, different distributions for masked tip dates (i.e. local maxima) resulting in multipeaked posterior samples after combining independent analyses."", ""Migration model is strongly informed by tip dates and locations"": ""Differences between genomic and GP datasets are clear and dramatic when looking at both phylogenies ( Fig. 1 ) and masked date inference ( Fig. 2 ) but less pronounced when trying to infer the location of a masked tip (Fig. 3) . Although locations are correctly inferred more often and with greater support in genomic sequences compared to just the GP gene there are numerous tips whose locations are not correctly inferred even from genome sequences ( Fig. 3 and Additional file 5 for maximum likelihood equivalent). This might reflect the nature of these parameters of interest since phylogenies and date inference ultimately draw information from mutation accumulation via relatively straightforward models of sequence evolution with limited parameter space. In contrast, migration processes are far more complicated and nuanced without a de facto standard for modelling though continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) approaches are widely used with most advanced methods relying on generalised linear models without excessive over-parameterisation. Despite the lack of strong contrast in power to infer masked locations between genomes and GP sequences cross entropies indicate better performance with complete genomes (6054.631 nats) than with GP (9905.726 nats).Similarly, locations are inferred correctly more often with complete genomes than with GP sequences where the maximum probability location (i.e. the model's best guess) matches the truth. Specifically, using complete genomes results in 0.540 probability of guessing correctly compared to 0.286 probability for GP (for a calibration of both models see Additional file 6). The model makes these guesses with more certainty too where the mean probability of the true location is 0.482 with genomes and 0.219 with GP and mean probability of best guess (i.e. maximum probability) is 0.680 and 0.396, respectively. We also calculated the great circle distances between the population centroids of true and each predicted location weighed by probability which should ideally be 0.0 (0 km distance multiplied by probability of 1.0). The mean of these distances across masked tips are 75.886 kilometres for genomes compared to 164.309 km for GP sequences.In addition to assessing how well tip locations can be inferred from genetic information we also looked at how well historical patterns were reconstructed from sequence data. To accomplish this we looked at the posterior distribution of ancestral locations of lineages that gave rise to four sequences in the data. The four lineages were chosen for their well-characterised histories in the broader epidemic as well as complexity of migration. Note that when we describe the movements of these lineages they are referred to by the strains that would eventually descend from them but it should in no way be interpreted as a single virus or patient moving around the region throughout the epidemic. Instead, all four strains share a number of common ancestors (the tree that would describe their relationships can be represented as ((('14859_EMLK' , 'MK3462'), 'EM_004422'), 'PL5294');) whose locations can be inferred from the geographic distribution of their relatives and descendants.Of the four representative sequenced viruses chosen three ('14859_EMLK' , 'MK3462' , 'EM_004422') are descended from the viral lineage that jumped across the border from Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou prefecture in Guinea into Kailahun district in Sierra Leone. The common ancestor of two of those ('14859_EMLK' and 'MK3462') continued onto Kenema district in Sierra Leone from Kailahun district (also Sierra Leone). Unlike the lineage/transmission chain that eventually gave rise to strain '14859_EMLK' which continued onto Conakry prefecture in Guinea and back-spilled into Sierra Leone's Kambia district (where the descendent strain '14859_EMLK' was collected [19] ) right across the border later in the epidemic, the lineage/transmission chain that was ancestral to 'MK3462' stayed in Sierra Leone for the remainder of the epidemic and found itself moved westwards towards Freetown (Western Urban and Western Rural districts) until finally jumping to Bombali district where its descendent strain was collected from a patient [19] . Unlike all the other three lineages the transmission chain/lineage (\""lineage A\"" [20] ) that would leave strain 'PL5294' as a descendent is thought to have been largely restricted to the environs of Conakry prefecture in Guinea. An older ancestor of strain 'PL5294' had migrated from Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou prefecture into Conakry prefecture on the other side of the country relatively early in the epidemic where its descendents circulated for a large portion of the West African epidemic though unlike a lot of its relatives the direct ancestor that would eventually give rise to strain 'PL5294' spilled over into Kambia district of Sierra Leone [19] . Finally, the transmission chain/lineage that would eventually give rise to strain 'EM_004422' had a tumultous history in the region. Strains 'EM_004422' , '14859_EMLK' and 'MK3462' all shared the same common ancestor in Kailahun district of Sierra Leone but the progenitor of strain 'EM_004422' , unlike its relatives, made a jump to Liberia (Lofa and Montserrado counties) from where its descendants spilled back into Macenta prefecture in Guinea. This transmission chain would later leave descendants (of which 'EM_004422' is representative) that jumped to neighbouring Kissidougou prefecture (also Guinea) and where strain 'EM_004422' was collected [20] .The histories of the lineages that gave rise to these four tips are for the most part reconstructed from both GP sequences and genomes consistently (Fig. 4) likely as a result of additional information brought in by specifying tip dates and their collection locations. Genomic data tend to concentrate the probability mass towards a single location at any given time in contrast to GP sequences where several locations can be considered with non-negligible probabilities at numerous time points (Fig. 4 and Additional file 7) and where timing of ancestral migration events is considerably more diffuse or even substantially off (i.e. Fig. 4a and d) . What is even more apparent is that without the additional information available when using complete genomes and without aiding the sampling with strongly informative priors MCMC explores a wider variety of low-probability migration paths as indicated by maps on the right of each plot in Fig. 4 . In the case of the ancestral lineage of 'EM_004422' , for example, a series of migrations through distant Conakry (western Guinea) are reconstructed with relatively high confidence from GP sequences compared to shorter distance migrations that run through neighbouring Liberia reconstructed from genomes.Despite markedly reduced information content for both total number of sequences (>1600 to 600) and additional loss of information in GP (\u224890% fewer sites) sequences the same core correlates of migration are recovered for both datasets in the generalised linear model (Fig. 5) compared to previous findings using all available sequence data. These are: population sizes at origin and destination locations, within country migration effect, and great circle distances which are identified as strong predictors of migration with high (>50 Bayes factor, BF) albeit not categorical support (Fig. 5) . Four other migration predictors for the GP dataset have support >5 BF and <15 BF which are international and national border sharing, Liberia-Guinea asymmetry, and index of temperature seasonality at origin. Of these Liberia-Guinea asymmetry and international border sharing are also found to be good predictors of migration in genomic data though The inferred ancestral branch location is logged at time points along the path from selected tips to the root of the tree across the posterior distribution of trees. The smoothed trajectories are an indication of where and when a lineage that gave rise to a particular tip is inferred to have existed. Maps on the right show migration events that are inferred to have taken place coloured by their posterior probability with migrations with <0.05 posterior support are shown as dotted white lines. All lineages share a common ancestor in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou prefecture of Guinea (white outline in the map) where the original zoonotic transmission event occurred near the Guinean border with Sierra Leone and Liberia. Some lineages are also descended from an early spillover event into Sierra Leone confusingly Liberia-Guinea asymmetry has the opposite correlation sign with GP sequence data. Apart from this deviation predictors for both genome and GP gene datasets mostly have the same sign and very similar effect sizes. As mentioned previously (Figs. 1 and 4) this suggests substantial amounts of information being derived from collection dates and locations of tips rather than genetic information. The reduction in total numbers of sequences as well as reduced phylogenetic information in the GP dataset appears to enable the migration model to explore combinations of predictors that would otherwise be confidently excluded with complete genomes and thus a larger number of predictor matrices is included in the migration model with low probabilities. The differences between genomic and GP data though seemingly small (e.g. Fig. 3 ) is more pronounced when looking at total entropy of inclusion probabilities: 1.285 nats for genome data, and 2.688 for GP sequences."", ""Temporal resolution"": ""As discussed in the introduction the mean waiting time for a mutation is 1/RL (Eq. 2) and depends on the rate at which mutations arise and are sampled by sequencing (evolutionary rate, R) and number of sites under observation (alignment length, L). Since 1/RL defines a linear relationship between rate R and length L mean waiting times for mutation can be reduced by an increase in either R or L. In order to double temporal resolution one can either double the evolutionary rate R or double the alignment length L. The former is generally outside the researchers' control though genomic regions evolving at a faster rate exist in many pathogens. How much faster smaller regions evolve will depend on forces of population genetics such as ability to recombine with respect to the rest of the genome (strength of Hill-Robertson effect [21] ) as well as positive selection or functional constraints. It is thus unlikely that significantly higher rates will offset the reduction in resolution caused by focusing on a very small genomic region. Extending the region that is sequenced, on the other hand, is often trivial outside of resource-limited areas and can dramatically improve temporal resolution.To help researchers intuit the impact of sequence length and evolutionary rate on temporal resolution we show the relationship between evolutionary rate and alignment length in determining mean waiting times until a mutation is observed in Fig. 6 . In addition to theoretical expectations we also show where a variety of viral pathogens fall along the two axes -estimated evolutionary rates with uncertainty intervals on the y-axis and alignment length on the x-axis. Subgenomic alignments shown in Fig. 6 include the small hydrophobic (SH) gene of mumps virus [22] and glycoprotein (GP) sequences of Ebola virus analysed in this study as well as sequences of two human influenza A viruses: genome of subtype H1N1/09 [23] , and haemagglutinin sequences of subtypes H1N1/09 [4] and H3N2 [24] , sequences of two commonly studied bloodborne pathogens: pol, env, and coding regions of HIV-1M [25] and nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) region of hepatitis C virus [26] . With respect to temporal resolution influenza A virus haemagglutinin gene (HA) is expected to acquire a mutation every one to two months on average compared to around three to six months for Ebola virus GP and over a year for mumps virus SH. Though all of these sequences are from (-)ssRNA viruses SH and GP genes are part of a single non-recombining RNA genome [27] whereas HA genes of influenza A viruses are encoded on their own segment which can be unlinked from their Fig. 6 Mean waiting times for a mutation as a function of alignment length and evolutionary rate. Contours correspond to mean waiting times under a given combination of alignment length and evolutionary rate. Genomes and barcode genes for a variety of viruses are shown with reported evolutionary rate confidence intervals (vertical lines) and including analyses of Ebola virus genomes (red violin) and GP sequences (blue violin) reported here. Most genomes occupy parameter space implying temporal resolution of a mutation once every month or so. Subgenomic fragments on the other hand are expected to have mean mutation waiting times of more than a month genomic background via reassortment. Because Ebola and mumps virus genomes do not recombine their polymerases may have been selected for higher fidelity due to Hill-Robertson effect.Complete genomes, on the other hand, occupy parameter space that implies that a new mutation occurs on average every month or every few weeks. This is achieved through having more sites rather than substantial differences in evolutionary rates, which differ only marginally with respect to subgenomic fragments. Despite this no virus is expected to acquire mutations faster than about once per week on average and the two genomes with highest predicted temporal resolution -Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and H1N1/09 -are difficult to analyse due to recombination and reassortment, respectively, though advances are being made in modelling reticulate evolution [28] . The inverse relationship between observed evolutionary rate and sequence length is similar but not the same as the relationship between virus genome sizes and mutation rates where high mutation rates and large genome sizes lead to substantial deleterious mutation load [29] . This upper limit on mutation waiting times set by optimal evolutionary rates is what we refer to as the temporal horizon -population processes with inverse of rate (i.e. waiting time) less than the rate at which a pathogen acquires mutations will not be captured with high fidelity by currently existing methods. The exact relationship between mutation waiting times and rates of processes will of course be complicated by the presence of co-circulating lineages, site-wise rate heterogeneity, and choice of model for population processes of interest."", ""Theoretical considerations"": ""For studies focused on temporal dynamics of pathogens over shorter periods of time the waiting time for a mutation should ideally be smaller than the inverse of the rate at which a process of interest occurs. Serial interval is often of most interest usually and has been addressed previously [30, 31] but migration or cross-species transmission rates could also exceed the critical temporal resolution threshold if sequences are assigned to compartments that are too small, i.e. the granularity of the analysis is increased by using a larger state space in the model. It is likely that this resolution limit will be improved greatly in the future by including additional information, either some aspects of a known transmission tree or more likely pathogen variation at the within-individual level where variant sharing between two or more individuals is evidence of their linkage in a transmission cluster. Much like evolutionary rates these methods might encounter biological limits outside of researchers' control, however.In addition to emphasising the need to sequence complete pathogen genomes we also hope that our study imparts the interpretation of pathogen evolutionary rates as primarily a parameter indicating temporal resolution of sequence data rather than a parameter of particular biological relevance. There have been previous incidents were a misunderstanding of the relationship between evolutionary rates and alignment length has been used to argue that low within-outbreak divergence in Ebola virus GP during the outbreak in Kikwit (Democratic Republic of Kongo) in 1995 was evidence of \""genetic stability\"" [32] . What is far more likely to have taken place, however, is the phenomenon we show with our GP data ( Fig. 1 and Additional file 1) where even after more than two years of the West African epidemic the GP gene is too short to accumulate appreciable numbers of mutations. Higher reported evolutionary rates early in the West African epidemic [33] have also been misreported as having biological meaning though not by the original study [34, 35] and arose through intense sequencing of a single transmission chain where mildly deleterious viral variants might not have been purged by purifying selection. We hope that our study clarifies that evolutionary rates are primarily a parameter of statistical resolution rather than of evolutionary forces and on their own are not sufficient to correctly interpret molecular clock data. Ideally, in the future sequence length and elapsed time will be included next to evolutionary rate estimates in order to transparently communicate statistical power available for analysis.There is an additional Bayesian phylogenetic argument to be made in favour of using complete genomes. Molecular clock phylogenetics often relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees [36] . Sequences which fall into polytomies in substitution phylogenies (i.e. well-defined common ancestry but no indication of exact branching order) are particularly problematic since plausible temporal phylogenies can be reconstructed in the absence of mutations. The branching order of such clades in time trees will be determined via the tree prior since no information about branching order can be recovered from the sequences themselves. There are over 34 million possible rooted trees for a set of 10 sequences but many of these might not be visited during MCMC if, for example, sequences are collected over time and effective population size (N e ) is low. Nonetheless, MCMC is particularly inefficient at sampling tree topologies for identical sequences [37] since increasing the number of identical sequences leads to expansion of search space without adding additional information that could constrain the search. Until reliable methods are developed and standardised the current solution is to reduce the numbers of identical sequences going into temporal MCMC analyses."", ""Practical considerations"": ""As well as temporal resolution concerns raised previously there are practical issues to consider when sequencing pathogens. Although many pathogens have established \""barcode\"" genes or regions [38] some do not. This can easily lead to different groups sequencing different pathogen genes by chance or choice as has happened with Ebola virus previously where GP [39] , a short fragment of the polymerase [40] , or nucleoprotein [41] were sequenced which is not necessarily a problem when sufficient complete genomes are available to bridge information between disparate regions and appropriate methods of analysis are used [42] . Sequencing complete pathogen genomes in addition to providing the best possible resolution temporally in terms of mutation content (Fig. 6 ) also ends up aiding in standardising data between studies in the sense that a sequenced genome is a complete unit of data and there is nothing more to be done for sequence data except gathering better metadata.It is also worth considering that the lifetime of sequence data extend beyond publication. Most scientific studies are designed with specific questions in mind that guide how data are collected and analysed to improve the researchers' ability to detect differences. This makes combining data across studies with different goals (and correspondingly different data and approaches to analysing them) challenging. Sequence data on the other hand only become difficult to combine when sequences are too diverged to reliably align or are too numerous to infer phylogenies in reasonable time. Since divergence levels are generally low within outbreaks (with exceptions [43] ) sequence data are often trivial to combine. More than that, including sequence data from previous studies can reciprocally contextualise both older and newer sequences (e.g. [44] ). What remains problematic is determining and standardising additional data pertaining to the sequences themselves (\""metadata\"") in a way that makes sequence data easy to use by other groups. Whilst date and location of collection are widely reported and often of most interest non-standard encodings of both are seen in public databases."", ""Stating the obvious"": ""As phylodynamic approaches are increasingly being applied to non-viral organisms it is important to set a good example of best data generation and analysis strategies. Sequencing complete bacterial genomes should lead to temporal resolution values comparable to those of viruses. For example Enterococcus faecium, evolving at a reported genomic evolutionary rate of 9.35 \u00d7 10 \u22126 substitutions per site per year [45] and with a genome length of around 3.2Mb, is expected to experience at least one mutation in its genome every 1 9.35\u00d710 \u22126 \u00d73.2\u00d710 6 \u00d7365 days = 12.2 days. These values are 4.41 years for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (evolutionary rate 5.67 \u00d7 10 \u22128 subs/site/year [45] and a genome 4Mbp long) and 53.6 days for Staphylococcus aureus (evolutionary rate 2.43 \u00d7 10 \u22126 subs/site/year [45] and a genome 2.8Mbp long) though care should be taken with evolutionary rate estimates as these are often reported per variable sites instead of genomic sites. Recombination is also a common though not universal concern when it comes to bacterial phylodynamics.We have shown that a relatively simple model of sequence differentiation (Eq. 2) exhibits good correspondence with empirical results (Fig. 2) and can be used as a back-of-the-envelope calculation to gauge the power of a phylodynamic analysis. The relationship defined by Eq. 2 also describes a serious drawback of using partial genomes, namely that maintaining the same temporal resolution with decreasing fractions of the total sites available in a genome requires the remaining sites to evolve at increasingly unrealistic rates. This relationship is reciprocal such that for a 90% reduction in alignment length a 10-fold increase in evolutionary rate is required to achieve the same temporal resolution when compared to a complete genome. It is not at all surprising then that reducing the number of alignment columns by nearly 90% from \u224819,000 nucleotides that comprise the entire Ebola virus genome down to around 2,000 nt of the GP gene results in severe loss of information even if this shorter region evolves at a faster rate. Here we have quantified this loss of information via several methods: raw phylogenetic resolution (Fig. 1) , molecular clock signal (Fig. 2) , and aspects of migration model (Figs. 3, 4, and 5) , which are summarised in Additional file 8.In most cases biological aspects of the data such as precise branching order and molecular clock resolution suffer from severe loss in temporal resolution (Fig. 2) whereas modelling of non-biological aspects of the data, i.e. migration, tend to be more robust (Figs. 3 and 5) . This is very likely to be caused by temporal and geographic rather than genetic features of the sequence data [46] . A clustering of sequences from a particular location collected over a short period of time is likely to be a genuine outbreak cluster within a wider epidemic and in the absence of genetic information phylogeographic models tend to group sequences by location. This might explain why in many cases when comparing analysis results between genome and GP datasets statistical power in migration model remains disproportionately high despite retaining only 10% of available sites and mutations and results between the entire >1600 genome data set [11] are very similar to the reduced data set analysed here. On a similar note case numbers alone have been used to recover a gravity-like model for the spread of Ebola virus in West Africa [47] previously, further arguing that the clustering of cases in time and space contains sufficient information about the movement of Ebola virus in West Africa. The overall conclusion from our study as well as others [17] is that sequencing short genomic regions instead of whole genomes is an ill-advised practice for investigating infectious disease outbreaks in any appreciable detail across relatively short timescales."", ""Sequence data"": ""A publicly available dataset of 1610 Ebola virus genomes sequenced by various groups [19, 20, 33, [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] and systematised in [11] was filtered to remove sequences where over 1% of the genome sequence was ambiguous or the precise location down to administrative division was not available leaving 943 genomes. A set of 600 viral genomes were randomly sampled from the filtered dataset of 943 high quality genomes. Of the 600 genomes that were chosen for analysis 10% (60 genomes) were chosen for masking where for all subsequent analyses both the date and location were considered as unknown and inferred as latent variables. Date inference was constrained via a uniform prior bounded by 2013 December 01 and 2015 December 01 corresponding roughly to the presumed beginning of the epidemic in late 2013 and its end in autumn of 2015. Another dataset was generated by extracting the glycoprotein GP coding sequence (with padding inserted into the polymerase slippage site to bring it in-frame) from the complete genomes dataset resulting in an alignment 2031 nucleotides long."", ""Bayesian analyses"": ""Both GP and genome datasets were analysed in BEAST v1.8.10 [56] under the generalised linear model (GLM) described previously [3, 10, 11] to infer the migration model. Sites in both GP and genome alignments were partitioned into codon positions 1, 2, and 3, with the genome analysis also including a partition comprised of noncoding intergenic regions. Each partition was assigned an independent HKY+ 4 [57, 58] substitution model. A relaxed molecular clock [59] with an uninformative CTMC reference prior on the mean [60] of the log-normal distribution was used as the clock model. A flexible skygrid tree prior [61] was used to infer estimates of effective population size across 100 evenly spaced points in time starting 1.5 years prior to the collection of the most recent sequence to the date of the most recent sequence.Both analyses (genome and GP) were set to run for 500 million states sampling every 50,000 states and run three (genome) or seven (GP) times independently. Due to technical issues with computational resources many analyses were not able to run to completion and so for full genomes only 136.5, 86.2, and 143.8 million states were sampled though after combining independent chains effective sample size (ESS) values are nearly the recommended 200. With the worst ESS values being prior (78) and precision (87) of GLM random effects, tree height (123), and prior (192), though largely as a result of bad mixing rather than convergence to different posteriors. Inference of masked tip dates often had poor ESSs as well mostly because of bad mixing and one example where all three chains independently sampled from two posterior distributions.Similarly for GP only two MCMC analyses ran their allotted 500 million states with others running to 259.9, 253.9, 255.8, 261.65, and 261.5 million states. Unlike complete genome MCMC analyses GP analyses exhibit relatively poor ESS values even after combining seven independent chains which is indicative of bad mixing in the absence of additional data contained in complete genome sequences and uninformative priors. Poor ESS values amongst re-inferred tip dates are even more prevalent when using GP data and are primarily caused by both convergence of independent chains onto different stationary distributions and individual chains sampling distinct distributions. Worst ESSs for other parameters were: likelihoods for the three codon positions (48, 31, and 48 for positions 1, 2 and 3, respectively), overall likelihood (60), joint/posterior (98), coefficient of variation (104), standard deviation of lognormal distribution from which branch rates are drawn (107), alpha parameter of gamma distribution used to model rate heterogeneity across second codon positions (155), tree prior (166), overall prior (177), and effective population size estimate at the earliest grid point (190) .Convergence, mixing and appropriate burn-in values were assessed with Tracer v.1.7 [62] where 50 million states from every analysis (genome and GP) was discarded as burnin with GP data additionally subsampled down to a quarter of the sampled states. Log files of analyses are available on GitHub at https://github.com/blab/genomichorizon/blob/master/data/xml/logs.zip and traces for posterior, prior and their product (called posterior) probabilities are shown in Additional file 9.Posterior distributions of inferred tip dates for the masked set were logged during MCMC and 95% highest posterior density intervals were computed using a custom Python script due to multi-peaked posterior distributions after combining independent analyses. Briefly, the script takes a kernel density estimate of posterior samples and computes the integral of the peaks intersected by a horizontal line that is lowered until the integral of the peaks intersected encompasses 0.95 of the area. Posterior distributions of trees were summarised as maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees using TreeAnnotator [56] . Inferred posterior probabilities of masked tip locations were recovered from MCC trees. Ancestral location probabilities were recovered via a script called samogitia.py with the 'ancestry' option (available at https://github.com/blab/genomic-horizon/blob/ master/scripts/samogitia.py) across 200 equally spaced time points between mid-2013 and beginning of 2016. The script samogitia.py uses baltic (available at https://github. com/evogytis/baltic) to parse posterior MCMC trees generated by BEAST."", ""Maximum likelihood analyses"": ""RAxML [63] was used to infer maximum likelihood phylogenies for genome and GP datasets under the same partitioning as described for Bayesian analyses: three codon position partitions for GP and genome with genomes having an additional partition for intergenic regions under independent GTR+CAT substitution models. Trees were rooted in TreeTime according to best r 2 value for rootto-tip against collection date regression with the 2 year constraint used for masked tips described earlier. A temporal phylogeny with marginal reconstruction of most likely dates for masked tips was carried out in TreeTime [64] as well. Ancestral sequences at internal nodes of the clock-rooted RAxML topology were inferred using Tree-Time under an HKY model [57] of evolution. Ancestral location states were inferred in TreeTime using a continuous time Markov chain model identical to the one used by [2] without the Bayesian stochastic search variable selection. We also repeated many of the analyses under a maximum likelihood model in TreeTime [64] like inference of masked tip dates (Additional file 4) and locations (Additional file 5)."", ""Error computation"": ""For Fig. 2 mean absolute errors were computed asWhere N is the number of masked tips, t i is the true date of the ith masked tip, e i is the estimated date of the ith masked tip, and M is the number of states sampled from the posterior distribution.For Fig. 3 errors expressed in units of distance were calculated asWhere N is the number of masked tips, J is the number of locations in the migration model, is great circle distance in kilometres, t i is the coordinate of the population centroid of the true location of the ith masked tip, e j is the coordinate of the population centroid of jth location, and p ij is the probability that the ith tip is in jth location.Entropies for predictors shown in Fig. 5 and location probabilities in Additional file 7 were calculated aswhere P i is the mean posterior inclusion probability of ith predictor matrix in the model for Figure 5 and probability of ith location for Additional file 7. Cross entropies for Fig. 3 were calculated aswhere N is the number of masked tips, q i is the probability of the true location of the ith masked tip, which is assigned a probability of 0.0001 if the true location does not appear in the set of inferred possible locations (i.e. has probability 0.0) to avoid domain error.""}",The ability of single genes vs full genomes to resolve time and space in outbreak analysis,"BACKGROUND: Inexpensive pathogen genome sequencing has had a transformative effect on the field of phylodynamics, where ever increasing volumes of data have promised real-time insight into outbreaks of infectious disease. As well as the sheer volume of pathogen isolates being sequenced, the sequencing of whole pathogen genomes, rather than select loci, has allowed phylogenetic analyses to be carried out at finer time scales, often approaching serial intervals for infections caused by rapidly evolving RNA viruses. Despite its utility, whole genome sequencing of pathogens has not been adopted universally and targeted sequencing of loci is common in some pathogen-specific fields. RESULTS: In this study we highlighted the utility of sequencing whole genomes of pathogens by re-analysing a well-characterised collection of Ebola virus sequences in the form of complete viral genomes (≈19 kb long) or the rapidly evolving glycoprotein (GP, ≈2 kb long) gene. We have quantified changes in phylogenetic, temporal, and spatial inference resolution as a result of this reduction in data and compared these to theoretical expectations.

When a C t cutoff of 40 for RT-qPCR was used, 35 samples were deemed to be positive by mOTNRT-PCR assay but negative by RT-qPCR (Table 3 and Figure 1) .

Neurologic failure is an important sign which may herald a treatable underlying disease. It is related to many factors: changes in infl ammatory and immune signaling, hypoxia, circulatory shock, infection, endocrine changes, metabolic changes, and medications. Acquired neurologic disorders such as delirium and ICU-acquired weakness are independently associated with adverse short-term outcome. Cognitive impairment and neuromuscular weakness are prevalent in survivors of critical illnesses in particular ARDS and sepsis. Given this chronicity, neurologic expressions of critical illness may be viewed as distinct disorders with selfsustaining biological mechanisms rather than dependent processes which resolve with remission of the inciting illness. Management should be directed to underlying mechanisms as well as symptoms."", ""Altered Mental Status"": ""The term \""altered mental status\"" refers broadly to any change in the overall level of conscious awareness. The level of consciousness is described as a clinical spectrum ranging from hyperalert to unresponsive, with intermediate states that include delirium, lethargy, obtundation, stupor, and coma. Severe brain injury may evolve toward chronic disorders such as the vegetative and minimally conscious states. Consciousness may be viewed in terms of two separate dimensions: the level of wakefulness and the level of awareness. Wakefulness and awareness are often covariable but may be unlinked as in the vegetative state."", ""Delirium"": ""Delirium is an acute confusional state developing in the setting of systemic disease. Cardinal features are an acute alteration in mental status with inattention, disorganized thinking, and a fl uctuating course. Delirium presents in two motoric subtypes, the more prevalent hypoactive delirium and the more easily recognized hyperactive form. Hyperactive delirium is readily identifi ed, while the hypoactive form may be overlooked and untreated. The incidence of delirium is very high, up to 80 % of mechanically ventilated patients [ 1 ] and 30-40 % of less severe patients in the ICU [ 2 ] . In recent years, the signifi cance of delirium has been recognized beyond the immediate safety of the patient, as delirium in the ICU has been shown to be predictive of mortality [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] , prolonged ICU stay [ 5 ] , increased cost [ 6 ] , and long-term cognitive impairment [ 7 , 8 ] .Different screening and assessment tools have been developed for identifying and rating patients with delirium in the ICU. The Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) [ 9 , 10 ] generates a binary result with patients categorized as either having or not having delirium; the tool may be implemented by the bedside nurse along with other routine clinical assessments. When compared with standard identifi ers, the sensitivity and specifi city of CAM-ICU is good (81 and 96 %) , and the inter-rater reliability is high (kappa 0.79) [ 11 ] . CAM-ICU does not assess the type or severity of delirium; however, the burden of delirium can be quantifi ed by estimating the time a patient is in delirium ( Fig. 21.1 ) [ 12 ] . The Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) [ 13 ] assigns a numerical score based on the presence or absence of eight characteristics. The ICSDC can be used to identify patients with incomplete presentations who may be at risk for delirium (subsyndromal delirium).The pathogenesis of delirium in the ICU is believed to refl ect a multifactorial process. Patients receive sedative and pain medication and may have sepsis or fever, sleep deprivation, weakness, lethargy, and a host of metabolic derangements [ 14 ] . Risk factors for delirium in the ICU include hypertension [ 2 , 15 ] , alcoholism [ 2 , 15 ] , dementia, isolation from social contact [ 14 ] , and environmental factors such as the absence of a window [ 15 ] . Dementia is both a predisposing factor [ 14 , 16 ] and a differential diagnosis. Age, a risk factor in the general medical population, is not associated with delirium in the ICU [ 2 , 14 ] . Delirium must also be differentiated from alcohol and substance withdrawal states which have distinct biological mechanisms and treatment implications.The management of delirium should be driven by a methodical consideration of inciting mechanisms. Specifi c strategies include pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions and should target all psychomotor types of delirium. Medications that could worsen delirium should be minimized. Benzodiazepines should be avoided whenever possible as they have been shown to increase the likelihood of delirium [ 17 , 18 ] . Medications with anticholinergic side effects, and especially any anticholinergic drug known to cross the blood-brain barrier such as atropine, should be avoided. Sedation protocols and daily interruptions of sedation should be implemented to decrease the exposure to deliriogenic medications and lessen the impact of delirium. Pharmacologic treatment centers on the use of antipsychotic medication both for confusional states and as a mild sedative. Neuroleptic medications such as haloperidol and more recently atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine and olanzapine have found frequent use in ICU-associated delirium [ 19 -23 ] . These medications work particularly well against agitated symptoms of delirium, but may also be theoretically benefi cial in hypoactive delirium analogously to their benefi ts against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. A randomized controlled trial may help determine if antipsychotics are in fact effi cacious for hypoactive delirium [ 20 ] .Non-pharmacologic management includes removal of unnecessary catheters and devices, noise reduction, measures to promote sleep [ 24 ] (see section on sleep disorders in this chapter), and reorientation strategies. Patients benefi t from the presence of calendars and clocks and from reassuring contact with family and ICU staff. Familiar items from "", ""Number of Errors >2 \u2192"": ""Errors are counted when patient fails to squeeze on the letter \""A\"" and when the patient squeezes on any letter other than \""A.\"" Errors are counted when the patient incorrectly answers a question."", ""Command"": ""Say to patient: \""Hold up this many fingers\"" (Hold 2 fingers in front of patient) \""Now do the same thing with the other hand\"" (Do not repeat number of fingers) *If pt is unable to move both arms, for 2nd part of command ask patient to \""Add one more finger\"" An error is counted if patient is unable to complete the entire command. home and pictures may also be benefi cial. Continuing routines from daily life such as reading newspapers, morning and evening routines, engaging in conversation, and being able to see outside a window are other examples of nonpharmacologic interventions."", ""Coma"": ""Coma is characterized by loss of alertness and awareness and is demonstrated by unresponsiveness to stimuli. Historical gradations of decreasing arousal include hypersomnolence, lethargy (patient is diffi cult to arouse), obtundation (incomplete arousal), stupor (no sustained arousal from sleeplike state), and fi nally coma (lack of arousal). Coma may occur secondary to any number of neurologic injuries, but it may also develop in the setting of a severe metabolic or physiologic disturbance.The biological origin of coma is understood by the study of (1) ascending brainstem arousal systems and their projections in the diencephalon, basal forebrain, and neocortex ( Fig. 21. 2 ) [ 25 ] , and (2) thalamocortical integrative systems responsible for higher-order awareness and cognition. The arousal system maintains alertness (wakefulness, vigilance) and serves as a gating mechanism for sensory inputs. It originates from the tegmental sections of the rostral pons and the midbrain. Two large branches ascend: one through the lateral hypothalamus and another through the thalamus. Neurotransmitters involved in these pathways are predominantly:1. Noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus with diffuse cortical projections 2. Histaminergic neurons prominent in the lateral hypothalamus 3. Cholinergic neurons in the dorsal pons with diffuse ascending and descending projections, but notably connections to the thalamus that are thought to regulate sleep and wakefulness 4. A more recently characterized orexin system located in the hypothalamus and responsible for modulating arousal pathways Coma may result from injury or impairment at all levels of the arousal/awareness system (Table 21 .1 ) [ 26 ] . Discrete lesions in the dorsal and paramedian midbrain or pons may cause coma. Injury to either of the main branches through the lateral hypothalamus or through the thalamus will independently cause coma, just as a bihemispheric or diffuse cortical process. Drugs, toxins, or metabolic factors that interfere with these pathways may cause coma (Table 21. 2 ) [ 27 ] .Coma caused by brainstem lesions are generally neurologic emergencies requiring swift decisive intervention (Table 21. 3 ) [ 26 ] . Diffuse cortical causes of coma may be more slowly evolving, although they should be met with prompt initiation of treatment as well. Localization is aided by the testing of cranial nerves whose nuclei are in proximity to arousal systems. Pupillary fi ndings may be characteristic, such as the pinpoint pupils seen in pontine lesions. Extraocular movements are controlled by pathways adjacent to the ascending arousal system, and vestibuloocular and oculocephalic refl exes may be helpful. Well-defi ned respiratory patterns may be associated with injury at different levels of the brainstem. Cheyne-Stokes respirations are linked with lesions above the midbrain, tachypnea with midbrain lesions, apneusis (breath holding at full inspiration) with rostral pontine lesions, and irregular ataxic breathing with lesions in the lower pons and upper medulla.Coma is assessed by evaluating the response to graded stimulus. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) assesses motor, verbal, and eye responses and is a powerful predictor of outcome in critically ill patients. The Full Outline of Unresponsiveness (FOUR) score [ 28 ] provides a quantitative [ 26 ] measure of breathing patterns, pupillary responses, and the response to stimulus by motor response and eye opening (Table 21 .4 ). The FOUR score provides more detailed information on brainstem function than the GCS; however, its prognostic value has not been shown to be superior.Resolution of coma does not always result in return to consciousness. The persistent vegetative state is seen when signs of arousal (e.g., spontaneous eye opening) return, but there is no awareness of self or of the environment. The minimally conscious state is a state of severely impaired consciousness characterized by inconsistently appearing, but unequivocal, signs of conscious awareness (e.g., tracking of objects, simple phonation or speech, but without evidence of reliable communication)."", ""Seizures and Status Epilepticus"": ""New-onset seizures are uncommon but can occur due to alcohol or substance withdrawal or severe metabolic disturbance (Table 21 .5 ) [ 29 ] . Nonconvulsive status seizures or status epilepticus may produce alteration of mental status and coma. Studies indicate that as many as 20 % of critically ill patients with coma have nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) [ 30 ] . Nonconvulsive status most often follows a clearly defi ned seizure and usually occurs in the setting of anoxic-ischemic damage, traumatic brain injury, withdrawal from sedatives or antiepileptics, or sepsis. In patients at risk (i.e., history of seizures, known primary brain injury, sepsis), continuous EEG monitoring for at least 24 h should be considered. Treatment is the same as for convulsive seizures or status. "", ""Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome"": ""Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), also known as posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome, is characterized by headache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual disturbances (even cortical blindness) associated with CT or MRI evidence of vasogenic edema usually in the parietal and occipital lobes. This condition is associated with severe hypertension, immunosuppressive drugs, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (eclampsia or preeclampsia). Though the exact pathophysiology is unknown, prevailing theories point toward a disturbance of autoregulatory mechanisms in the cerebral vasculature leading to endothelial injury, blood-brain barrier breakdown, and vasogenic edema [ 31 , 32 ] . MRI is more sensitive and specifi c for making this diagnosis than CT. Treatment should be targeted toward the underlying cause, blood pressure management, and seizure prophylaxis. Long-term prognosis with this condition is generally very good. Resolution of clinical and radiologic fi ndings occurs over days to weeks in the majority of cases."", ""Sleep Disorders and Sleep Deprivation"": ""Normal patterns of sleep and wakefulness are compromised in the ICU setting. The sickness behavior linked to acute infection (discussion to come) induces daytime hypersomnolence and disruptions in sleep. Pain is common among various critical illness states and may prevent rest at night. Delirium is common in the critically ill, and agitated delirium may keep patients in an animated state, initiating a vicious cycle of sleep deprivation and agitated delirium. Critical illness and the ICU environment are associated with a high likelihood of sleep disruption and deprivation [ 33 -38 ] . Patients are subject to procedures and assessments around the clock, and persistent lighting and noise may remove important cues driving circadian regulation. Noise is a major contributor to sleep impairment in the ICU due to physiologic alarms, overhead paging systems, staff conversations, and radio or television. Mechanical ventilation and patient-ventilator dyssynchrony in particular may disrupt sleep. Assist-control ventilation has been shown to be superior to pressure-support modes if nocturnal hyperventilation results in central apneas and arousals [ 39 ] . Further, proportional assist ventilation (PAV) may be superior to pressure support at night, an effect attributed to improved ventilator tolerance and synchrony [ 40 ] ; additionally, PAV also avoids nocturnal hyperventilation. Medications, including stimulants and catecholamine agents, may decrease sleep. Benzodiazepine sedation may decrease REM sleep and the restorative effect of sleep. Continuous polysomnography [ 41 ] studies have documented the marked fragmentation of sleep in the intensive care setting; patients with fragmented sleep spend less time in deeper stages of sleep. With frequent interruptions, the effi ciency of sleep decreases, resulting in lower quality of sleep, although the total time spent in sleep over a 24-h period may be similar to controls.Sleep deprivation has many detrimental consequences. Cognitive function declines, and eventually delirium is induced. Agitation and irritability are common, eventually hallucinosis may occur. Animal studies of prolonged sleep deprivation and of selective REM deprivation seem to indicate that, if carried out indefi nitely; total sleep deprivation will be uniformly fatal. The cause for the mortality related to sleep deprivation is not clear. Sleep deprivation alters immune function, but not in a predictable way. Animals may be more likely to survive infl uenza when sleep deprived, but bacterial sepsis becomes increasingly fatal. Sleep deprivation alters metabolism, animals markedly increase caloric intake, but still experience cachexia over time. There is negative nitrogen balance and an overall catabolic state. Sleep deprivation is a stressor, but the effects of sleep deprivation can be distinguished from stress [ 42 ] .Management of sleep disturbance in the ICU should target environmental modifi cation. Sedative agents may be helpful in the short term but are unlikely to have the restorative properties of natural sleep [ 43 -47 ] ."", ""Long-Term Cognitive Impairment Following Critical Illness"": ""Long-term impairments in cognition occur with signifi cant frequency among the survivors of critical illness [ 48 -50 ] . Memory and executive function, attention, processing speed, intellectual function, and visual-spatial testing are frequently Reproduced with permission from Wijdicks and Sharbrough [ 29 ] affected [ 49 ] . Reported rates of cognitive dysfunction at the time of discharge are similar to the rates of ICU delirium. One recent cohort by Girard showed evidence of cognitive impairment in 79 % of ICU survivors at 3 months and 71 % at 1 year, with severe cognitive impairment at 1 year in 36 % of subjects [ 8 ] . The rate of cognitive impairment was higher than in other reports perhaps because it included an older sample (median age 61 years), which is consistent with the adult ICU population in the United States. Acute delirium in hospitalized patients is linked to longterm neurocognitive dysfunction [ 51 ] . It has been observed that the natural history of dementia may be accelerated by an intervening period of critical illness [ 52 ] . Surprisingly, the severity of critical illness does not appear to correlate with the likelihood of long-term cognitive dysfunction [ 53 -55 ] , although length of stay did correlate with cognitive dysfunction in non-delirious patients immediately following the acute illness [ 56 ] . The normal decline with aging may not have been fully accounted for in all longitudinal cohort studies involving the elderly after ICU admission [ 57 ] .Cognitive assessments may be confounded by covariables present in survivors of critical illness: sleep deprivation and recovery can have persisting effects months after ICU discharge. Generalized weakness and fatigue are common in the survivors of critical illness, and the methods of testing in these studies were often modifi ed in order to accommodate the fatigue commonly present in the ICU survivors. Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder are common in ICU survivors and can confound neuropsychological performance.Long-term cognitive outcomes are important in that they can predict functional outcome after the illness. Older, previously high-functioning patients may need institutionalization or other costly care [ 49 ] . Younger patients have a low return to full employment rate (49 and 65 % of previously employed returned to their previous employment at 1 and 2 years, respectively) and lower quality-of-life scores after critical illness [ 58 ] . These factors represent an increased personal and societal burden of critical illness whose magnitude is only beginning to be appreciated."", ""ICU-Acquired Weakness"": ""There are many causes of severe muscle weakness that can occur in critically ill patients (Table 21 .6 ) [ 59 ] . Preexisting conditions that cause weakness may be exacerbated in the critically ill. The etiologies may be broken down anatomically: cortical lesions, brainstem lesions, myelopathies, anterior horn disease, polyneuropathies, neuromuscular junction disorders, and intrinsic myopathies.If there is no plausible etiology for severe weakness other than the underlying critical illness, then a diagnosis of ICUacquired weakness (ICU-AW) should be considered [ 60 -75 ] .ICU-AW is an umbrella term which includes critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), critical illness myopathy (CIM), and the overlap condition critical illness neuromyopathy (CINM). As many as 50 % of patients with sepsis, multiorgan failure, or prolonged mechanical ventilation demonstrate evidence of ICU-AW [ 76 ] . Factors associated with ICU-AW include sepsis, systemic infl ammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiple-system organ failure, renal replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation, catecholamine administration, and poor glycemic control. Exposure to glucocorticoids and the use of neuromuscular blockers (NMBA) in the ICU were implicated in ICU-AW, but have shown inconsistent association with ICU-AW in recent systematic review [ 75 ] . The weakness of ICU-AW is generalized and symmetric. Distal extremity strength such as grip strength may be affected earlier than proximal muscles. Decreased tone is common, and deep tendon refl exes are generally normal to decreased. Weakness may affect the diaphragm leading to prolonged respiratory failure, but facial involvement is rare, as facial grimace is generally preserved. Quantifi cation of the degree of impairment should be done for initial diagnosis and following the progress of disease. The recommended measure of global weakness is the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score (Table 21 .7 ). The MRC score grades strength in a functional muscle group from 0 to 5. The sum score is generated when three muscle groups are tested from each extremity giving a maximum score of 60. ICU-AW is considered with MRC sum score < 48, severe weakness < 36. The test is repeatable and not costly to perform. Patients must be awake and cooperative for this assessment, and distal extremity strength is not tested.ICU-AW was initially described by comparison to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 remains an important differential diagnosis because it can be treated with plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin. Distinguishing features of GBS, in addition to a consistent history and clinical onset, are the greater involvement of cranial nerves (generally absent in ICU-AW), the existence of dysautonomia, and elevated cerebrospinal fl uid protein.EMG and nerve conduction studies are recommended in cases of diagnostic uncertainty, if weakness is severe or if there is no improvement in neuromuscular function over the course of hospitalization. In cooperative patients capable of voluntary muscle contraction, nerve conduction studies and electromyography can distinguish CIP from CIM. When voluntary contraction cannot be obtained, direct muscle stimulation and muscle biopsy may be helpful if a severe underlying myopathy is suspected. Prolonged paralysis after neuromuscular-blocking agents (NMBA) may exist as another subcategory of ICU-AW, generally occurring in the setting of concurrent multiorgan failure [ 76 ] .ICU-AW is associated with prolongation of mechanical ventilation [ 62 , 65 ] and higher in-hospital mortality [ 64 , 69 ] , longer ICU stays, longer hospital stays, and greater associated costs. Long-term effects of ICU-AW include persistent weakness up to 1 year after ICU discharge [ 67 ] . While specifi c therapies for ICU-AW do not exist, efforts to mitigate or prevent it are centered on early physical therapy and occupational therapy [ 74 ] . The solution often involves culture change in the intensive care environment to allow early mobilization of patients."", ""Sedatives"": ""Benzodiazepines and other GABA-ergic agents such as propofol are commonly used in critically ill patients needing sedation for mechanical ventilation or other procedures. Benzodiazepines are, however, associated with a signifi cant risk of developing delirium, and there is interest in alternative sedative regimens. Dexmedetomidine in particular has been associated with a lower likelihood of delirium than benzodiazepines [ 77 , 78 ] ."", ""Antibiotics"": ""Several broad-spectrum antibiotics including fl uoroquinolones, cefepime, and piperacillin have been linked with encephalopathy, while imipenem has been associated with seizures and metronidazole with peripheral neuropathy. The aminoglycosides induce ototoxicity and impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction. Vancomycin also has an association with ototoxicity. The determination of whether an encephalopathy is related to an infection or the drug used to treat it may be diffi cult to make and may complicate management of CNS infections. Ascribing neurologic effects to antibiotic therapy should be a diagnosis of exclusion."", ""Immune Suppressants"": ""The deleterious effects of steroids on central and peripheral neurologic function are well known and include agitation, delirium and psychosis, and ICU-AW. There is a sizable Active movement with gravity eliminated 3Active movement against gravity 4Active movement against gravity and resistance 5Normal powerFor MRC sum score, grade 4 limbs, 3 muscle groups in each limb body of information on the neurologic side effects of immunosuppressive medications used in the setting of solid organ or hematological transplantation [ 79 -86 ] . Neurologic complications after liver transplantation are particularly common [ 79 , 86 ] , exacerbated by the requirement of many metabolites to be cleared via hepatic metabolism. Following liver transplantation, encephalopathy has been noted in up to 47 % of patients and seizures in 10 % [ 84 ] . The calcineurin inhibitors are a signifi cant cause of neurotoxicity. The choice of calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine versus tacrolimus) has no signifi cant impact on neurologic complication rates (17 versus 19 %) [ 84 ] . Cyclosporine neurotoxicity may appear in up to 60 % of patients receiving the drug and includes headache, amnesia, paresthesias, agitation, anxiety, insomnia, and tremor; more signifi cant fi ndings include decreased responsiveness, hallucinations, delusions, ataxia, aphasia, stroke-like fi ndings, cortical blindness, and seizures. Tacrolimus-associated neurologic manifestations are similarly varied. Symptoms include headache, confusion, myoclonus, seizures, visual disturbances, encephalopathy, and memory loss; hypertension is often induced. Toxicity can occur even with low trough levels, and the time to onset averages 15 days. Drug levels must be monitored closely immediately posttransplant as changes in renal function or volume of distribution can increase drug levels into neurotoxic range. The development of nephrotoxicity further elevates levels. Mycophenolate mofetil has a neurologic side effect profi le that is milder than the calcineurin inhibitors."", ""Neurological Implications of Organ Dysfunction Cardiovascular"": ""Cardiac and vascular causes of encephalopathy characteristically have an abrupt onset. Intracranial hemorrhages (aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage or primary intracerebral hemorrhage) or ischemic stroke may result in coma if lesions involve bilateral cerebral hemispheres, bilateral thalami, or if they are located in reticular activating system in the rostral brainstem. Focal strokes affecting the right parietal lobe and the basal ganglia have been associated with delirium. When a cerebrovascular etiology is likely, brain CT and/or MRI should be obtained emergently; consultation with neurology and/or neurosurgery is recommended.A probe-patent foramen ovale is present on 30 % of postmortem subjects but rarely has clinical signifi cance as normal left atrial pressures exceed right atrial pressures. This situation can be reversed in mechanically ventilated patients due to positive pressure ventilation and coughing secondary to airway stimulation, increasing the risk of paradoxical emboli. Neurosurgical patients in the seated operative position are theoretically at increased risk of paradoxical embolism, but the evidence is confl icting whether this occurs any more frequently in practice."", ""Endocarditis"": ""Manifestations of infective endocarditis (IE) are protean. The diagnosis is based upon evidence of cardiac vegetations and the presence of positive blood cultures [ 87 ] . Stroke risk correlates with the size of the vegetation and occurs in 30 % of patients with mitral valve endocarditis and in 10 % of patients with aortic valve endocarditis [ 88 -94 ] . The risk of cerebral embolism diminishes rapidly after initiation of intravenous antibiotic therapy. Neurologic sequelae are not infrequent after cerebral embolism, with meningitis occurring in 10.7 %, followed by intracranial hemorrhage (9.2 %) and intracranial abscess (7.7 %). Infective aneurysms may occur as a result of microemboli. Reported sites of aneurysms include the aorta, mesentery, and distal MCA. The cerebral aneurysms are usually silent and can, occasionally, regress; delayed rupture after 6 months is very rare. Rupture of an infective cerebral aneurysm may be seen in 0.6-4 %.The cornerstone of IE therapy is appropriately targeted antimicrobial therapy continued for 4-6 weeks. Early surgery [ 95 -97 ] should be considered if the patient develops heart failure or if there is severe or rapid degeneration of the infected valve, recurrent emboli, or development of a perivalvular abscess. Cardiac surgery may need to be deferred in patients with large-volume ischemic strokes or those with intracranial hemorrhage. Overall, the mortality is lower after high-risk valve surgery than with conservative management alone when a restrictive surgical selection is employed."", ""Cardiac Arrest"": ""Anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (AIE) is the most devastating consequence of cardiac arrest, with historically few survivors returning to their previous levels of neurologic functioning. The use of therapeutic moderate hypothermia has been associated with signifi cantly improved outcome following out-of-hospital ventricular fi brillation arrest [ 98 , 99 ] , and a recent prospective series indicates that a little more than one quarter of cardiac arrest survivors may gain functional independence in the long term [ 100 , 101 ] . Currently, it appears reasonable to extrapolate these fi ndings to comatose survivors of cardiac arrest in the inpatient setting. With greater implementation of hypothermia, existing prognostic models for post-cardiac arrest AIE [ 102 ] (anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy) have been seriously challenged [ 103 , 104 ] . Hypothermia has multiple side effects including cardiac dysrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, pneumonia, atelectasis, decreased clearance of sedatives, shivering if paralytic agents are not used, hyperglycemia and decreased insulin secretion, and cold diuresis and hypovolemia."", ""Hypertensive Crisis"": ""In a hypertensive emergency, the end organs most acutely affected are brain, heart, kidney, and large arteries. The most common complications are intracranial hemorrhage and pulmonary edema. Neurologic manifestations of hypertensive emergency are headache, nausea and vomiting, visual disturbances, confusion, and loss of consciousness. Hypertensive encephalopathy without hemorrhage may develop due to vasogenic edema and may be appreciable on neuroimaging as a specifi c subtype of PRES."", ""Altered Cerebral Autoregulation in Chronic Hypertension"": ""Autoregulation of the cerebral vasculature allows vascular tone to correct for fl uctuations in arterial blood pressure. Cerebral autoregulation is most protective of hypertensive fl uctuations, but will also allow maintenance of adequate cerebral blood fl ow (CBF) at low blood pressures, provided mean arterial pressures (MAP) exists between 50 and 150 mmHg. In chronic hypertension, the CBF-MAP relationship is shifted to accommodate for the elevated blood pressures, hence increasing the risk of cerebral ischemia at the arterial blood pressure which would be tolerated in normal subjects. It is therefore reasonable to target higher blood pressures in patients with chronic hypertension."", ""Hypoxia and Hypercapnia"": ""Neurologic manifestations of acute hypoxemia include agitation and delirium, progressing to seizures, myoclonus, obtundation, and coma when hypoxemia is of suffi cient magnitude or duration. After sudden prolonged or severe hypoxia, a global encephalopathy analogous to AIE may be seen. Incremental decreases in PaO 2 may be better tolerated, as seen in high-altitude mountaineers. Myoclonus is a nonspecifi c fi nding, but is common in hypoxic encephalopathy. Myoclonic status (persistent myoclonus for the majority of the day post-event) portends poor outcome in comatose patients [ 105 ] . Coma survivors with intermittent myoclonus may occasionally develop Lance-Adams intention myoclonus on awakening, which itself may be a debilitating chronic condition [ 100 , 106 ] .Neurologic manifestations of acute hypercapnia include somnolence, lethargy, and coma. Patients with chronic lung disease will have metabolically compensated hypercapnia with minimal neurologic expression. The cognitive impairment observed in patients with advanced COPD is likely refl ective of both hypoxia and hypercapnia. Cognitive impairment with hypercapnia appears to correlate most with the change in PaCO 2 from baseline, rather than the absolute value. In patients with baseline PaCO 2 of 40 mmHg, signifi cant neurological impairment occurs with a PaCO 2 in the range of 60-80 mmHg; in COPD patients, the noticeable effect will occur at a similar delta from their baseline. The effect of PaCO 2 of 90-100 mmHg in a baseline normocapnic patient may be equivalent to 1 MAC of anesthesia (roughly a normalized unit of full general anesthesia due to any agent)."", ""ALI/ARDS"": ""Nearly half of acute lung injury (ALI) survivors will have demonstrable long-term functional impairments [ 53 , 67 , 101 , 107 -110 ] . Survivors of ALI are at risk for signifi cant long-term neurocognitive impairments [ 53 , 107 ] . Cognitive sequelae in this population can derive from prolonged hypoxemia, hypotension, sepsis, and infl ammation; however, the exact underlying pathophysiology is not certain. Delirium may be an epiphenomenon indicating neurologically significant critical illness, as delirium correlates with long-term cognitive sequelae in the critically ill [ 8 ] and with mortality at 6 months [ 1 ] .Impaired neurocognitive performance following ALI has been documented in several studies by Hopkins and colleagues. Global cognitive impairment was noted in 30 % of patients who were assessed 1 year after acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and signifi cant impairment was noted in at least one domain of cognition in 55 % of study subjects [ 107 ] . In a follow-up study, signifi cant residual impairment in at least one domain of testing was observed in 47 % of patients at 2 years [ 53 ] . At 6 year follow-up, the incidence of neurocognitive defect may be decreased to 25 % of patients [ 110 ] .Studies using head CT have shown that ALI survivors may be at increased risk for brain atrophy when compared to age-matched controls [ 111 ] . Although CTs in many ALI patients were normal, there was a signifi cant increase in averaged brain atrophy as measured by volumetric ventricleto-brain ratio compared to controls. In the study, there was no control for the timing of the imaging, and many CTs were performed early in the course of illness (within the fi rst 2 weeks); the study failed to show correlation between degree of hypoxia and atrophy, although the pattern was similar to atrophy seen following AIE."", ""Sickness Behavior Syndrome"": ""The sickness behavior syndrome (SBS) is an adaptive and evolutionarily advantageous physiologic and behavioral response to a systemic infl ammatory state. Presenting signs include anorexia, fatigue, somnolence, social withdrawal, aching joints, fever, and chills. SBS is prominent in autoimmune disease and in sepsis, but may also play a role in malaise of other chronic conditions including heart failure, obesity, Alzheimer's, stroke, and depression [ 112 ] .There may be several signaling pathways involved in SBS, both humoral and neural. IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha play a prominent role. Pro-infl ammatory cytokines activate vagal afferents to the brainstem, with input to the hypothalamus and limbic system. By interacting with the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, IL-1 can cause fever via induction of prostaglandin E2 and cortisol release. Autoimmune diseases activate a pathway involving anti-self T lymphocytes, in which the T-cells bind to CD40+ on B-cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages to produce pro-infl ammatory cytokines that are independent of the pathway for SBS induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide [ 113 ] . Although SBS is adaptive in mammals to learn to avoid poisons in the wild and to recuperate during illness, in the ICU the effect is maladaptive and may delay resolution of illness and recovery."", ""Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy"": ""Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) [ 114 -122 ] is a disturbance of brain function arising in the setting of sepsis arising from a non-CNS source. It is characterized by alteration in mental status, diffuse slowing on EEG, typically a normal head CT, and normal CSF indicating absence of meningitis, all in the presence of systemic sepsis. In patients with bacteremia, 87 % had abnormal EEG and 70 % had neurologic symptoms ranging from lethargy to coma [ 114 ] . SAE is commonly viewed as a reversible condition; however, patients may develop long-lasting defi cits. Often, patients emerging from SAE are noted to have ICU-AW which may take longer to resolve. ICU-AW is noted in up to 70 % of patients with SAE [ 65 ] .Clinical presentation may be subtle. CNS dysfunction may be one of the earliest signs of infection and may allow for timely diagnostic evaluation and therapy. Early presenting signs of SAE include inattention and fl uctuating mental status consistent with acute delirium [ 114 ] . More severe SAE presents as coma. Motor manifestations may include velocity-dependent resistance to passive movement that diminishes as the limb is moved slowly (gegenhalten or paratonic rigidity) [ 114 ] but also asterixis, tremor, or myoclonus. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is very sensitive for sepsis-associated encephalopathy, even before clinically evident neurologic fi ndings appear. Routine use of EEG in septic patients has been suggested as a means of categorizing patients with SAE [ 115 ] . The EEG change follows a progression with severity of encephalopathy and correlates with mortality. Early changes include slowing of the dominant rhythm: the thetas (19 % mortality), deltas (36 % mortality), the appearance of generalized triphasic waves (50 % mortality), and burst suppression (67 % mortality) [ 115 ] . While CT fi ndings are generally unremarkable, MRI may reveal ischemic stroke or a pattern of leukoencephalopathy, which may represent breakdown of the blood-brain barrier [ 116 ] ; these fi ndings on MRI correlate with poor outcome [ 116 ] . CSF analysis is negative for infection, but elevated protein may be present. Serum biomarker S100B may be elevated in some patients but does not correlate with severity of illness [ 117 ] .The pathophysiology of SAE is not well understood. Elevated cytokine levels inhibit endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) resulting in vasoconstriction and impaired microcirculatory fl ow. Cerebral autoregulation is impaired in septic shock patients; thus, hypotension during septic shock may result in signifi cant decreases in CBF [ 120 ] . The endothelial dysfunction in sepsis also produces a procoagulant state, potentially contributing to microvascular infarcts [ 116 ] . Endotoxemia may cause impairment of blood-brain barrier, leading to vasogenic edema and altering brain homeostasis. There may also be an alteration in the ratio of amino acids transported across the BBB, as aromatic amino acids are more readily transported than branch-chained amino acids. There is some indication that addition of branch-chained amino acids may be of benefi t in the treatment of SAE [ 123 ] .Management of SAE is predicated on treatment of the underlying infection. Antibiotic therapy may not reverse the encephalopathy in all cases as more endotoxin may be initially released with antibiotic therapy, or a severe or irreversible injury may have already occurred. In addition to management of organ failure and metabolic disturbances, avoidance of neurotoxic drugs is recommended."", ""Liver Failure"": ""The liver contributes importantly to normal CNS function. The brain is dependent on glucose homeostasis, which is maintained with the aid of the liver. In addition, the liver is involved in intermediate steps of metabolism for many substrates used in the brain. Most importantly, the liver is essential in eliminating toxic metabolites that would modulate CNS function."", ""Acute Liver Failure"": ""Acute liver failure (ALF) is defi ned as the rapid development of encephalopathy and impaired synthetic function in a patient with previously normal liver function. The etiology is most commonly a toxic ingestion or viral hepatitis. Presenting symptoms are neurologic, often preceding any clinically evident jaundice. Mania, agitation, and delirium are common early fi ndings, along with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain; the neurologic features evolve rapidly to coma. Generalized seizures are common. Cerebral edema [ 124 , 125 ] is the principal consequence of ALF and has both cytotoxic and vasogenic components.The cornerstone of management is to identify liver transplant candidates and preserve neurologic function. Transplantation may increase ALF survival from 15-20 % to 60-80 % [ 126 , 127 ] . Admission to the ICU for aggressive management and rapid evaluation for transplantation are essential. ICP monitoring and ICP management with hypertonic saline or mannitol may allow treatment or prevention of brain herniation and irreversible neurologic injury. Medical management should include interventions to reduce serum ammonia, seizure prophylaxis, sedation, and induced hypothermia [ 124 , 128 ] ."", ""Hepatic Encephalopathy"": ""Chronic liver disease may produce encephalopathy with intermittent exacerbation. The encephalopathy is initiated by impaired clearance of metabolites from portosytemic shunting of blood in the setting of portal hypertension and, in late disease, loss of sustainable synthetic function due to cirrhosis; hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a clinical diagnosis [ 129 , 130 ] . The diagnosis can be supported by hyperammonemia, but severity does not always correlate well with blood ammonia levels. Clinical fi ndings include short-term memory loss, hypersomnia, insomnia, lethargy, asterixis, slurred speech, erratic behavior, and coma (Table 21 .8 ). Sensitive neuropsychiatric testing may be required to evaluate milder disease. Some patients may be functional in society at baseline.Acute decompensation is associated with gastrointestinal bleeding events, due to the concomitant esophageal varices seen with portal hypertension. Infections commonly precipitate deterioration as well, notably subacute bacterial peritonitis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. Renal failure, malnutrition from cachexia, overaggressive diuresis and hypoperfusion, and exogenous narcotics or benzodiazepines may contribute a second cause of encephalopathy and make the disease clinically evident. There may be worsening of portosystemic shunt as after portal vein thrombosis or after TIPS procedure. Lastly, there may be an additional hepatic insult such as superimposed viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, or drug-induced liver injury.EEG abnormalities in HE include -in order of worsening severity -theta rhythms, generalized triphasic waves, and predominant delta rhythm. The EEG may have characteristic high-amplitude low-frequency bursts. The most consistent laboratory fi nding is hypoalbuminemia and clotting factor deficiency. Other laboratory fi ndings are inconsistent, but in general elevated serum ammonia levels are expected. Ammonia levels should be taken fasting and preferably from arterial samples. Elevated ammonia levels may exert its effect indirectly by inducing astrocyte dysfunction, thus explaining the occasional unlinking of hyperammonemia and neurologic effects [ 124 ] . HE is associated with loss of regulation of cerebral blood fl ow, impaired oxygen metabolism, and conversion of astrocytes to Alzheimer type 2 cells [ 131 , 132 ] . A head CT should be performed to evaluate for brain edema and to rule out structural lesions. MRI is more sensitive and specifi c for cerebral edema and may demonstrate increased signal in bilateral basal ganglia on T1-weighted imaging.The treatment of acute exacerbations should identify and remove precipitating factors. Lactulose or other cathartics may aid in the elimination of protein metabolites. Enteral neomycin, metronidazole, or rifaximin can be very helpful in reducing the bacterial fl ora of the gut. Long-term management requires limitation of enteral protein to 0.5 g/kg/day and titration of lactulose to adequate stool frequency and abatement of neurologic symptoms."", ""Nutritional and Malabsorptive Disorders in the Critically Ill"": ""Nutritional disorders and malabsorptive disorders may occasionally produce neurologic symptoms in the ICU (Table 21.9 ). When present, defi ciency of water-soluble vitamins such as thiamine, ribofl avin, niacin, and pyridoxine is usually due to insuffi cient nutritional intake [ 133 ] . Defi ciency of fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin A, D, E, and K, can occur in the ICU in the setting of postsurgical short gut syndrome, pancreatic Reproduced with permission from Mancall [ 133 ] insuffi ciency, hepatic disease with bile acid defi ciency, colchicine, laxatives, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, or poorly controlled celiac disease [ 134 ] or Crohn's disease."", ""Wernicke's Encephalopathy"": ""Wernicke's encephalopathy is a rare and preventable condition caused by thiamine defi ciency. It is most commonly seen in patients with chronic alcoholism, cancer, and in late-stage AIDS. Clinical presentation includes ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, gait ataxia, and altered mental status. MRI may reveal T2-hyperintense lesions surrounding the cerebral aqueduct and third ventricle and in the mamillary bodies and medial thalami. Treatment is with intravenous thiamine. The administration of glucose to susceptible patients without prior thiamine supplementation can precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy or worsen existing disease. In any patient who is potentially at risk for Wernicke's encephalopathy, thiamine should be administered prior to giving any glucose containing solutions."", ""Encephalopathy of Renal Failure Uremic Encephalopathy"": ""Uremic encephalopathy can develop with both acute and chronic renal failure. Presenting symptoms include headache, tremor, myoclonus, obtundation, and coma. The cause of the neurologic dysfunction is thought to be due to accumulation of dialyzable toxins including urea, guanidino compounds, uric acid, hippuric acid, atypical amino acids, polyamines, phenols, acetone, glucuronic acid, carnitine, myoinositol, and phosphates. Uremic encephalopathy resolves with renal replacement therapy, yet a delay of 1-2 days is common before clinical improvement is seen."", ""Dialysis Disequilibrium Syndrome"": ""An acute neurologic complication that may occur with hemodialysis is dialysis disequilibrium syndrome (DDS). Symptoms include headache, nausea, confusion, and ataxia. Severely affected patients may develop seizures, obtundation, and coma. This condition usually develops during or immediately after hemodialysis and is thought to be caused by rapid changes in serum osmolality leading to brain edema. DDS is self-limiting and symptoms generally resolve over several hours."", ""Encephalopathy Associated with Endocrine Disorders"": ""Severe hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can cause an acute encephalopathy. Myxedema coma is the severest form of hypothyroidism and manifests with lethargy or coma in association with bradycardia, hypothermia, hyponatremia, and hypercapnic/hypoxemic respiratory failure. Thyrotoxicosis may present with a range of neurologic symptoms from psychosis and agitation to delirium, somnolence, and even coma. Acute adrenal insuffi ciency typically presents with circulatory shock and electrolyte abnormalities, yet it can also be associated with lethargy and coma. Hashimoto's encephalopathy -also known as steroid-responsive encephalopathy with autoimmune thyroiditis -is a heterogenous syndrome of neurologic symptoms associated with anti-thyroid antibodies and/or autoimmune thyroid dysfunction. Its presentation can range from subacute, recurrent episodes of focal neurologic defi cits to a rapidly progressive dementia or coma. Treatment is with corticosteroids."", ""Metabolic Encephalopathy"": ""Common electrolyte disturbances that result in encephalopathy are hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemic crises. Acute hyponatremia may cause brain edema with clinical signs ranging from confusion to coma and death [ 135 -140 ] . The severity of clinical presentation depends on the rate of decrease and the absolute serum sodium level. Correction of hyponatremia should be achieved in a controlled manner to avoid the development of an osmotic demyelination syndrome. Hypernatremia leads to neurologic dysfunction through a hyperosmolar state that effectively dehydrates the brain. The rate of correction of hypernatremia should also be cautious to prevent the development of cerebral edema. Hypoglycemia can present with encephalopathy or occasionally as focal neurologic defi cits, especially in patients with prior strokes or other brain lesions. Correction of hypoglycemia should be performed rapidly with intravenous dextrose to prevent permanent brain injury. Depending on the severity and duration of hypoglycemia, the clinical response to treatment may lag signifi cantly behind the return to normoglycemia. Severe hyperglycemia resulting from decompensated diabetes mellitus is another important cause of encephalopathy. Brain dysfunction results from serum hyperosmolarity associated with acidosis and electrolyte depletion. Treatment priorities are intravascular volume resuscitation, intravenous insulin, and electrolyte repletion."", ""Summary"": ""The neurologic expression of critical illness is prevalent and associated with adverse outcome. Both the central and the peripheral nervous system may be affected. Recognition may be delayed due to sedation and emphasis on systemic resuscitation. Intensive care providers must work systematically to identify and treat supervening neurologic disorders. Research is needed to discover biological mechanisms and implement preventive and therapeutic interventions.""}",Neurologic Implications of Critical Illness and Organ Dysfunction,"Critical illness has consequences for the nervous system. Patients experiencing critical illness are at risk for common global neurologic disturbances, such as delirium, long-term cognitive dysfunction, ICU-acquired weakness, sleep disturbances, recurrent seizures, and coma. In addition, complications related to specific organ dysfunction may be anticipated. Cardiovascular disease presents the possibility for CNS injury after cardiac arrest, sequelae of endocarditis, aberrancies of blood flow autoregulation, and malperfusion. Respiratory disease is known to cause short-term effects of hypoxia and long-term effects after ARDS. Sepsis encephalopathy and sickness behavior syndrome are early signs of infection in patients. In addition, commonly encountered organ dysfunction including uremia, hepatic failure, endocrine, and metabolic disturbances present with neurologic findings which may manifest in the critically ill patient as well.",10.1007/978-1-4471-5226-2_21,PMC,PMC7119948,,no-cc,2013-05-07,Textbook of Neurointensive Care,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119948/,2013.0,paper

[1] . The incidence of this complication is much less than in past (10-35%) andcurrently is about 5% of all patients with transmural MI. [2] . This is probably the result of the aggressive post-ischemic treatments, including percutaneous coronary intervention, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and other medical therapies for advanced heart failure. LVA is often associated with arrhythmia, poor ejection fraction and heart failure and, if left untreated, it is associated with poor survival at 5 years [3] . Several left ventricular reconstruction (LVR) techniques have been developed with the aim of restoring the left ventricular volume and shape and encouraging results have been reported [4] . Nevertheless, the number of these procedures has dramatically reduced in the last decade. Many factors such as early percutaneous treatment, surgical complexity and the poor long-term outcomes may have contributed to this decline. Most importantly, the Surgical Treatment of Ischemic Heart Failure (STICH) trial failed to show any improvement in survival or ventricular function of adding SVR to coronary arterial grafting in patients with LVEF <35% and dominant anterior asinergy, even though SVR achieved greater LV end systolic volume index reduction (19% vs 6%) [5] . A major criticism on this trial was the inadequate volume reduction, which left the patients in the two arms at the identical risk. In an insight of the STICH trial, Michler et al identified a 30% volume reduction threshold for better survival [6] . In the current issue of the Journal, Stefanelli et al add evidence on the importance of performing a LV volume reduction >35% for survival benefits [7] . Interestingly, better long terms results were reached in those patients receiving the modified SVR technique compared to the Dor one.According to authors, the preservation of left ventricular diastolic function without the use of circumference pure strings and pericardial patch as well as the restoration of the elliptic geometry represent the key of success of this procedure. Overall early mortality was 1.6%, much lower than others with an overall survival of 68% at 5 years, and 41% at 10 years [4] . Nevertheless, the small sample size (represented by few patients at risk in Kaplan Meyer curve) and the inclusion of mitral valve treatment (potential impact on survival), represent major limits. In addition, this is a single surgeon experience, which may not be reproducible in other hands. Despite these limits, authors present an excellent timing in publishing this paper. In my opinion, more SVR procedures will be performed in the next years. Data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic have shown an important reduction rate of hospital admission for acute coronary syndrome, especially after lockdown [8, 9] . It is likely that patients avoid cardiovascular evaluation out of the fear of contracting COVID-19 in hospitals. As consequence, LVA, ischemic mitral regurgitation and heart failure will surge in the next years. In conclusion, authors have demonstrated that LVA is safe and associated with early and long-term outcomes. Although the incidence of LVA have reduced over the time, in the next years more patients will be referred for SVR as indirect effect of COVID-19 for untreated myocardial infarction.

In this setting, the use of antibiotics is recommended by the recent guidelines of the European Respiratory Society (ERS), and French Consensus Conference [2, 3] . However, bacteria are isolated from the respiratory tract of only approximately 50% of patients with severe acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) [4] [5] [6] . Whether this finding represents colonization or infection is controversial [7] [8] [9] . In contrast, a high prevalence of respiratory viruses has been reported in severe AECOPD requiring ventilation [10, 11] .In this context, a rapid, specific test to identify lower respiratory bacterial infections would be a major advancement, limiting the inappropriate use of antibiotics which is considered to be a main cause of the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria [12, 13] . Serum procalcitonin levels are considered to be one of the best biomarkers for predicting a bacterial infection [14] . The level of circulating procalcitonin is increased in severe bacterial infections, but remains fairly low in viral infection and non specific inflammatory diseases [15, 16] . In addition, procalcitonin-based therapeutic strategies have been shown to substantially and safely reduce antibiotic use in patients with no severe lower respiratory tract infections [17] or acute exacerbation of COPD [18] . However, studies that specifically assess this marker in critically ill patients are scarce.The aim of the current study was to assess procalcitonin levels in, and their relationship with viruses and bacteria in respiratory samples from COPD patients admitted to the ICU for AECOPD."", ""Materials and methods"": ""Patients COPD patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection admitted to the medical intensive care unit of the University Hospital of Caen between September 2005 and September 2006 were assessed for eligibility. Only those with AECOPD were included in the analysis. Patients with the presence of infiltrates on chest radiographs taken at admission and suspected of pneumonia, or exhibiting evidence of other causes of respiratory failure, were not included in this study."", ""Definition"": ""We defined COPD according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Guidelines (GOLD) 2005 http://www.goldcopd.org as an FEV1/FVC ratio (forced expiratory volume in 1 second/functional vital capacity) of less than 70%, with severity categorized into mild (FEV1 \u2265 80% of predicted), moderate (FEV1 \u2265 50% to < 80%), severe (FEV1 \u2265 30% to < 50%) and very severe (FEV1 < 30%). An AECOPD was defined as \""a sustained worsening of patient's condition, from stable state and beyond normal day-to-day variations, that is acute in onset and necessitates a change in regular medication in a patient with underlying COPD\"" [19] .AECOPD was considered bacteriologically confirmed in the presence of a positive Gram stain of respiratory samples, a pathogen concentration greater than 10 5 cfu/mL in tracheobronchial aspirations, or a blood culture revealing a bacterial pathogen in the absence of an extrapulmonary focus [4] . A culture, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay positive for viruses was considered evidence for a viral pathogen."", ""Study design"": ""The protocol of this prospective cohort study was submitted to the local ethics committee. The ethical board decided that approval was not necessary given the observational nature of our study. Thus, according to French legislation at the time of the study, no informed consent was obtained from the patients. Upon admission to the ICU, baseline assessment included the severity of COPD according to GOLD criteria; home oxygen and home noninvasive ventilation treatment; chronic steroid therapy; comorbidities such as cigarette smoking, chronic alcohol abuse, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or chronic cardiovascular diseases; use of antibiotic therapy and oral steroids for exacerbations of COPD during the previous 30-day period; use of antibiotics within 24 hours of ICU admission; physical examination; chest radiography; and routine blood tests including c-reactive protein (CRP) at admission (CRP-H0) and 24 hours later (CRP-H24). In addition, scoring of disease severity the first day in ICU was assessed by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score type II (SAPS II) [20] , the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score [21] , and the Logistic Organ Dysfunction (LOD) score [22] . All patients were treated according to the recommendations of the French Consensus Conference [3] ."", ""Measurement of serum procalcitonin"": ""All blood samples were centrifuged, decanted, aliquoted, and frozen at -80\u00b0C until analyzed at the end of the study period. PCT was measured using a sensitive immunoassay (Kryptor PCT, Brahms, Hennigsdorf, Germany) with a functional assay sensitivity of 0.06 \u03bcg/L, about fourfold above mean normal levels [23] . The circulating levels of procalcitonin were sequentially assessed at ICU admission (PCT-H0), after six hours (PCT-H6), and twenty fours (PCT-H24) hours. Patients were classified into three groups based on the probability of bacterial infection according to the highest procalcitonin level measured (PCTmax), as previously reported [17, 18] : group1 PCT-max < 0.1 \u03bcg/L indicating an absence of infection, group 2 PCTmax > 0.1 and < 0.25 \u03bcg/L indicating a possible infection and group 3 PCTmax > 0.25 \u03bcg/L indicating the presence of infection."", ""Microbiological assessment"": ""Upon enrollment, spontaneously expectorated sputum samples or tracheal aspirates were obtained for Gram staining and cultures. Bacterial isolation and identification was performed with the use of standard techniques. Sputum or tracheal aspirates were bacteriologically processed if less than 1% of the observed field contained squamous epithelial cells and more than 25 neutrophils were observed [24] . A serological diagnostic for antibodies to Legionella pneumophila was also performed by indirect immunofluorescence, associated with a detection of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen in urine samples. In addition, nasal swab or tracheobronchial aspiration was performed in all patients and tested for viruses. Details of the viral detection methods including culture, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and molecular methods (PCR or RT-PCR), are published elsewhere [11, [25] [26] [27] . We tested for the following viruses: parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1,2,3, and 4; influenza virus A,B, and C; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); metapneumovirus (hMPV); rhinovirus (RV); coronavirus 229E and OC43; and, adenovirus (AdV).

Additionally, hemocultures and Legionella diagnostic tests were performed in 37 (95%) and 38 (97%) patients, respectively. According to our definition, 12 (31%) patients had AECOPD microbiologically confirmed. Five species of bacteria (4 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 Haemophilus influenzae) and 9 species of viruses (6 rhinovirus, 1 human metapneumovirus, 1 parainfluenza 1 and 1 parinfluenza 3) were detected.

There was no correlation between these findings and procalcitonin levels (data not shown). The mean length of ICU stay was 9 \u00b1 7 days. One patient developed a ventilator-associated pneumonia. He died of COPDrelated respiratory failure seven days after ICU discharge.

Thirty five patients were discharged from the hospital. Twelve of these patients (34%) were subsequently hospitalised for AECOPD within 6 months. PCT-H0 and PCTmax were not predictive of recurrence (data not shown). Four patients died, three of COPD-related respiratory failure and one of pneumothorax complicated with cardiac arrest. All had very severe COPD and a PCTmax > 0.25 \u03bcg/L. In univariate analysis, a PCT level > 0.25 \u03bcg/L was associated with mortality (4/10 vs 0/25 deaths among those with a PCT < 0.25 \u03bcg/L, P < 0.006)."", ""Discussion"": ""The present study reports procalcitonin levels in critically ill COPD patients admitted for AECOPD with severe conditions according to the Global Initiative for ChronicObstructive Lung Disease criteria. In agreement with previous reports [17, 18] , PCT levels (< 0.1 \u03bcg/L) could indicate an absence of infection in approximately 40% of patients. In this sub-group, no bacteria, were detected in systematic screening, except Pseudomonas aeruginosa in three patients known to be chronically colonized by this pathogen. These preliminary results may have important implications for investigating procalcitonin-based antibiotic strategies in severe AECOPD.Our findings differ from previous studies assessing the microbiological pattern of AECOPD [4, 6, 10, [28] [29] [30] , which reported a higher prevalence of bacteria, varying from 23% [10] to 72% [4] . Differences in inclusion criteria and diagnostic tests in an absence of respiratory samples for bacteria detection in a quarter of our patients may explain this difference.

According to Stolz et al. [18] , PCT levels were not different between patients pre-treated with antibiotics and antibiotic-naive patients, and no association was found between PCT levels and clinical symptoms or AECOPD bacteriologically confirmed. In addition, the proportion of patients with particular levels of PCT was in accordance with this previous report, suggesting that a large fraction of patients with low PCT levels (PCTmax < 0.1 \u03bcg/L) have a low likelihood of bacterial infection. In this sub-group, only one pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was detected in three patients known to be chronically colonized by this germ. Whether this finding represents colonization or infection remains controversial [7, 32, 34, 35] . This could explain why PCT measurements failed to identify 3 from 5 patients with AECOPD bacteriologically documented in our study. In one case, rhinovirus was isolated in association with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and was considered as the cause of exacerbation. Moreover, we reported that a lower respiratory tract viral infection did not significantly influence PCT levels in this setting. In addition, despite our small sample size, we were able to demonstrate a significant impact of PCT (PCT > 0.25 \u03bcg/L in this cohort) in predicting ICU mortality, as previously reported in studies focusing on septic shock [36] and ventilator-associated pneumonia [37] .Box-and-whisker plots representing PCT levels measured at various time This study had some limitations. The monocentric design of the study and, the relatively small sample size, as well as the fact that sputum could not be taken in 10 patients (25%) for bacteria detection, may limit the interpretation and relevance of our data. However, PCT assessment was performed in 90% of patients using technology recognized as the most sensitive, and our findings are consistent with those of previous studies [17, 18] . For this reason, we believe that this study adds useful information about PCT levels in severe AECOPD requiring an ICU stay and the likelihood of bacterial infection.The results reported here may have important implications for the design of a randomized controlled trial testing procalcitonin-based antibiotic strategies in severe AECOPD. It has been demonstrated antibiotics have a marginal efficacy in the treatment of AECOPD, except among patients with evidence of bacterial infection or severe exacerbation [38] . Less than 50% of severe AECOPD may be attributed to bacteria, suggesting the potential for excessive antibiotic use in this setting [39] . Therefore, serum procalcitonin level may be considered as a useful tool for predicting bacterial infection, and may prove useful for selecting patients with a lower probability of bacterial infection and limit the inappropriate use of antibiotics, specifically in the ICU setting where antibiotic use and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance are highly prevalent [40] . In this context, we speculate that antibiotic use in the subgroup of severe AECOPD with lower PCT (< 0.1 \u03bcg/L), could be reduced as previously reported in studies assessing a procalcitonin-based antibiotic strategy in non-severe lower respiratory tract infection [17, 18] ."", ""Conclusion"": ""Our results support that 40% of patients admitted to ICU for AECOPD have a low likelihood of bacterial infection and correlates with a PCT less than 0.1 \u03bcg/L, suggesting a possible inappropriate use of antibiotics. However, further studies are necessary: to assess the short-term effect of a procalcitonin-based therapeutic strategy in critically ill COPD patients in ICU and secondly, to address the role of antimicrobial agents in COPD patients in the long-term, particularly in patients with low PCT levels and bacteriapositive sputum."", ""Abbreviations"": ""AECOPD: acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; APACHE II: acute physiology and chronic health evaluation type II; MICU: medical intensive care unit; IFA: indirect immunofluorescence assay; LOD: logistic organ dysfunction system; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; PCT: procalcitonine; SAPS II: simplified acute physiology score II ""}",Procalcitonin levels in acute exacerbation of COPD admitted in ICU: a prospective cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotics are recommended for severe acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) admitted to intensive care units (ICU). Serum procalcitonin (PCT) could be a useful tool for selecting patients with a lower probability of developing bacterial infection, but its measurement has not been investigated in this population. METHODS: We conducted a single center prospective cohort study in consecutive COPD patients admitted to the ICU for AECOPD between September 2005 and September 2006. Sputum samples or tracheal aspirates were tested for the presence of bacteria and viruses. PCT levels were measured at the time of admittance, six hours, and 24 hours using a sensitive immunoassay. RESULTS: Thirty nine AECOPD patients were included, 31 of which (79%) required a ventilator support at admission. The median [25%–75% interquartile range] PCT level, assessed in 35/39 patients, was: 0.096 μg/L [IQR, 0.065 to 0.178] at the time of admission, 0.113 μg/L [IQR, 0.074 to 0.548] at six hours, and 0.137 μg/L [IQR, 0.088 to 0.252] at 24 hours. The highest PCT (PCTmax) levels were less than 0.1 μg/L in 14/35 (40%) patients and more than 0.25 μg/L in 10/35 (29%) patients, suggesting low and high probability of bacterial infection, respectively. Five species of bacteria and nine species of viruses were detected in 12/39 (31%) patients. Among the four patients positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one had a PCTmax less than 0.25 μg/L and three had a PCTmax less than 0.1 μg/L. The one patient positive for Haemophilus influenzae had a PCTmax more than 0.25 μg/L. The presence or absence of viruses did not influence PCT at time of admission (0.068 vs 0.098 μg/L respectively, P = 0.80). CONCLUSION: The likelihood of bacterial infection is low among COPD patients admitted to ICU for AECOPD (40% with PCT < 0.1 μg/L) suggesting a possible inappropriate use of antibiotics. Further studies are necessary to assess the impact of a procalcitonin-based therapeutic strategy in critically ill COPD patients.",10.1186/1471-2334-8-145,Medline; PMC,PMC2577677,18947382.0,cc-by,2008-10-23,BMC Infect Dis,,,,6840905.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-8-145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18947382/,2008.0,paper

These data suggest that the replication of RSV increases in the presence of C8/18. J. Med. Virol. 84:365-370, 2012 . "", ""MAIN TEXT"": ""Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), of the family Paramyxoviridae, subfamily Pneumovirinae, genus Pneumovirus, is a major causative agent of respiratory tract infections in children worldwide. Preterm children or those with underlying cardiopulmonary disorders are at a particularly high risk of developing severe and lethal RSV respiratory tract infections [American Academy of Pediatrics, 2003; Girard et al., 2005] .Previously, it was reported that viral infection, viral protein synthesis, and viral RNA replication operated efficiently in two RSV-inoculated human epithelial cell lines (HEp-2 and A549) but not in an RSV-inoculated human mast-cell line, HMC-1. To address the hypothesis that HMC-1 lacks the machinery required for RSV replication [Shirato and Taguchi, 2009 ], a cDNA subtraction assay was performed using HMC-1 cells and two human epithelial cell lines (A549 and HEp-2). Using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-Select cDNA Subtraction Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), A549 or HEp-2 cells were used as the tester, and HMC-1 cells were used as the driver. The cDNA synthesis, adapter ligation, first hybridization, and second hybridization steps were performed following the manufacturer's protocol, with modifications. After the second hybridization step, PCR and nested PCR were performed using Advantage cDNA polymerase (Clontech) and primers supplied in the PCR-select cDNA Subtraction Kit. The obtained PCR products were then cloned into the pT7Blue2-vector (EMD4B biosciences, Gibbstown, NJ), and colonies were selected. The subtraction assay was performed three times, yielding a total of 49 clones for A549 versus HMC-1 and 85 clones for HEp-2 versus HMC-1. The sequences of these clones were confirmed using a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with SP6 and U19mer reverse primers. Using BLASTn to identify sequence homologies, three genes (Cytokeratin 18, GenBank accession no. X12883; Laminin receptor homolog, S35960; and H. sapiens CL100 mRNA for protein tyrosine phosphatase, X68277) were identified as common to both A549 versus HMC-1 and HEp-2 versus HMC-1 experiments ( Table I) . Among them, cytokeratin 18 (C18) was detected in 2 out of 85 tests (HEp-2 vs. HMC-1 cells) and in 19 out of 49 tests (A549 vs. HMC-1 cells).C18 is an acidic cytokeratin that belongs to the cytokeratin family. This 20-member cytokeratin family is divided into acidic type I cytokeratins (9-20) and basic type II cytokeratins (1-8). These cytokeratins are usually expressed together in a combination of acidic and basic cytokeratins, and the acidic protein C18 is generally expressed together with the basic protein cytokeratin 8 (C8) in simple epithelia [Moll et al., 1982] .To date, a few reports have suggested a relationship between RSV infection and the cytoskeleton. Jeffree et al. [2007] reported a close physical interaction between filamentous actin and the virus in RSV infection involving inclusion bodies and viral filaments. It was previously reported that RSV infection induced the up-regulation of C17 gene expression in a NF-kB signaling pathway-dependent manner, and the expression of C17 was associated with the syncytia formation of RSV [Domachowske et al., 2000] . Garcia-Barreno et al. [1988] reported that N protein of RSV required a maturation period after synthesis to associate with certain cytoskeletal intermediate filaments. They also reported that C18 in RSV-infected HEp-2 cells was modified in a way other than phosphorylation. Thus, a relationship between RSV replication and C18 has been suggested, but it is unclear whether C18 plays a role in RSV replication.The expression of cytoskeleton mRNA was compared among A549, HEp-2, and HMC-1 cells using a quantitative real-time PCR assay (Fig. 1 ). There were no marked differences in mRNA expression of vimentin or g-actin among the cell types except for vimentin expression in HEp-2 cells. b-Actin expression was slightly lower in A549 and HEp-2 cells relative to HMC-1 cells. By contrast, the expression of C18 mRNA in A549 and HEp-2 cells was 100-to 1,000-fold greater than in HMC-1 cells (n \u00bc 4, P < 0.01). These findings show that the RSV-susceptible cell lines express C18 while the unsusceptible cell line does not. Taken together, these data suggest that C18 might be involved in the replication of RSV in HEp-2 and A549 cells. Because C18 is predominantly expressed in HEp-2 cells [Price et al., 1988] , and was identified by subtraction experiments as one of the genes expressed in both of the RSV-sensitive cell lines but not in HMC-1 cells, the role of C18 in RSV replication was examined further.To elucidate the general physiological function of C18 in RSV infection, plasmids encoding C18 and C8 were co-transfected into HMC-1 cells and selected using 2 mg/ml puromycin to establish HMC-1-C8/18 cells. Although HMC-1-C8/18 cell growth was slower than that of the original HMC-1 cells, the expression of these genes did not affect cell viability (Fig. 2a) . C8/18 mRNA expression in HMC-1-C8/18 cells was H. sapiens CL 100 mRNA for protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 1 Fig. 1 . mRNA expression of cytoskeletons in A549, HEp-2, and HMC-1 cells. Total RNA was extracted with a Total RNA Isolation Mini Kit (Agilent, Wilmington, DE) and first-strand cDNA was synthesized with M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) and Random Hexamer (ABI). Real-time PCR analysis was performed using a LightCycler 480 with its probe master reagent (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and specific primer and probe sets sold by Applied Biosystems Inc (ABI; C18, Hs01649353_g1; vimentin, Hs00185584_m1; b-actin, Hs03023880_g1; and g-actin, Hs02340971_gH). Human GAPDH was used as an internal control. The data were analyzed using the comparative Ct method and expressed as relative to the data obtained from the HMC-1 cells (n \u00bc 4; P < 0.01). 100-to 1,000-fold higher than that in HMC-1 cells (Fig. 2b ). C8/18 expression was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2c) . The frequency of C8/18 doublepositive cells was 5.3% in HMC-1 cells and 64.8% in A549 cells. By contrast, 41.6% of the HMC-1-C8/18 cells were double-positive using the same cut-off, indicating that the HMC-1-C8/18 cells expressed C8/18 at higher levels than the original HMC-1 cells.The replication efficiency of RSV in the presence of C18 was examined using HMC-1-C8/18 cells. Productive RSV RNA replication in HMC-1 cells was not detected by plaque assay in a previous study [Shirato and Taguchi, 2009] ; therefore, in this study the replication of RSV in HMC-1-C8/18 cells was detected using real-time PCR. The consensus RSV type A and B/RSV matrix gene probe and primer set described by Kuypers et al. [2004] was used. RSV RNA was quantified using a standard curve obtained from serially diluted virus stocks that were pre-titrated by plaque assay; the obtained values were normalized with the 18s rRNA values from the same sample. Therefore, the RSV RNA copy number was determined as the ratio of the log 10 PFU/1 ng of 18s rRNA. The relationship between PFU value and RNA copy number was confirmed in the present study [Shirato et al., 2007; Shirato and Taguchi, 2009 ]. First, RSV was directly inoculated onto the cells and incubated at 348C; viral RNA was detected at the indicated number of days postinfection (dpi) (Fig. 3a) . Identical to the previous report, a >100-fold productive increase in RSV RNA was seen in the A549 cells, while the copy number of RSV RNA was low in the HMC-1 cells over the course of infection. In contrast, the amount of RSV RNA in HMC-1C8/18 cells increased slightly but was significantly higher than that in HMC-1 cells (n \u00bc 4; P < 0.01). As described previously, RSV was able to infect HMC-1, but the efficiency of RSV infection in HMC-1 was very low [Shirato and Taguchi, 2009 ]. It has been reported that spinoculation is a good method for forcing virion attachment to cells for retroviruses Fig. 2 . Cloning of HMC-1-C8/18 cells. a: Growth kinetics of HMC-1 and HMC-1-C8/18 cells. First, 5 \u00c2 10 4 cells were incubated with 10% FCS-IMDM in six-well plates; the cell concentrations were determined every third day (n \u00bc 6). b: C8/18 mRNA expression in A549, HMC-1, and HMC-1-C8/18 cells. Total RNA was extracted, first-strand cDNA was synthesized, and real-time PCR was performed with specific primer and probe sets for C8 (ABI, Hs02339473_g1) and C18 with 18s rRNA (ABI, 4352930) as an internal control. The data are expressed as relative values compared to those of parental HMC-1 cells. c: Flow cytometric analysis of C8/18 expression. For C18 detection, cells were stained with specific chicken IgY polyclonal antibodies (GenWay, San Diego, CA) and donkey anti-chicken IgY, biotin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) followed by PE-conjugated streptavidin (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA). For C8 detection, cells were stained with a mouse monoclonal antibody (M20; GeneTex, Irvine, CA) followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Zymed, South San Francisco, CA). Flow cytometry was performed using the FACSCalibur system (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). and coronaviruses [O'Doherty et al., 2000; Watanabe et al., 2006] . Therefore, spinoculation (3,000 rpm for 2 h at 48C) was performed to increase viral infectivity. The spinoculation of RSV increased the amount of virus entering the HMC-1 cells by two-to threefold compared with standard inoculation (data not shown). As a result, the amount of RSV RNA was increased to the level in A549 cells at 4 dpi, whereas that in HMC-1 was unchanged (Fig. 3b , n \u00bc 4; P < 0.01). These results suggest that the amount of RSV RNA in the HMC-1 cells increased in the presence of C8/18. Because a large amount of RSV RNA was detected in the HMC-1-C8/18 cells after spinoculation (Fig. 3b) , the infectious virus titer was determined by plaque assay. RSV-containing 10% fetal calf serum-Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (FCS-IMDM) was added to the cells and spinoculated at 3,000 rpm for 2 h at 48C. Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated at 348C in 10% FCS-IMDM. At the indicated dpi, the cells and supernatants were collected separately, and the amount of virus was determined by plaque assay using HEp-2 cells. As shown in Figure 3c , a large number of infectious virus particles were detected in the HMC-1-C8/18 cell fraction, and the titer was similar to that in A549 cells; in contrast, a productive increase in virus was not seen in HMC-1 over the course of infection. Conversely, the amount of infectious virus in the HMC-1-C8/18 cell supernatant was 100-fold lower than that in A549 cells, although the titer was 10-fold higher than that in Fig. 3 . Replication kinetics of RSV genes as detected by real-time PCR and plaque assay. a and b: Kinetics of the RSV copies upon infection by direct inoculation or spinoculation as detected by realtime PCR. Cells were inoculated with RSV at an MOI of 1 (a) by direct inoculation or (b) spinoculation at 3,000 rpm for 2 h at 48C. For spinoculation, the cells were mixed with 500 ml of 10% FCS-IMDM and added to each well of type I collagen-coated 24-well plates (AGC Techno Glass, Chiba, Japan). At the indicated dpi, cells were collected, total RNA was extracted, and first-strand cDNA was synthesized as described in the legend for Figure 1 . Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with an RSV-specific primer and probe set. To quantify RSV RNA, a standard curve obtained from serially diluted virus stocks with known PFU values was used. The quantity of RNA was determined from the standard curve and normalized against 18s rRNA values from the same sample. The amount of RSV RNA is presented as the ratio of the log 10 PFU/1 ng of 18s rRNA (n \u00bc 4; P < 0.01). c and d: Kinetics of the infectious RSV titer upon infection by spinoculation as detected by plaque assay. Cells were inoculated with RSV at an MOI of 1 by spinoculation at 3,000 rpm for 2 h at 48C. At the indicated dpi, (c) the cells and (d) supernatants were collected separately, and the RSV titer was determined by plaque assay using HEp-2 cells. The titers are presented as the (c) log 10 PFU/well and (d) log 10 PFU/ml (n \u00bc 6).HMC-1 during the same period (Fig. 3d) . These results suggest that infectious virus was produced in the HMC-1-C8/18 cell fraction after spinoculation and that the mean of virus release into the HMC-1-C8/18 culture medium was different from that into the A549 medium.Next, to elucidate the effects of C18 on RSV replication from the opposite side, C18 was knocked down in A549 cells. A549 cells were transfected with a plasmid carrying a C18-specific or control shRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Cells were selected and cloned in the presence of 2 mg/ml puromycin. C18 expression in the knocked-down A549 cells was decreased, and the knock down of C18 influenced C8 expression (Fig. 4a) . C18 mRNA expression was decreased to 24 AE 4%, and that of C8 was decreased to 49 AE 5% compared with the shRNA-controlled A549 cells (Fig. 4b) . The sequence homology between C18 and C8 is about 50%, and it is possible that the shRNA for C18 might affect the C8 gene. Next, the cells were infected with RSV, and the titers were determined at 2 and 4 dpi by plaque assay; the results are presented as the relative titer (%); that in the shRNA-controlled cells was 100%. As shown in Figure 4c , the RSV titer decreased to 45 AE 20% and 7 AE 4% at 2 and 4 dpi, respectively. This result suggests that the production of descendant viruses in A549 cells decreases depending on the amount of C8/18. Garcia-Barreno et al. [1988] reported that C18 in RSV-infected HEp-2 cells received some modification, and they suggested a relationship between RSV replication and C18. However, it was unclear whether C18 plays a role in RSV replication. The results of the present study show that the production of RSV was altered depending on the presence or absence of C8/18 because the amount of RSV increased in C8/18expressing HMC-1 cells and decreased in A549 cells expressing reduced levels of C8/18. These findings suggest that RSV replication is influenced by C8/18 and that RSV production is increased in the presence of C8/18. Domachowske et al. [2000] reported that while constitutive expression of C17 was normally restricted in basal epithelial cells in the lung, RSV infection increased the expression of C17 in lung epithelial cells. This increase was associated with fusion formation, and blocking the F protein by a specific antibody prevented it. Moreover, the localization of C17 was consistent with cell fusion [Domachowske et al., 2000] . Thus, RSV infection itself could alter the expression profile of the intracellular filament network in the infected cell and could induce the expression of cell components needed for the virus to spread via cell-tocell transmission.The expression level of C8/18 may likewise be changed after RSV infection and may be involved in cell fusion formation and the cell-to-cell spread of RSV. HMC-1 cells are derived from mesenchymal cells [Butterfield et al., 1988] and as described in this study, HMC-1 cells do not express the C18 gene constitutively. However, this study showed that external expression of C8/18 could allow the replication of RSV even in HMC-1 cells. The present data also showed that viral load continued at high levels in the presence of C8/18 but decreased in the absence of C8/18. These results suggest that the presence of C8/18 intracellularly before RSV infection is important for the later RSV replication cycle, although further studies are needed to elucidate the direct effect of C8/18 on RSV replication.As for other viruses, several reports have shown a relationship between viral infections and C8/18. For example, it was reported that C18 was phosphorylated [Liao et al., 1995] and that C18 rearrangement [Brunet et al., 2000] occurred after rotavirus infection without cell death; moreover, it was suggested that these virus-induced structural alterations caused functional perturbations in the intestine. In adenovirus infection, the cleavage of C18 by adenovirus proteinase causes destruction of the cytoskeletal network, which is thought to promote cell lysis and nascent virion release [Staufenbiel et al., 1986; Chen Fig. 4 . a and b: Cloning of C18 knocked-down and shRNA control A549 cells. a: Western blot analysis of C8/C18 expression. Cells were mixed with SDS sample buffer and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. C18 was detected with a biotin-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody (DC-10; Abcam) and HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Zymed). C8 was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody (GeneTex) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). GAPDH was detected with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Imgenex, San Diego, CA) and HRP-conjugated guinea pig anti-rabbit antibodies (Rockland). b: C8 and C18 mRNA expression in cloned cells. Total RNA was extracted, and first-strand cDNA was synthesized for real-time PCR as described in the legend for Figure 1 using GAPDH as an internal control (n \u00bc 7; \u00c3 P < 0.01). c: Viral replication kinetics in C18 knocked-down A549 cells. Cells were infected with RSV at an MOI of 1 and incubated for 2-4 days. Cells were collected and the titers were determined by plaque assay using HEp-2 cells (n \u00bc 4). et al., 1993] . These reports suggest a role of C18 in the later stages of viral infection (e.g., virus release).The results of this study showed that infectious virus production increased in the HMC-1-C8/18 cell fraction after spinoculation, although the titer in the supernatant was low compared with that in A549 cells. This result implies the possibility that C8/18 may function not in virus release into the culture medium, but in replication within host cells. RSV is assembled in lipid rafts at the apical membrane, and budding is controlled by the apical recycling endosome-associated protein Rab11 family interacting protein 2 [Brock et al., 2003; McCurdy and Graham, 2003; Brown et al., 2004; Utley et al., 2008] ; notably, HMC-1 may lack this type of mechanism for releasing virions into the cell-culture medium.In summary, this paper demonstrates that RSV production increases in the presence of C8/18 in a cell-culture system. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the direct effect of C8/18 on RSV replication and to determine the involvement of C18 in cell fusion formation.""}",Increased replication of respiratory syncytial virus in the presence of cytokeratin 8 and 18,"Previously, it was reported that productive viral infection, viral protein synthesis, and viral RNA replication of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) operated efficiently in two human epithelial cell lines (HEp‐2 and A549), but not in a human mast‐cell line, HMC‐1. Based on these observations, it was hypothesized that HMC‐1 cells lack the machinery required for RSV replication. To identify the host factors required for RSV replication, cDNA subtraction using A549, HEp‐2, and HMC‐1 cells was performed, and cytokeratin 18 (C18) was identified as a candidate host factor. Because C18 is generally expressed in simple epithelia with cytokeratin 8 (C8), HMC‐1 cells that constitutively express C18 and C8 (HMC‐1‐C8/18) were established to evaluate the role of C8/18 in RSV replication. In HMC‐1‐C8/18 cells, RSV RNA replication was increased, and the amount of infective virus produced was also increased in the cellular fraction after RSV spinoculation, whereas RSV production was decreased in A549 cells in which C18 expression was knocked down. These data suggest that the replication of RSV increases in the presence of C8/18. J. Med.

Even though the pandemic appears to be slowing in some areas, concerns exist for a resurgence of the virus in the setting of relaxation of social distancing regulations, and for a more severe pandemic in the coming months. Intensive care unit (ICU) beds, ventilators, dialysis machines, and personal protective equipment (PPE) have been, and may again become, scarce commodities for which construction and production lag behind need in most regions. Healthcare workers have also been in short supply, particularly when they fall ill and are quarantined, hospitalized, or succumb to the disease. This document therefore seeks to describe the salient clinical and ethical issues surrounding triage and rationing decisions in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic (Central Illustration) and provide recommendations for cardiovascular clinicians (Figure 1) . The discussion and recommendations herein draw upon enduring principles ( Table 1 ) but also a current knowledge base that is in flux. The experience, science, and response to COVID-19 are rapidly changing and often depend on local practices and protocols. Table 1) . For the most part, these decisions will pertain to ICU beds, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuits but may involve personal protective equipment (PPE) and other resources in short supply. Many cardiovascular clinicians involved in heart and/or lung transplantation are well-versed in processes that strive to maximize the beneficial use of scarce resources while ensuring fairness, and often prioritizing the sickest patients who are likely to benefit from intervention. These considerations influence both listing and allocation of organs and are also important in crisis standards of care during a pandemic. An important value implicit in age limits in listing for organ transplant is the concept of \""fair innings\"" or \""life cycles\""-the idea that scarce resource distribution should favor those who have not had the opportunity to experience the full spectrum of life, rather than older patients who have already had their \""fair innings\"". Employing this bias in favor of the young is more controversial in resource allocation during a pandemic than when applied to transplant listing."", ""Principles and Values for Allocation of Scarce Medical Resources"": ""More controversial still is the promotion of instrumental or social value: maximizing the value of clinical interventions to society beyond direct patient benefits. The idea is that scarce resources are preferentially allocated in a way that exerts the broadest benefit. In practical terms, the promotion of instrumental or social value could be grounds for giving healthcare workers priority to receive critical care support to maximize their chances of recovery in order to provide care for more patients in the future.Importantly, the superseding value of patient self-determination (autonomy) that normally operates in clinical care may necessarily become subordinate when triage decisions, based on need and ability to benefit, aim to maximize the number of lives saved. While the preferences of individual patients and the clinical judgment of their clinicians remain important, these values may need to yield in triage situations (3) ."", ""Implementation"": ""There are many ways to maximize benefits, including maximizing the number of lives saved or life-years saved. These specific aims are often cited as the highest priorities during a natural disaster. Practically, this usually means allocating scarce resources to patients who are sick enough to benefit but also have the best chance of survival in the short term and possibly the longer term. Those less likely to benefit in these ways may have these resources withheld or withdrawn.Ensuring fairness involves providing equal access to scarce resources without regard to factors that are not relevant to prognosis and maximizing lives saved. There is broad agreement that allocation of interventions should not be influenced by factors such as name recognition, race or ethnicity, sex or gender identity, religion, sexual orientation, income, financial assets, family situation or social contacts and, of course, whether a patient is likeable or otherwise.Safeguards to ensure fairness bar those who make triage decisions from considering these elements in making allocation decisions.Strict utilitarian approaches that prioritize saving the maximum number of lives raise questions of ageism and discrimination against those with already afflicted with severe chronic disease and frailty. Considering these factors is usually justified by the fact that they significantly influence prognosis, but an important factor is the difference between short term and long term mortality. If the latter is prioritized, this discrimination can be compounded, particularly as the definition and determination of \""long term\"" are complicated. More concerning, however, is that these approaches may disadvantage patients with disabilities, particularly if maximizing quality, an inherently subjective metric, is included as a value.Additional safeguards to avoid improper discrimination in the care of patients with disabilities and COVID-19 have been advanced by the United States Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights in Action.(4) Pertinent elements of triage related to prognosis will change as more is known about prognostic factors in COVID-19.Operationalizing the promotion of instrumental or social value involves many controversies, in addition to the disadvantaging of persons with disabilities. There is wide consensus that allocation decisions must not be made on the basis of perceived present or future social worth except, possibly, for one group-healthcare workers. An expected shortage of trained clinicians, in particular, provides the rationale for allocating scarce resources toward \""returning them to the battle.\"" A number of controversial points emerge beyond questions of fairness that relate to relative instrumental or social value. All healthcare workers are not the same, and some are much more \""essential\"" in the setting of a pandemic. For instance, clinicians with expertise in emergency medicine, critical care, and infectious disease could be seen to carry more \""instrumental value\"" than general cardiologists. Furthermore, the level and duration of training impacts the ability to maintain the workforce-it takes longer to train a surgeon than a medical assistant. More broadly, there are other non-medical workers that are essential to a functioning society, from law enforcement, military personnel, and institutional leaders, to sanitation and delivery workers. Finally, clinicians' readiness to return to work soon after ICU stays is questionable, potentially attenuating the instrumental or social value of prioritizing them in regards to scarce resources. Preferentially allocating ICU beds and ventilators to clinicians is quite different in terms of social value than preferentially providing them with vaccines or prophylactic treatments.(5) These considerations must be balanced against the argument that the efforts of front-line healthcare workers should be recognized in allocation policies, especially in the setting of PPE shortages, at least as a bulwark against absenteeism."", ""Contingency vs. Crisis: Not to be confused"": ""Most plans for crisis standards of care currently being discussed or implemented are not completely new. Local, regional, and national disaster response frameworks have included planning for pandemics for years, though of course the actual response to a particular situation involves unique nuances."", ""Conventional, Contingency, and Crisis Standards of Care"": ""A crucial distinction must be made between three standards of care. (6) \u2022 \""Conventional\"" standard of care is the normal situation in which demand does not threaten to outstrip supply, and the regular standards for care and operating procedures are in place. In anticipation of future difficulties, there may be special attempts to avoid waste and conserve resources, but none of these substantially impact the conventional delivery of care.\u2022 \""Contingency\"" standards of care are currently in place for many health systems and may remain so for some time. Resources are not yet overwhelmed, but there is a significant concern this will happen in the near future. Standard operating procedures have been altered in order to conserve, re-use, or substitute for potentially scarce resources. Creative use of other resources may be employed. Some degree of rationing may take place, or care plans altered, but at least basic standards of care are maintained.\u2022 \""Crisis\"" standards alter the system and delivery of care. Despite conservation, reuse, substitution and adaptation, demands outstrip supplies and some needs go unmet. Normal standards of care can no longer be followed, needs must be triaged, and resources must be allocated to some patients but not others, and some resources will be reallocated (withdrawn from some patients and given to others). A true crisis involves region-wide shortages, not just shortages at a specific hospital. Triage decisions will involve all patients, not just those with COVID-19. In a crisis capacity situation, for instance, a ventilator should be allocated to a patient with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure instead of a patient with end stage heart failure patient if doing so would be likely to maximize benefits. Importantly, clinicians must not employ crisis standards of care when at contingency capacity. During both conventional and contingency standards of care, patient autonomy maintains its position of primacy in medical decision-making. Only in crisis standards of care must patient autonomy in some ways be subordinated to the larger goal of protecting the lives of as many patients as possible. Clinicians operating under contingency standards of care will experience a tendency to anticipate the next level, but should avoid inappropriate denial of care to certain patients or reallocating resources from one patient to another. Procedures deemed elective and those that can be safely postponed should be deferred. Resources should be conserved, but testing and therapeutic treatments necessary to avoid morbidity and mortality should be implemented."", ""Allocation and Reallocation"": ""The determination of crisis conditions will be made by local and regional officials.Regional collaboration should allow the shifting of resources between hospitals and clinics to meet needs. In many jurisdictions, triage teams, rather than bedside clinicians, will make decisions about which patients will receive life-sustaining intervention (allocation) and whether resources will be withdrawn from one patient and given to another (reallocation). (7) The principles and values under which these triage teams operate, the factors they consider in making decisions, and the composition of the teams, should be transparent, though the identities of individual team members may not. Decisions made by triage teams and the information and values upon which they are based are imperfect but necessary to alleviate moral distress for individual clinicians and may provide them legal protection. (8) Clinicians, with more detailed knowledge of individual patients, may find resulting decisions disappointing and even distressing. Procedures that attempt to avoid inappropriate bias however, must try to shield triage teams from the influence of factors that are relevant to the care of individuals but not to the fair allocation of scarce medical resources. Implementing decisions about reallocating resources from one patient to another may be much more difficult than withholding them, whether or not one made the decision. Reallocation of resources may be made after time-limited trials to see if recovery or improvement is possible, and if not, these resources might be reallocated to another patient. This is particularly true with the use of ECMO for the acute lung injury and myocarditis associated with COVID-19. Removing a lifesustaining therapy in order to provide it to a patient with a better chance of survival may compound the moral distress experienced by clinicians in crisis situations.Furthermore, bedside clinicians may be placed in the difficult position of communicating a decision they did not make, while bearing the brunt of negative reactions to that decision. In communicating decisions, clinicians must outline the principles underlying allocation decisions in crisis capacity situations, including the processes in place to ensure fairness. This process may be aided by public education about crisis standards of care and triage protocols. Some have advocated that patients admitted to the hospital be made aware that life-sustaining resources may be withdrawn from them during crisis standards of care. (2) In some regional triage protocols, there are mechanisms to appeal triage team decisions, and clinicians will be placed in the difficult position of making the choice to request a review of a decision they deem inappropriate "", ""Resuscitation decisions"": ""Determination of resuscitation status is a distinct issue from triage, and while these issues may share overlapping considerations, they should not be conflated. Physicians may advocate that very ill patients with a low likelihood of survival or neurologic recovery be assigned a status of \""do not attempt resuscitation\"" (DNAR), regardless of the scarcity of resources. This recommendation is typically made in a situation in which cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is deemed either medically inappropriate or physiologically futile, quantitatively futile (low chance of benefit) or qualitatively futile (unlikely to achieve goals of care) (9). COVID-19 may factor into these decisions if it confers a grave prognosis and adds to the futility of resuscitation attempts. Ideally this should be a shared decision that takes into account both the expert recommendations of the treating physician as well as the goals, values, and preferences of the patient.However, there is a general ethical consensus that clinicians are not required to provide futile care. Some medical centers have policies outlining processes for enacting DNAR in the absence of agreement by the patient or surrogate. Such \""unilateral DNAR\"" orders usually involve the agreement of a second physician not involved in the patient's care. Assent (not consent) of the patient or surrogate may be sought, meaning that the patient or surrogate is asked to agree to allowing natural death, but the decision to not attempt CPR is not predicated on the agreement. Most unilateral DNAR policies require that patients and surrogates be fully informed of the process of determination to place a DNAR order and the reasons underlying the decision, including a clear explanation of the medical inappropriateness or futility of resuscitation attempts. Some require offer of transfer to another medical center. Clinicians require skills to refocus goals of care on palliation rather than life-prolongation if the latter is not meaningfully attainable. They must explicitly let patients and families know that they will manage symptoms and will not abandon the patient.(10) Acknowledgement of anticipatory bereavement on the part of the patient and family are essential to this conversation. It can take time for family and friends to process their grief and say goodbye, especially if they were previously unprepared to do so. Support can be provided by interdisciplinary palliative care providers, or chaplains and social workers trained in bereavement support.During a pandemic crisis, unique considerations exist. Critically ill patients with COVID-19 who have ventilator-dependent respiratory failure and progress to cardiorespiratory arrest in most cases would not be expected to derive benefit from CPR. Conversely, health care workers who administer CPR to patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of contracting the infection themselves due to enhanced infectious spread through aerosolization of viral particles during a \""code.\"" There is a moral imperative to protect health care workers from undue harm, especially when patients are unlikely to benefit, in part because of the need to preserve their health so that they can continue to provide care to other patients. Furthermore, the scarcity of personal protective equipment (PPE) raises questions about its use during a predictably futile resuscitation attempt. Although there is a general consensus that withholding and withdrawing are not ethically distinct, in practice it can be more emotionally difficult to withdraw life-sustaining interventions than to withhold them in triage situations. Clinicians, patients, surrogates, and patients' loved ones may view withdrawal as killing the patient, though it represents allowing the lifethreatening underlying illness to take its course. In cardiology, ethical controversy exists in relation to removing temporary and durable mechanical circulatory support, deactivating the shocking function of implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and turning off pacemakers, particularly in pacemaker-dependent patients (11) (12) (13) ."", ""Withholding/withdrawing life-sustaining therapies"": ""Decisions about withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining interventions ideally are made with the patient and/or surrogate without regard to resource utilization, leaving triage decisions to triage teams. However, unique withholding considerations exist in relation to COVID-19. Catheterization procedures on patients with COVID-19 consume PPE and require cleaning of facilities, in addition to risking exposures during the procedure and transport. Other means of differentiating ischemia from other causes of troponin elevation besides invasive angiography may be warranted in the setting of COVID-19, and non-interventional treatments such as the use of thrombolytics for STEMI may be more widely utilized. (14) In end-of-life care, deactivation of cardiac devices will need to be considered for patients made DNAR and those who are removed from ventilators or denied ICU care by triage team decisions. Clinicians should not hide these considerations from patients and surrogates. Rather, they should transparently address the conflicting interests that arise during a pandemic. Cardiovascular clinicians will continue to play a significant role in such decisions under contingency and crisis standards of care."", ""Advance Care Planning"": ""The COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to encourage more widespread care planning in advance of serious illness. All patients should appoint a durable power of attorney for health care or surrogate decision-maker or reconfirm their surrogates if already appointed.Cardiovascular clinicians should help patients consider their values, goals, and preferences and discuss these with their surrogates and loved ones. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in prohibitions of visitors for hospitalized patients in many institutions. Patients may opt for home hospice when they become seriously ill, since they would not be able to be surrounded by loved ones in the hospital.In advance care planning discussions, clinicians should not coerce patients into decisions to forego potentially beneficial medical interventions, hospitalization, or ICU transfer. Unilateral DNAR orders are generally not appropriate in the outpatient setting and should not be enacted outside of local hospital procedures. However, it is appropriate to talk with patients prospectively about care that is consistent with their expressed values and provide information about the risks and benefits of interventions if applicable. Cardiovascular clinicians may need to correct misperceptions about COVID-19 and underlying cardiovascular disease (e.g. that all older patients with cardiovascular disease who contract COVID-19 will die), in addition to any misconceptions that patients hold with respect to cardiovascular interventions."", ""Fiduciary Duties in Crisis"": ""Healthcare workers have a professional duty to care for patients even when this entails considerable personal sacrifice. (15, 16) However, this duty does not exist in a vacuum. Medical institutions have a duty to ensure adequate PPE and testing during a pandemic, and society as a whole has a duty to practice social distancing to \""flatten the curve\"" and slow the spread of disease. Furthermore, government has a duty to ensure an adequate supply chain for the former and appropriate legal support for the latter. Individual liberty and personal autonomy must be weighed against public health and the greater good during a pandemic.Additionally, the duty of healthcare workers to provide care needs to be weighed against other potentially conflicting obligations. Avoidance of high risk exposure may be appropriate for clinicians who are older, have dependents, are pregnant, are immunocompromised, or have chronic cardiopulmonary disease. The supply of PPE may also play a role in these decisions.Those who are making duty schedules, however, may experience significant difficulties in balancing competing interests among clinicians. It is difficult, for example, to weigh mitigating exposure risk for a single caregiver of children vs. a single caregiver for an elderly parent vs. a two-clinician family with no extended support network. These questions do not have easy answers but require careful consideration.There is also a fiduciary duty toward patients who do not have COVID-19. As elective diagnostic and interventional procedures are postponed and resources are shifted, there is a risk that non-COVID-19 cardiovascular morbidity and mortality may rise. Cardiovascular clinicians should not lose sight of these needs of these patients and provide as high-quality care as possible."", ""Conclusions"": ""The COVID-19 pandemic has stretched the resources of many healthcare institutions and threatens to do so again in a resurgence. Difficult decisions about allocating these resources will follow principles and values, some of which may diverge from the autonomy-based decisionmaking systems predominant during conventional situations. Contingency and crisis standards of care in the face of a disaster change the way we practice cardiovascular medicine, but the duties of cardiovascular clinicians remain focused on individual patients."", ""Highlights"": ""\u2022 Difficult decisions about triage and allocation have arisen in the COVID-19 pandemic "", ""Autonomy"": ""The principle that every person (patient) has the right to self-determination as a moral agent of infinite worth. This principle occupies a position of primacy in current Western medical ethics and is operationalized by the ubiquity of informed consent. Clinicians may not unilaterally withhold or withdraw medically appropriate or indicated treatment without the consent of a patient or surrogate. In a pandemic crisis, this principle may be superseded by the imperative to maximize public health when resources become scarce and require judicious allocation or rationing."", ""Beneficence/Nonmaleficence"": ""The principle that physicians have a duty to provide care to promote the health and wellness of their patients, and they also have a duty to avoid causing harm to patients. Given that all treatments pose some theoretical risk of harm (however small), implicit in this definition is that the imperative is to avoid net harm. However, in a nod to autonomy as a first principle, clinicians may not impose any treatments without a patient's informed consent. In a pandemic crisis, a clinician's paramount duty remains his or her commitment to individual patients, recognizing this may conflict with the duty of our profession as a whole to promote and protect public health when resources become scarce. As such, bedside physicians should not be expected to triage their own patients out of receiving what they consider optimal care, and these decisions instead should be made by an independent and impartial triage team."", ""Justice"": ""The principle that patients should have equitable access to resources, or that resources should be fairly allocated regardless of patients' age, sex or gender identity, race or ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status, religion, putative \""VIP\"" status, and similar individual factors. This does not necessarily mean that everyone has \""equality\"" in access, or the same chance as others at accessing resources, but rather that \""equity\"" is ensured such that those who need resources the most and those who are most likely to benefit receive preferential access to scarce resources. However, there may be conflicting considerations at play, which makes resource allocation ethically challenging (especially during a pandemic crisis)"", ""--Fair Innings"": ""The notion that all people have the right, whenever possible, to experiences all life stages, and as such that the young should be prioritized over the elderly when resources are limited. Another more utilitarian argument for prioritizing the young over the elderly is that advanced age is correlated with decreased physiological reserve, and if the greater good entails the maximization of lives or life-years saved, this will not be achieved if age is not factored into triage protocols. Opponents argue this is tantamount to age discrimination.--Instrumental Value The notion that certain individuals should receive priority access not just because of their intrinsic value as human beings (which every person has in equal and infinite measure), but also because of their instrumental value to other human beings. Many caution against using the concept of \""social worth\"" in granting anyone preferential treatment during a pandemic as this can easily devolve into discrimination. However, many also make an exception for health care workers, arguing that prioritizing them incentivizes them to continue working and thus reduces voluntary absenteeism, and also that making sure healthcare workers receive medical treatment helps to return more of them to the workforce so that they can continue caring for more patients in the future. Opponents argue this can lead to discrimination against those with disabilities.""}",Allocating Scarce Resources and Triaging Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic and its sequelae have created scenarios of scarce medical resources, leading to the prospect that healthcare systems have faced or will face difficult decisions about triage, allocation and reallocation. These decisions should be guided by ethical principles and values, should not be made before crisis standards have been declared by authorities, and, in most cases, will not be made by bedside clinicians. Do not attempt resuscitation (DNAR) and withholding and withdrawing decisions should be made according to standard determination of medical appropriateness and futility, but there are unique considerations during a pandemic. Transparent and clear communication is crucial, coupled with dedication to provide the best possible care to patients, including palliative care. As medical knowledge about COVID-19 grows, more will be known about prognostic factors that can guide these difficult decisions.",10.1016/j.jacc.2020.05.006,Elsevier; Medline; PMC; WHO,PMC7213960,32407772.0,els-covid,2020-05-11,J Am Coll Cardiol,,#2006809655,,218582766.0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109720352232?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735109720352232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32407772/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.05.006,2020.0,paper

Although many studies have examined crisis management (Comfort 2007; Comfort et al. 2012; Moynihan 2008) , COVID-19 appears to present new challenges because of the scale and speed of infections. This study aims to discuss key governance and policy issues that have been revealed in the course of making critical decisions about preparing for, mitigating, and responding to the outbreak. In particular, this essay examines key policy issues identified in the South Korean government's initial response to the outbreak, then draws some lessons and policy implications for other countries that have been experiencing the same challenges as the pandemic situation continues."", ""The Outbreak of COVID-19 in the World and South Korea"": ""COVID-19 was reported to have originated in Wuhan, Hubei, China. Initially, COVID-19 appeared to be similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and particularly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). However, it is more contagious and more impactful in provoking economic and social instability and igniting psychological fears of individuals than previous infectious diseases. For example, as figure 1 suggests, the number of infected patients has grown much faster than previous diseases, reaching about 2.5 million (with more than 160,000 deaths) in about four months as of April 19, 2020. 1 In comparison, SARS and MERS reached 8,096 patients in eight months and 203 patients in a year, respectively (Wu and Chow 2020) . 2 In addition, COVID-19's geographic spread has been much wider, reaching the pandemic stage in about 150 countries as of April 19, 2020, 3 Figure 2 Active COVID-19 Cases in South Korea the city of Daegu and from Kyungbook Province. The majority (about 60 percent) of the confirmed cases were from these two areas as of the middle of March 2020, as a church member known as \""Patient 31\"" (a super spreader) infected many other members during worship in a Shincheonji church in Daegu, which suddenly became the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea.With the unexpected spike in COVID-19 cases in Daegu and Kyungbook Province, the South Korean government raised its alert to the highest level and took a series of actions ranging from full-scale epidemiological investigation of infected patients to medical and economic policy packages. Of course, the government experienced obstacles in negotiating with the religious group to acquire necessary information such as church members' contact information and the locations of church facilities in order to identify possible infected patients and to prevent possible future infections.Thanks to agile, adaptive, and transparent actions by the South Korean government, along with citizens' active participation in Figure 1 Comparison of COVID-19, SARS, and MERS social distancing, the rate of infection began to drop dramatically. As figure 2 shows, the number of infected patients under treatment was reduced to 2,484 (out of more than 10,000 total confirmed patients) as of April 18, 2020, and the number of recovered patients began to outnumber new confirmed cases on March 14, 2020. The number of new cases dropped to fewer than 10 on April 19, 2020. The following section will examine how the Korean government responded to the sudden surge of COVID-19."", ""Learning Costly Lessons from Past Failure"": ""While the South Korean government has been considered an exemplary case in demonstrating effective and innovative responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, it experienced a painful failure in its initial response to and mitigation of MERS in 2015. According to a MERS white paper published by the Ministry of Health and Welfare (2016), South Korea had 186 infected patients and 38 deaths between May 20 and December 23, 2015, when the South Korean government officially declared the eradication of the outbreak. South Korea was second only to Saudi Arabia in terms of the number of infected patients. The first patient was reported to have been infected during a two-week trip to the Middle East at the end of April 2015. The patient visited several medical clinics before he was later diagnosed with MERS. Later, the number of confirmed cases began to increase through hospital infections as infected patients visited the hospital and were treated. Despite the surge of infected cases, the South Korean government initially did not disclose necessary information to the public, such as where the patients were hospitalized, to avoid any unnecessary fear among citizens and potential reputation damage to the hospitals. 4 This position of nontransparency caused public outcry as well as tensions with local governments that wanted to disclose related information. For example, the mayor of Seoul Metropolitan City criticized the central government's nontransparent stance and held an emergency briefing to release information about the infection paths of patients and exposed hospitals. Though this caused much friction between the central and local governments, this open information position of the Seoul Metropolitan Government was Source: Modified from Wu and Chow (2020) .Source: Worldometer, https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/ (accessed April 18, 2020). later accepted by the central government, and it allowed individual citizens to identify and assess their possible exposure to infected patients. In addition, many managerial and policy limitations were identified in the course of fighting MERS until the last quarantined patient was released on July 27, 2015. Later, the MERS white paper (Ministry of Health and Welfare 2016) was published to document key lessons and policy recommendations from the MERS experience so as not to forget the failure and to turn the painful experience into useful guidance in handling future similar cases.Based on these policy recommendations, the South Korean government upgraded the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) to a deputy-ministerial-level agency and strengthened its autonomy and professional specialties by increasing the number of epidemiological surveyors (Ministry of Health and Welfare 2016). The MERS experience was costly, but it provided a great organizational learning experience for the South Korean government, as the government acquired \""puzzling\"" and \""powering\"" capacities from the accumulated experience of managing the MERS outbreak under uncertain, urgent, and complex circumstances (Moynihan 2008) . The South Korean government's institutional learning was primarily based on reevaluation/assessment (puzzling) and reform (powering) (Moynihan 2008) , which enhanced the KCDC's autonomy and capacity and established procedural protocols to control and prevent new infectious diseases such as COVID-19. The South Korean government learned costly lessons from the MERS failure 5 that became the foundation for the current policy actions against COVID-19 (Normile 2020).The next section will discuss how the South Korean government responded to the COVID-19 outbreak and mitigated its unexpected surge. In particular, agile, adaptive, and transparent actions by the South Korean government, as well as evidence-based policy decisions and collaborative governance, were emphasized. This section also examines how citizens' participation in social distancing campaigns and voluntary quarantine was effective at mitigating COVID-19."", ""Agile and Adaptive Approach: Proactive and Massive Testing versus Herd Immunity"": ""The South Korean government introduced agile responses to possible infected cases based on thorough epidemiological surveys of each possible case. While some medical specialists argue that we should recognize that COVID-19 may eventually become a seasonal infectious disease like influenza, others claim that governments should take more aggressive measures to suppress transmission of infectious disease as much as possible. The former often supports a soft and somewhat passive approach, including moderate mitigation measures. For example, the U.K. prime minister at one point suggested that the country might need to wait until 60 percent of the people had been infected and obtained so-called herd immunity (Costello 2020) . Japan also appeared to take this approach. The latter is a hard approach, which often requires forceful and aggressive measures such as lockdowns, travel bans, and curfews, as was done in China. Many countries initially positioned themselves somewhere between two approaches but changed their positions as the situation worsened. For example, many European countries such as Italy and France shifted from a soft and passive approach toward a hard and aggressive approach.The South Korean government took a unique approach, which I call an agile-adaptive approach. South Korea proactively identified each infected case and exposed potential cases as fast as possible. This approach requires not only massive testing and quarantine of infected patients but also technological support to track their movements. In fact, the South Korean government tested more than 4,099 people per million from the beginning of the outbreak, while the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States tested 387, 76, and 26 people per million, respectively, as of March 9, 2020 (McCarthy 2020; Worldometer 2020). As of April 18, the South Korean government was testing about 10,000 people per million. 6 This massive preventive testing relied on a systematic epidemiological survey of each infected patient, which enabled governments to emulate the contagion speed with its suppression capacity by isolating and treating infected patients. Of course, this is only a feasible alternative in the early stages of a COVID-19 outbreak because it is almost impossible to have a complete epidemiological survey once the outbreak becomes a community contagion.Such a massive scale of testing was possible because the South Korean government was well prepared to conduct a large-scale epidemiological survey and quickly develop infectious disease testing kits by increasing the number of epidemiological professionals in the KCDC and local governments, as well as by promoting infectious disease research and development among academics and related medical communities in post-MERS policy actions. Several innovative practices, such as drive-through and walk-through testing stations, were quickly adopted, which helped not only shorten the testing time but also reduce potential infections in medical facilities, enhancing national testing capacity (Normile 2020) .This approach allowed the government to slow down the contagion speed and ease the spike of new infected cases. Similar to the notion of agile government (Deloitte 2017; DeSeve 2020; Moon 2017 Moon , 2019 , agile actions often require flexible organizational structure, increasing involvement of stakeholders and resources, and efficient decision-making processes for timely and transparent results. The South Korean government was adaptive and flexible in handling new situations and receptive to new ideas and alternative solutions under the uncertain circumstances, particularly in the course of the rapid surge of infected patients. For example, the South Korean government quickly sought alternative ways to handle new situations by using training centers and public institutions' facilities to accommodate infected but light-symptom patients and by adopting new methods to minimize hospital infections, such as drive-through and walk-through testing stations. This adaptative approach was largely possible because the South Korean government attempted to put \""science\"" over \""policy\"" (Comfort 2007 ) by making key initial disinfection decisions primarily based on scientific evidence and standard operating procedures established after the MERS incident of 2015, then adjusting its decisions based on inputs from the fields rather than political calculations.Countries that did not take an agile-adaptive approach later decided to increase testing and often introduced a hard approach such as lockdown, which was initially adopted by China and later by Western democratic countries such as Italy and France as they experienced uncontrollable massive surges. Unfortunately, countries often missed the golden time for the necessary thorough "", ""Figure 3 Hypothetical Curves of Public Trust in Transparent and Nontransparent Policies"": ""epidemiological survey-based effective mitigation, which forced them to take a hard approach. This indicates that South Korea's agile and adaptive approach with massive testing was an appropriate action to control the outbreak without extreme intervention measures such as aggressive lockdowns that forcibly constrained citizens' mobility. The majority of respondents to a national survey by the Institute of Future Government (2020) indicated that they felt positive about the South Korean government's action and preferred it to that of other countries."", ""Public Information and Transparency Policy for Trust Surplus"": ""One of the crucial lessons from the MERS failure was that governments should be open and transparent to the public. To actively communicate with citizens to increase their awareness of and engagement in anti-COVID-19 measures, the government provided all necessary information, including up-to-date statistics on infected cases and the fatality rate, as well as details of the movement path of each individual infected patient prior to being quarantined. In fact, citizens frequently received notifications from the government on where a new infected case was found and where the patient had been. In addition, apps were developed by the government as well as citizens that allowed citizens to track where the infected patients visited (e.g., Corona Map). 8 This was made possible thanks to many technological and legal supports that permitted data mining of CCTV footage, credit card use, and GPS information from the mobile phones of infected persons. As the country experienced a shortage of face masks, apps were also developed and provided to give information regarding the locations of drugstores and the number of face masks available in nearby drugstores.It should be noted that active information provision often raises concerns about infringement on the privacy of infected patients, even though their identities are not revealed. This is part of an ongoing debate on the trade-off between privacy and public safety. Regarding this debate, a recent national survey suggested that a majority of South Koreans (84.4 percent) preferred having transparent information provided by the government on the details of the movements of infected patients to withholding the information for the purpose of privacy protection (Institute of Future Government 2020). The survey also showed that a majority of respondents checked COVID-19 information multiple times a day: about 62 percent answered that they checked the information more than three times, and 34.3 percent answered that they checked one or two times a day. Despite the favorable reception of governments' uses of private information for the sake of public health interest, governments and citizens should constantly revisit the privacy-public interest trade-off and figure out how possible abuse of public authority and infringement on privacy can be monitored, prevented, and managed. This is an important issue whenever new technological solutions for COVID-19 tracking systems, such as Google's social distancing tracking systems, are developed and adopted. In fact, the privacypublic health interest trade-off was an important consideration when the South Korean government decided to introduce electronic wristbands to effectively enforce quarantine policies by monitoring and preventing violations of mandated quarantines.While the openness and transparency of the South Korean government about COVID-19 has been well received and trusted by citizens in general, it stirred citizens' fears and outrage in the initial stage. When a sudden surge of confirmed cases began with the Shincheonji-originated spike in the Daegu and Kyungbook regions, citizens were extremely disturbed, as they were shocked by the daily updated statistics showing the abrupt rise in the number of infections and deaths. Many were disappointed by the poor judgment and performance of the government, because President Moon Jae-in had mentioned that the COVID-19 was likely to be controlled sooner or later and asked citizens to prepare to go back to their routine life and socioeconomic recovery right before the unexpected surge in the Daegu and Kyungbook regions. It seemed that transparency initially caused some disturbance, fear, and distrust, but eventually it helped regain public trust and reduce unnecessary fear in the long run. Figure 3 shows the hypothetical effects of transparency and nontransparency policies on public trust in government (Moon 2020) . For example, a transparency policy might result in a trust deficit in the short run because the growing number of new infected patients is likely to cause citizens to experience fear and frustration about poor performance on infectious diseases, which tends to lower public trust in government. However, a policy of transparency eventually leads to a trust surplus in the long run because the public will then accept the government as a reliable source of information and come to trust government actions (Moon 2020) . Many believe that the South Korean government's position on transparency was effective risk communication because it helped build the credibility of the KCDC and filter fake news and rumors around COVID-19. In fact, 74.4 percent of respondents to a national survey answered that government information about COVID-19 was transparent, and more than 60 percent replied that they trust the government (Institute of Future Government 2020). In fact, the increased public trust in government, coinciding with President Moon's higher approval rating, eventually helped the ruling party clinch an unprecedented landslide victory in the National Assembly election on April 15, 2020. It should be noted that the transparency policy and trust surplus in Korea helped to facilitate citizens' cooperative participation in fighting against COVID-19 which is discussed in the following section."", ""Citizen Participation and Citizenship in Social Distancing"": ""According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2017), nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are critical Source: Moon (2020, 81) .in the effective management of any infectious diseases like influenza or COVID-19. In fact, NPIs such as social distancing and individual sanitization are considered the best ways to slow and prevent the spread of a virus when no vaccines or medicines are available (CDC 2017). The South Korean government also referred to public information campaigns (PICs) to promote NPIs for personal sanitization and social distancing through various channels, including conventional posts and placards, mass media, and new media. As noted by Weiss and Tschirhart (1994) in their analysis of 100 campaigns, PICs are an increasingly important and often very effective policy instrument, particularly when a government aims to communicate with a large target population without having any alternative forceful and regulatory measures or monetary incentives. Referring to massive PICs, South Korea effectively enhanced the level of awareness of COVID-19 and promoted voluntary actions for personal and public health.With the massive social distancing campaign and transparent policy stance by the South Korean government, the public was extremely cooperative and participated in social distancing as well as personal sanitization practices such as hand washing and wearing masks in public places. Voluntary quarantines of low-risk patients also helped reduce the number of new infected cases. Government actions could not have been effective if the public had not voluntarily cooperated with the NPIs. In particular, voluntary social distancing and selfquarantine of people in the Daegu-Kyungbook region enabled South Korea to effectively manage the massive regional cluster without lockdowns. This is an exemplary case that demonstrates the significance of citizens' voluntary participation and engagement in social distancing for effective COVID-19 mitigation. In fact, citizens' engagement and mature citizenship is as important as agile and adaptive actions of the government to the successful management of COVID-19.However, it is fair to note that South Korea, like many other countries, cannot always expect voluntary and mature citizenship. For example, South Korea initially experienced an unexpected shortage of face masks amid the COVID-19 outbreak, mainly because of rapidly growing fears of COVID-19 and illegal stockpiling, 9 similar to the stockpiling of toilet tissue, food, and hand sanitizer in many other countries. Responding to the great disturbance from the face mask shortage, the South Korean government decided to ration them to citizens, as had been done in Taiwan, which later helped alleviate citizens' outcry. PICs for social distancing and disease awareness are effective only when citizens are cooperative with responsible engagement and voluntary participation in campaigns that put temporary and reasonable constraints on individual freedom, such as quarantines. COVID-19 will remain a challenging problem in South Korea, considering the possible resurgence of COVID-19 (so-called black swans) through channels such as imported infections, hospital-acquired infections, and public facilities. This was seen in Singapore, where the number of confirmed patients dramatically spiked after the government decided to reopen schools and release social distancing guidelines."", ""Conclusions"": ""Public administration is being put to the test by COVID-19. Many countries are struggling with the choices of different approaches (a soft-passive approach based on herd immunity versus a hardforceful approach such as aggressive lockdowns versus an agile-adaptive approach) and policy instruments (testing, tracking, treatment, quarantines, PICs, app-based information sharing, social distancing, lockdowns, etc.) to mitigate this unprecedented wicked challenge. There are many alternative policy options on the table, from China's harsh complete blockage of the epicenter using the army and monitoring drones to Japan's soft and reactive measures without proactive testing and lockdown. Some argue that many Western democratic countries are paying a high price for their open and free society, where methods such as China's sudden and complete blockage option are not likely to be easily accepted (Perez-Pena 2020), while the linkage between culture and quality of government has been studied (Porcher forthcoming).As some European countries failed in initial mitigation, they gradually shifted from a soft and reactive approach to a hard and more aggressive approach by increasing their testing capacity, forcing quarantines, and ordering partial lockdowns while they put more emphasis on citizens' cooperation in NPIs. Although there is no perfect policy, the South Korean government's agile, adaptive, and transparent approaches demonstrate how the wicked pandemic problem could be mitigated with citizens' voluntary engagement in the fight against COVID-19. Governments should quickly learn from the initial COVID-19 failure. Governments also need to build on administrative and policy capacities to minimize any potential damage and to prepare for future wicked challenges with minimal disruption of quality of life in free and open democratic societies, the same way that South Korea learned from the costly lessons of the MERS failure.COVID-19 requires both scholars and practitioners to revisit key public administration issues such as government and market, science and policy, administrative and societal capacities, public leadership and citizen participation, policy instruments and instrument choices, local problems and global problems, and policy failure and organizational learning, heuristics and rational decisions, and agility and effectiveness. We should continue to pay attention to the development of COVID-19 and conduct comparative studies of approaches adopted by different countries to the same wicked problem. Finally, governments should continue to search for alternative ways of managing uncertainties and complexities through evidence-based heuristics as well as strong governmental and societal capacities to prepare for future wicked policy problems."", ""Notes"": ""institutional memories, and standard operating procedures established during the MERS case in 2015, enabling swift and decisive action.6.

This article discusses the compelling challenges posed by the COVID‐19 pandemic by examining how this wicked problem has been managed by the South Korean government with agile‐adaptive, transparent actions to mitigate the surge of COVID‐19. Unlike many Western countries, South Korea has been able to contain the spread of COVID‐19 without a harsh forced lockdown of the epicenter of the virus. This essay argues that an agile‐adaptive approach, a policy of transparency in communicating risk, and citizens’ voluntary cooperation are critical factors. It also suggests that the South Korean government learned costly lessons from the MERS failure of 2015.

However, these two pathogens are easily mixed with other pathogens, and thus can aggravate diseases. More recently, it was reported that C. psittaci and H9N2 often cause mixed infections in clinic. Our previous study found that C. psittaci infection increases the mortality of avian influenza virus H9N2 by suppressing the host immune response [15] . In addition, coinfection of C. psittaci with H9N2, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT), and Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) contributes to severe pneumonia and a high mortality in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens, explaining why severe avian airsacculitis is prevalent in the winter season in northern China [16] .Macrophages play critical roles in innate and adaptive immunity against chlamydial infections. The depletion of macrophages from mice prior to infection with Chlamydia muridarum (C. muridarum) and C. psittaci results in increased morbidity and pathogen burdens [17, 18] . Macrophage activities may not contribute to pathogen clearance, because C. psittaci is able to survive and deliver to other tissues by using the macrophage as a \""vehicle\"" [19] . Macrophages activated by interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or other microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are associated with increased mortality of macrophages, nitric oxide (NO) production, secretions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and pro-inflammatory cytokines [20] . In this study, we illustrate the pathogenic mechanism of coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 in the chicken macrophage cell line HD11. Based on previous animal studies, we postulate that C. psittaci infection might be beneficial for the replication of H9N2 in HD11 macrophages by impairing the macrophage functions."", ""Cells and Virus"": ""The chicken macrophage HD11 cells were kindly provided by Prof. Jian Qiao (College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China). HD11 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco, United States) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, United States), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin (Gibco, United States) at pH 7.2, and were kept at 37 \u2022 C with 5% carbon oxide (CO 2 ). The Buffalo Green Monkey (BGM) cell-adapted C. psittaci 6BC strain used in the current study was housed in our laboratory. The C. psittaci 6BC standard strain was kindly provided by Prof. Yimou Wu (Institute of Pathogenic Biology, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan Province, China) and the AIV H9N2/chicken/Shandong/2011 was isolated from broilers as described previously [21] . The susceptibility of HD11 cells to C. psittaci and H9N2 was measured by morphological changes, growth curves using 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID 50 ), and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA)."", ""Virus and Bacteria Titration"": ""The H9N2 AIV (H9N2/chicken/Shandong/2011) chicken embryo allantoic fluid was diluted 1000 times; then, 9~11-day-old SPF chicken embryos were inoculated with 0.2 mL and incubated in 37 \u2022 C incubators. After 24 h, the dead chicken embryos were abandoned and the rest were incubated for 48 h in the thermostat. After being at 4 \u2022 C refrigerators overnight, the chicken embryo uranic fluid was tested under aseptic conditions, and the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) titers was measured-it was \u2265 7.0 (log 2 ) in the uranic solution and saved at \u221280 \u2022 C. Here, TCID 50 was applied to the HD11 cells to quantitate the virus titers, as described previously [22] . The HD11 cells were cultured in 96-well plates, and 10-fold dilutions of the virus were prepared in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. The cultured cells were infected with the virus and then observed daily for cytopathic effects (CPE). The final virus titers were calculated by the Reed-Muench method to be 10 3.86 TCID 50 /mL.As for C. psittaci, the BGM cells were seeded on round coverslips and cultured in growth medium consisting of minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). Ten-fold dilutions of the inoculum were centrifuged at 3400\u00d7 g for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C, and then incubated for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C. The growth medium was subsequently replaced by serum-free medium. After 48 h of incubation, the cells were fixed in absolute methanol for 10 min. Chlamydial inclusions were detected by direct immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), diluted 1:5 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), at pH 7.4 (Imagen Chlamydia, Oxoid, France). The number of inclusion-forming units (IFU) per mL was assessed by counting the total number of inclusions on the whole coverslip of a countable inoculum dilution. A final titer of 4.05 \u00d7 10 8 IFU/mL was determined for the inoculum."", ""Experimental Design"": ""The HD11 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, seeded in a six-well cell culture plate at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 10 6 per well, and then kept at 37 \u2022 C with 5% CO 2 for 24 h. The coinfection group cells were infected with C. psittaci and H9N2 simultaneously. The C. psittaciand H9N2-only infection groups were only infected with C. psittaci or H9N2, respectively. The infection doses of the two pathogens were both at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)."", ""Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR"": ""The total RNA was isolated using TRIzol agent (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China), and each RNA sample was reverse-transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) by the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China). cDNA was used for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. The sets of primer pairs of the two pathogens and of the nitric oxide synthase genes are listed in Table 1 , and the primer pairs of cytokines can be found in Nang et al.'s paper [23] . For qRT-PCR reactions, the 25 \u00b5L reaction mixture included 2 \u00b5L cDNA, 12.5 \u00b5L SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM II (Takara, Beijing, China), 1.0 \u00b5L of forward primer and 1.0 \u00b5L of reverse primer, and 8.5 \u00b5L RNAase-free water (Takara, Beijing, China). The reaction conditions were 95 \u2022 C for 3 min, followed by 44 cycles of 95 \u2022 C for 10 s, then the specific melting temperature (Tm) of a primer pair for 30 s, and then 95 \u2022 C for 10 s and 72 \u2022 C for 10 s, using a Bio-Rad IQ5 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was selected as a reference gene. The expression fold changes were calculated using the 2 \u2212 Ct method [24] . "", ""Determination of Cell Mortality"": ""Cell mortality was detected by a CellTox Green Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Promega, Wisconsin, United States). The detection system uses a proprietary asymmetric cyanine dye, which is blocked by living cells but can stain the DNA of dead cells. When the dye binds with DNA, it emits fluorescence. Therefore, the fluorescence signal produced by the dye bound to the dead cell DNA is directly proportional to the cytotoxicity. We operated strictly according to the protocol, adding 50 \u00b5L cells with a concentration of 1 \u00d7 10 5 /mL to the 96-well cell culture plate. Then, we added 100 \u00b5L CellTox TM Green reagent (Madison, WI, USA), and after incubation for 15 min, it was put into a fluorescence enzyme labeling instrument. After 1 min of simple oscillation, the fluorescence signal value was detected at 485-500 nm Ex/520~530 nm Em wavelength. "", ""Determination of iNOS Activity"": ""The inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity was detected by a Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) Activity Assay Kit (BioVision, SMB, Milpitas, CA, United States). Briefly, we added 100-200 \u00b5L cold NOS Assay Buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail to fresh cells (2-5 \u00d7 10 6 ), which was then homogenized to disrupt the cells. The tissue or cell homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7 g and 4 \u2022 C for 10 min. The clarified supernatant was transferred to a fresh pre-chilled tube and kept on ice. The protein concentration was measured, and the lysates were used immediately to assay NOS activity. Then, 30-60 \u00b5L (200-400 \u00b5g protein) of cell/tissue homogenate or purified protein was measured into the desired wells in a 96-well plate. For the positive control, NOS enzyme was diluted 1:20 in NOS Dilution Buffer just before use. Next, 5-10 \u00b5L of the diluted NOS enzyme was added into the desired well(s), and the volume of the sample and the positive control wells were made up to 60 \u00b5L/well with the NOS Assay Buffer. Enough reaction mixes for the number of wells (standards, positive control, and sample) were prepared to be analyzed, which were then mixed well and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h. After incubation, 90 \u00b5L of NOS Assay Buffer was added to the standard, positive control, and sample wells, and subsequently 5 \u00b5L of the enhancer was added into each well, which were then mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. After this, 50 \u00b5L of Griess Reagent 1 and 50 \u00b5L of Griess Reagent 2 were added to the standard, positive control, and sample wells, which were then mixed and incubated for 10 min, before the absorbance (540 nm) was read using a microplate reader. The nitrite standard curve was plotted and the iNOS activity calculated according to the formula: sample iNOS activity = nitrite amount in sample well from standard curve/(reaction time \u00d7 amount of protein) = pmol/min/\u00b5g = mU/mg."", ""Nitrite Quantification"": ""Nitrite levels were determined by colorimetric assay based on the Griess reaction (Beyotime, Haimen, Jiangsu Province, China), using sodium nitrite standards. Briefly, 100 \u00b5L of cell-free pretreated supernatant was mixed with 100 \u00b5L of Griess reagent, and after 10 min, the absorbance was measured at 540 nm wavelength. Using a standard curve, the absorbance of the samples was converted to micromolar nitric oxide (NO)."", ""Detection of Cell Phagocytosis"": ""The phagocytosis of macrophages was detected by a fluorescein-labeled Escherichia coli K-12 BioParticles of Vybrant Phagocytosis Assay Kit (ThermoFisher, MA, United States). Briefly, 100 \u00b5L of the prepared fluorescent BioParticle suspension was added to all the negative control, positive control, and experimental wells, and incubated for 2 h. The BioParticle was removed and 100 \u00b5L of the prepared trypan blue suspension was immediately added to all wells, before incubating for 1 min at room temperature. The experimental and control wells of the microplate were read in the fluorescence plate reader using~480 nm excitation,~520 nm emission, and the appropriate sensitivity settings. The net phagocytosis and the response to the phagocytosis effector agent were then calculated. First, the average fluorescence intensity of a group of negative control wells was subtracted from that of a group of positive control wells to yield the net positive reading. Second, the average fluorescence intensity of a group of negative-control wells was subtracted from that of a group of identical experimental wells to obtain the net experimental reading.

Our major finding was that coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 could significantly aggravate the mortality of HD11 cells compared to the effects of infection with C. psittaci or H9N2 alone. Moreover, the iNOS expression and enzyme activity, as well as NO concentration, of HD11 cells were significantly reduced compared to those of C. psittaci or H9N2 alone. In other words, coinfection of C. psittaci with H9N2 could stimulate HD11 cells to express less iNOS and NO compared to infection with H9N2 alone. In addition, coinfection of C. psittaci and H9N2 induced lower phagocytosis of HD11 cells than H9N2 or C. psittaci alone at 24 hpi. Furthermore, both the mRNA expression and cytokine levels of IL-4 and IL-10 were significantly increased at 24 hpi in the C. psittaci + H9N2 group. On the contrary, the Th1 cytokines of IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, and IL-6 were significantly increased in the C. psittaci + H9N2 group compared to those of C. psittaci or H9N2 alone at the early stage. Later, only TNF-\u03b1 secretions were increased significantly compared to those of the C. psittaci group at 24 hpi. All the above data support our hypothesis that C. psittaci infection could aggravate the infection of H9N2 by impairing macrophage functions, leading to the outbreak of severe respiratory diseases.In our previous study, we established an SPF chicken animal model with coinfection of C. psittaci and H9N2, and we found that C. psittaci infection increased the mortality of H9N2 by inhibiting humoral immunity and cellular immunity, as well as by altering the Th1/Th2 balance, ultimately weakening the immune system of the body [15] . It was the first report that C. psittaci infection can induce immune suppression in vivo and can lead to increased susceptibility to H9N2 infection. It also suggested that we should consider primary infection by C. psittaci in any respiratory disease, and should eradicate it during the treatment of avian respiratory disease. In addition, other studies have also reported the role of C. psittaci and H9N2 in the pathogenesis of coinfection. In this sense, coinfection is a common infection of two or more pathogens in the same host. Similar coinfection occurs frequently in human cases. For example, in 1918, in the human influenza virus pandemic, almost all cases of death were caused by bacteria mixed infection, and the additional bacterial infection greatly increased the risk of death [25] . Moreover, the combination of malaria and helminth is prevalent in less-developed countries [26] . Hence, identifying the primary pathogen of the mixed infection has been underestimated due to limited investigation. Traditionally, low pathogenic avian influenza virus triggers primary infection, and then the secondary infection of bacteria follows [27] . Since 2007, the outbreak of avian airsacculitis has been documented by the mixed infection of various pathogens [28] .In our study, coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 increased the mortality of HD11 cells in comparison with C. psittaci or H9N2 alone. Simultaneous infection with C. psittaci and H9N2 was able to increase the mortality of HD11 cells by decreasing iNOS activity and phagocytosis, indicating that coinfection might impair macrophage functions and facilitate the immune evasions of the two pathogens. Our discoveries are consistent with a previous report that showed macrophage functions were damaged post-infection with virulent C. psittaci [19] .Macrophages play an important role in innate immunity, such as phagocytosis, antiviral infection, and enhanced immune regulation. Pathogens infect the body and the monocytes after infection of the main target cells. After entering macrophages, Chlamydia can escape immune surveillance and transport to the whole body with macrophages, and thus macrophages act as the delivery system for Chlamydia [19] . Therefore, it is necessary to study how macrophages play a role in the host's immune response to the pathogen, as well as the pathogenesis of the pathogen, after the study of Chlamydia and H9N2 infection. The inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene and its activity have been shown to be involved in the reaction of L-arginine decomposition into NO and L-citrulline. Endotoxin or cytokines, such as LPS and IFN-\u03b3, can induce chicken macrophages to produce iNOS, and to further produce NO [29] . Our research shows that coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 could significantly decrease the iNOS expression level and enzyme activity, as well as the NO concentration, of HD11 cells compared to H9N2 or C. psittaci infection alone. However, the potential mechanism is unknown. The monocyte macrophage system has the function of phagocytosis and the killing of pathogens and tumor cells directly. In our study, we found that coinfection induced lower phagocytosis of HD11 cells compared to H9N2 infection. All this evidence illustrates the mechanism of macrophage dysfunction post-coinfection or after C. psittaci infection alone. Cytokines secreted by macrophages are also important components of their immune regulation. Here, several pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines were determined by mRNA expression and ELISA cytokine kits. The role of Th1/Th2 cell cytokines is important in the immune response to chlamydial infection. It appears that the Th1 CD4 cell response plays a dominant role in protective immunity, while Th2 CD4 cytokines (particularly IL-10) play a role in the immunopathology of chlamydial infection. Products of Th2 cells do not facilitate the production of IFN-\u03b3 or inhibit Chlamydia growth [30] . TNF-\u03b1 regulates critical cell functions, including cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and apoptosis. Macrophages are the major producers of TNF-\u03b1, and TNF-\u03b1 has been shown to play a pivotal role in orchestrating the cytokine cascade in many inflammatory diseases [31] . Increased TNF-\u03b1 levels have been associated with atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease post-infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) [32] . IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine known to play a critical role in chronic infections caused by intra-cellular organisms. During chlamydial infection, high IL-10 secretion was shown to be associated with pathogenesis in a mouse model of Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) infection [33] . In the present study, high TNF-\u03b1 production was induced by coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2, and this might be associated with increasing the increased mortality of the HD11 cells. In our results, the expression of IL-4 and IL-10 were increased significantly in the coinfection groups, suggesting that chlamydial infection mediated the polarization of Th1/Th2 to the Th2 direction. The dominant role of Th2 cytokines hampers immune function, so that pathogens can evade immune surveillance and immune attacks. The Th2 polarization was consistent with our previous data, implying that immune suppression is aggravated post-artificial infection with H9N2 and C. psittaci [15] .In conclusion, coinfection often increases disease severity in both humans and animals. Understanding the mechanisms and effects of coinfection will improve the understanding of the mechanism of mixed infection. In this study, the macrophage functions were exacerbated by reducing phagocytosis post-coinfection. Also, the polarization of IL-4 and IL-10 expressions might contribute to macrophage dysfunction and facilitate H9N2 circulations by reducing virus clearance in host cells. In addition, further findings of this study show that not only does C. psittaci aggravate H9N2 infection, but H9N2 can also increase the mortality caused by C. psittaci infection. Whether this is beneficial to the infection and spread of C. psittaci remains to be confirmed. These findings suggest that we should consider the primary and latent infection of C. psittaci in respiratory disease and should eradicate C. psittaci during treatment."", ""Conclusions"": ""In conclusion, coinfection often increases disease severity in both humans and animals. Understanding the mechanisms and effects of coinfection will improve the understanding of the common pathogenicity mechanisms. Since 2007, severe respiratory infections and avian airsacculitis in chickens in many parts of China have been the result of coinfection with bacteria and viruses. The role of viral-bacterial coinfection in animal-to-human transmission of infectious agents has not received enough attention, and should be emphasized in future investigations. We have established a SPF chicken model of coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 in vivo. At this point, it is urgent to continue to study cell models of coinfection of C. psittaci and H9N2 in vitro. In this study, we did such work and found that infection with C. psittaci will increase the replication of H9N2, decrease the iNOS-NO pathway, and raise the IL-6 and IL-10 expression of HD11 cells by H9N2 infection. At the same time, C. psittaci infection can also reduce the phagocytosis of macrophages. Like the results of previous animal models, we found that C. psittaci can reduce the function of immune cells in many ways, thus aggravating the susceptibility of H9N2. In addition, the further findings of this study are that not only does C. psittaci aggravate H9N2 infection, but also H9N2 can increase the mortality caused by C. psittaci infection. Whether this is beneficial to the infection and spread of C. psittaci remain to Animals 2020, 10, 722 13 of 14 be confirmed.

H9N2 influenza virus, a low pathogenic avian influenza viruses’ subtype, has become endemic in different types of domestic poultry in lots of countries, resulting in great economic loss due to reduced egg production or high mortality associated with coinfection with other pathogens. These two pathogens are easily mixed with other pathogens to aggravate the disease, and often cause mixed infection in clinics. Co-infection of C. psittaci with H9N2 commonly induces severe pneumonia and high mortality in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. According to previous studies, we postulated that C. psittaci infection may beneficial for the replication of H9N2 in HD11. Consequently, in this study, we clarify the pathogenic mechanism of coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 in the chicken macrophage cell line HD11, which is the first study of the coinfection of C. psittaci and H9N2 in vitro. ABSTRACT: In a pilot study, simultaneous infection with Chlamydia psittaci (C. psittaci) and H9N2 virus induced 20% mortality and severe avian airsacculitis, shedding light on animal models of poultry respiratory diseases. However, the pathogenesis is still unclear. In the current study, we hypothesized that C. psittaci infection execrates macrophage function and facilitates H9N2 infection. To explore the potential mechanism, we studied the effect of C. psittaci and H9N2 on the functions of HD11 cells in vitro by simultaneous infection of C. psittaci and H9N2. At the same time, we used infection with C. psittaci or H9N2 alone as the control groups. The results showed that coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 could significantly aggravate the mortality of HD11 cells compared to C. psittaci or H9N2 infection alone. In addition, coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 did not induce high C. psittaci loads compared to C. psittaci infection alone at 12- and 24-hours post-inoculation (hpi), but coinfection with C. psittaci and H9N2 could increase the loads of H9N2 compared to H9N2 alone in HD11 cells at 12 hpi. More importantly, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression levels, enzyme activity, nitric oxide (NO) production, and phagocytosis were reduced significantly in the group with C. psittaci and H9N2 coinfection compared to those of H9N2 or C. psittaci alone at 24 hpi. Finally, C. psittaci infection induced robust expressions of type Th2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, while interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) displayed a significant decrease compared to H9N2 infection alone at 24 hpi. All the above data indicate that C. psittaci infection can facilitate H9N2 invasion and to aggravate severe avian airsacculitis by impairing macrophage functions.",10.3390/ani10040722,PMC,PMC7222846,32326284.0,cc-by,2020-04-21,Animals (Basel),,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222846/,2020.0,paper

This knowledge was neglected in European veterinary medicine for decades but kept alive by farmers. Emergence of multidrug resistant bacterial strains requires a severely restricted use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine. We conducted a survey on the ethnoveterinary knowledge of farmers in the bilingual (French and German speaking) Western region of Switzerland, namely the cantons of Fribourg, Neuchâtel and Jura, and in the French speaking part of the canton of Bern. AIM OF THE STUDY: To find out whether differences exist in plants used by farmers in French speaking and bilingual regions of Switzerland as compared to our earlier studies conducted in Switzerland. Additional focus was on plants that are used in diseases which commonly are treated with antimicrobials, on plants used in skin afflictions, and on plants used in animal species such as horses, for which the range of veterinary medicinal products is limited. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted in 2015 semistructured interviews with 62 dialog partners, mainly cattle keeping farmers but also 18 horse keeping farmers. Of these, 41 were native French (FNS) and 21 native German speakers (GNS). Detailed information about homemade herbal remedies (plant species, plant part, manufacturing process) and the corresponding use reports (target animal species, category of use, route of administration, dosage, source of knowledge, frequency of use, last time of use and farmers satisfaction) were collected. RESULTS: A total of 345 homemade remedies were reported, of which 240 contained only one plant species (Homemade Single Species Herbal Remedy Reports; HSHR). A total of 289 use reports (UR) were mentioned for the 240 HSHR, and they comprised 77 plant species belonging to 41 botanical families. Of these, 35 plant species were solely reported from FNS, 20 from GNS, and 22 from both. Taking into account earlier ethnoveterinary studies conducted in Switzerland only 10 (FNS) and 6 (GNS) plant species connected with 7% of FNS and GNS UR respectively were “unique” to the respective language group. The majority of the UR (219) was for treatment of cattle, while 38 UR were intended to treat horses. The most UR were for treatment of gastrointestinal and skin diseases. The most frequently mentioned plants were Linum usitatissimum L., Coffea L., Matricaria chamomilla L., Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze, and Quercus robur L. for gastrointestinal diseases, and Calendula officinalis L., Hypericum perforatum L. and Sanicula europaea L. for skin afflictions. CONCLUSION: No clear differences were found between the medicinal plants used by French native speakers and German native speakers. Several of the reported plants seem to be justified to widen the spectrum of veterinary therapeutic options in gastrointestinal and dermatological disorders in cattle and horses, and to reduce, at least to a certain degree, the need for antibiotic treatments. Our findings may help to strengthen the role of medicinal plants in veterinary research and practice, and to consider them as a further measure in official strategies for lowering the use of antibiotics.",10.1016/j.jep.2019.112184,Elsevier; Medline; PMC,PMC7185669,31465817.0,no-cc,2020-01-10,J Ethnopharmacol,,,,201674533.0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874119322767; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874119322767; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.112184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31465817/,2020.0,paper

A clear example of a perceived danger associated with bats is the theme of the movie Contagion by S. Soderbergh, in which the chain of contagion of a deadly virus in the human population starts from bats and pigs after the disturbance of a bat colony due to deforestation [2] . If these conflicting perceptions are widespread among the general public who do not have close contact with bats, we aimed to investigate the perception of scientists studying bats who have greater knowledge and frequent interactions with them. Basically, this addresses the fact that knowledge on these aspects can facilitate rational evaluation and analysis of risks to public health. As a consequence this should provide scientists and science communicators adequate material to modify the norms shaping the publics' views on bats. We specifically aimed to explore the perception of bats among scientists in relation to their potential roles as reservoir hosts of zoonotic diseases. Bats are often associated with the emergence of pathogens [3, 4] , which has created a negative impact in the public. However, it is expected that knowledge dispels fear in the scientific community or that several research experts view bats only in terms of infection, risk, and danger. Thus, the presentation of bats varies widely among scientists, as epidemiologists may choose frightening pictures of bats [5] , while biological conservationists may choose appealing ones [6] . Obviously, this remains highly subjective. Through questioning scientists who mainly study bats, our aim was to determine (1) how scientists perceive their object of study, (2) how they perceive the representation of bats in the media and by the general public, (3) how they protect themselves and others against pathogen infections in their research practices, and (4) the causes that may explain the ongoing decline in bat populations worldwide. Overall the results of this study should help creating integrated educational programmes aimed at protecting bats and their ecosystems, as well as humans living in their vicinity. This requires an approach that is able to deliver a mixed message to conciliate issues related to bat conservation and ecosystem protection, while ensuring proper information on infectious risk transmission and thus public health."", ""Material and Methods"": ""A 29-question survey was designed, with most questions related to the location, nationality, type of research, research practices, the researcher's own perception of bats, as well as their views on the general public perception on bats. We also included a quiz to test the researcher's knowledge regarding bats and the role of bats as reservoir hosts of pathogens, as well as a series of questions related to the causes of the global decline in bat populations. These detailed questions and responses are available in the S1 File.The questionnaire was sent to the corresponding authors of one or more scientific papers published between 2010 and 2014 that were referenced in the database ISI Web of Science as related to Chiroptera. The choice was based on the occurrence of a series of combined keywords (see S2 File). References were then checked to avoid the selection of unrelated publications. Once the duplicates were removed, the questionnaire was sent out to valid email addresses. When the same email address was found for several publications in different years, the most recent one was retained and the others were discarded. The questionnaire was sent through the online survey platform QuestionPro (http://www.questionpro.com/) to 2,180 potential participants in May 2015 and was closed in June 2015 after three reminders had been sent. Statistical analyses were performed using R software [7] and model selection was performed with the use of the package glmulti [8] . A total of 610 completed responses were received, accounting for an average response rate of 27.98%. We obtained the following increasing response rates from 2010 to 2014: 17.8% (51/287), 22.8% (88/386), 24.9% (96/386), 29.6% (170/574), and 37.5% (205/546). From the total responses, 23 were from researchers who declared they were not working on bats, with 587 responses remaining that contained usable answers for further analysis.The survey was performed in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration [9] , i.e. all participants were informed about the aim of the questionnaire and were free not to participate or to withdraw at any stage of the process. Responses were analysed in an anonymous manner."", ""A worldwide distribution"": ""As illustrated in S1 Fig, respondents showed a worldwide distribution in their research activities on bats, with Eurasian (18.6%) and North American (16.1%) regions being the most represented."", ""Type of research"": ""Research on bats represented an average of 55.7% \u00b1 1.4 of the research activities of our studied population, with these activities being divided as follows: field activities (30.0% \u00b1 1.0), laboratory studies (19.4% \u00b1 0.9), and desk activities (51.7% \u00b1 1.1) (Q2 and Q21). The most extensively studied bat family was Vespertilionidae, followed by Molossidae ( "", ""Perception of bats"": ""Although 96.3% of the scientists did not perceive bats as dangerous animals, several factors can lead to differences in this perception, i.e. studying the physiology of bats as well as bat infections were the likely reasons why bats were considered dangerous animals by the responders whereas this is the opposite when studying their ecology (Table 1) .The trend differed when scientists were asked about their views on the general public perceptions of bats, as a majority of the respondents (70.8%) believe that lay-people perceive bats as dangerous animals. Statistical analysis reveals that several factors might explain this perception (Table 2) . Thus, scientists involved in laboratory-orientated research are more likely to share this public perception, whereas those studying ethology, conservation, or bat infections are less likely to share the perception that bats are dangerous animals.Similarly, 36.8% of the laboratory-oriented scientists considered that the general population preferred bats over rats, while 40.9% of the field-oriented scientists believed that the general population considered bats similar to rats. Such differences may be explained by the negative representation of bats in the media (Fig 2) . A large proportion of scientists (approximately 40%) declared that bats are presented as frightening in the media; however, scientists who chose 'Other' (nearly 25%) as their response declared that the manner in which bats are portrayed in the media is inaccurate, misleading, and varying. Table 1 With regard to the consumption of bats, only 10 respondents in our survey declared that they had consumed bats, although it did not constitute a food habit. The opinions about the consumption of bats were quite diverse and appeared to rely on respondents' views on bat conservation as well as on culinary taste \""De gustibus non est disputandum\"" [10] ."", ""Bats and pathogens"": ""Scientists who do not study bat infections disagree with the putative role of bats as reservoir hosts for pathogens presented in the quiz, except for rabies and, to a lesser extent, the Hendra virus. However, knowledge about bats being potential reservoir hosts for rabies and the Hendra virus was equally shared and highly widespread among the respondents (Fig 3) . We introduced the avian flu H5N1 in our quiz on bats as potential reservoir hosts of pathogens and few scientists responded incorrectly by classifying it as potential virus carried by bats. A large proportion of scientists (46%) working on infection in bats disagree that bats were a reservoir of H5N1. A large fraction of the respondents in both groups (47.3% of the group studying infection and 75.6% of the other group) declared that they disagreed that bats can be reservoir hosts of the bat influenza virus H17N10 [11] . In addition, 48.6% to 58.3% of the researchers studying bats (but not their infections) disagreed that bats could be reservoir hosts of viruses such as Ebola, Nipah, and SARS-CoV. We also questioned scientists about the use of personal protective equipment while manipulating live bats as well as while collecting samples from live bats. When manipulating live bats, a majority of scientists responded that they always or very often wore personal protective equipment (Fig 4) . Researchers studying bat infection always used personal protective equipment, especially disposable gloves, safety goggles, safety glasses or face shields when manipulating live bats. A similar trend was observed among researchers manipulating samples collected from live bats (Fig 5) . Multiple correspondence analysis on the use of personal protective equipment for the manipulation of live bats as well as while collecting samples from live bats revealed that the frequency of using one type of personal protective equipment was highly predictive of the use of another type, especially when studying bat infections. In other words, if the researcher regularly used disposable overshoes, then they also frequently used a surgical cap (S4 File) during their research activities."", ""Bats, conservation, and biodiversity"": ""Worldwide bat populations are declining [12, 13] due to several factors [14] . According to the respondents of our survey, deforestation and intensive agriculture are the major detrimental factors followed by urbanisation and climate change (Fig 6) . We conducted logistic regression on the ranking of these factors by respondents (S3 File). Deforestation ranked high on the list of causes responsible for the decline of bat populations appears clearly related to working directly with live bats or samples taken from live bats. Similarly, high ranking of intensive agriculture is related to a low percentage of laboratory activities, manipulation of samples, and research activities in the field of conservation. Surprisingly, studying live bats appears to be related to low ranking of intensive agriculture; however, this was likely due to an association with deforestation and intensive agriculture being ranked as the major factors of the global decline of bats."", ""Discussion"": ""Overall, our survey reveals several important aspects. First, it appears that the idea of the danger associated with bats is not uniform within the scientific community studying them. Scientists can be classified into two categories: laboratory-oriented versus field-oriented, or as epidemiologists versus non-epidemiologists. The perceptions of scientists on bats appear to clearly depend on their main research activities and their contact with bats, and their internal tissues and/or blood, either in the laboratory or in the wild.The idea behind the danger associated with bats might be related to the relative lack of information regarding several diseases transmitted through bats. Thus, it is important to improve communication amongst scientists and to circulate accurate information within the scientific community. There are numerous popular misconceptions associated with bats [15] . Thus, bats are often affiliated with self-reported phobias, as are snakes and mice [16] , and they are highly ranked among the animals for which people have the feeling of disgust [17, 18] . Bats are also associated with vampires and blood drinking, as was shown in a survey in Slovakia that revealed that 20% of the college students believed that most bats drink blood, while in reality only three species do [19] . This lack of knowledge is particularly crucial when explaining the fear or reluctance people might have towards bats; therefore, better knowledge on the real level of infectious risks associated with bats would be helpful, especially for any conservation approach [20, 21] . If this is valid in professionals working closely with bats, accurate information on bat biology might also help the public to better understand the biology of bats and their roles in ecosystems. Such a trend has already been observed among students in Slovakia, where increased knowledge about bats is positively associated with a positive perspective [19] and improvement in the perception of bats is having a positive impact on efforts towards their conservation, at least in a population that has an interest in bats [15] . This would also be valid for any programme aimed at protecting wildlife that is often portrayed as the source of emerging infectious diseases [22] .Conflicting views exist on the management of bat populations in terms of conservation and public health. As mentioned previously, by investigating the perception of bats by scientific experts, our survey highlights heterogeneity regarding the perception of bats among a wellinformed community of specialists. These results should be compared with other surveys conducted on local communities and stakeholders. It is essential to elucidate how bats are perceived in order to develop adequate communication tools aimed at protecting bats and their ecosystems, as well as humans living in their vicinity. This requires an approach that is able to deliver a mixed message to conciliate issues related to bat conservation and ecosystem protection, while ensuring proper information on infectious risk transmission and thus public health are also stated [21] .The association between bats and the danger of pathogen transmission often exists and our study clearly reveals the widespread use of personal protective equipment against infection, especially by scientists studying infection in bats. This is a positive aspect in terms of work safety as well as for public health in order to avoid the spread of an eventual bat pathogen in the human population. Apart from the obvious advantages that the use of adequate protection by scientists facilitates the effective manipulation of bats; however, the white nose syndrome in bats caused by Pseudogymnoascus destructans can also be transmitted by humans through their clothes and gear as they move from one cave to another [23, 24] . Given the fact that 20% of the scientists in our survey have declared that they are currently studying P. destructans, it is important that these scientists should take precautions to not transmit infections among themselves or in the bat colonies they are studying.Our study clearly reveals that scientists consider that environmental modifications by humans-direct, such as deforestation and intensive agriculture, or indirect, such as climate change-are the major factors causing worldwide decline in bat population [25, 26] . This clearly highlights the human role on a worldwide scale and emphasises the need for ecosystem protection in conservation programmes.Finally, a large majority of scientists associate the general population as having a negative perception about bats. Based on this fact, it would also be highly informative to measure the level of public engagement of the respondents of our survey (e.g. interacting with a non-scientific audience, show-casing the relevance of their research, creating awareness, etc.), and the impact it could have on supporting measures that favour the conservation of bat populations. ""}",Bats and Academics: How Do Scientists Perceive Their Object of Study?,"Bats are associated with conflicting perceptions among humans, ranging from affection to disgust. If these attitudes can be associated with various factors among the general public (e.g. social norms, lack of knowledge), it is also important to understand the attitude of scientists who study bats. Such reflexive information on the researchers community itself could indeed help designing adequate mixed communication tools aimed at protecting bats and their ecosystems, as well as humans living in their vicinity that could be exposed to their pathogens. Thus, we conducted an online survey targeting researchers who spend a part of their research activity studying bats. Our aim was to determine (1) how they perceive their object of study, (2) how they perceive the representation of bats in the media and by the general population, (3) how they protect themselves against pathogen infections during their research practices, and (4) their perceptions of the causes underlying the decline in bat populations worldwide. From the 587 completed responses (response rate of 28%) having a worldwide distribution, the heterogeneity of the scientists’ perception of their own object of study was highlighted. In the majority of cases, this depended on the type of research they conducted (i.e. laboratory versus field studies) as well as their research speciality. Our study revealed a high level of personal protection equipment being utilised against pathogens during scientific practices, although the role bats play as reservoirs for a number of emerging pathogens remains poorly known. Our results also disclosed the unanimity among specialists in attributing a direct role for humans in the global decline of bat populations, mainly via environmental change, deforestation, and agriculture intensification. Overall, the present study suggests the need for better communication regarding bats and their biology, their role within the scientific community, as well as in the general public population. As a consequence, increased knowledge regarding scientists’ perceptions of bats should improve the role scientists play in influencing the perception of bats by the general public.",10.1371/journal.pone.0165969,Medline; PMC,PMC5104368,27832185.0,cc-by,2016-11-10,PLoS One,,,,18898039.0,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165969; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27832185/,2016.0,paper

However, there may be some infected persons whose infection is so mild 44 that the person would recover due to innate immunity even before the hos-45 pitalization. Thus in this article, by the term 'infected' person, we will mean 46 those persons who are hospitalized. Further, we assume that the medical 47 personals assisting COVID-19 positive hospitalized individuals have taken 48 necessary protective items. Thus to keep simplicity, we believe that only 49 exposed persons and asymptomatic infected persons can spread the disease. Since here, we have assumed that the virus of COVID-19 is spreading when 122 a vulnerable person comes into contact with an exposed person; therefore 123 we think that \u03c1 1 (0 < \u03c1 1 < 1) portion of susceptible human would maintain 124 proper precaution measure and \u03c1 2 (0 < \u03c1 2 < 1) portion of the exposed class 125 would take proper precaution measure for disease transmission (i.e., use of 126 face mask, social distancing and implementing hygiene). Therefore the dis-127 ease can only be transmitted to the (1\u2212\u03c1 1 )S portion of susceptible individuals 128 due to the contact of (1\u2212\u03c1 2 )E portion of exposed individuals with a bi-linear 129 disease transmission rate \u03b2. We know that a person is whether infected by 130 the SARS-CoV-2 virus or not can be clinically detected using RT-PCR ex-131 amination and a person with negative results in the RT-PCR test may still 132 be COVID-19 positive as it may take some days (from 7 to 21 days) to ex-133 press infection. Therefore, the portion with positive COVID-19 of the class 134 of population E is considered as infected, and they are hospitalized. Let \u03b1 135 and b 2 be the portions of the exposed class goes to the infected class and 136 quarantine class, respectively. It should be noted that 0 < \u03b1 + b 2 < 1 since 137 it would take quite a long time to get the output of the RT-PCR test, and 138 sometimes it requires more than one RT-PCR analysis for a single person for confirmation of COVID-19. Let among the quarantine classes of populations, 140 cQ portion of communities move to infected level, and the b 1 Q part would 141 become susceptible to the disease after the quarantine period.

SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped virus with non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome [3] , is a member of the Coronaviridae (CoV) family which causes a predominantly respiratory illness with a wide range of clinical severity, ranging from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgias, fatigue, and diarrhea) in a large proportion of patients to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and fatal multi-organ failure [1, 4-6, 7\u2022\u2022] . The disease has a case-fatality rate that ranges from less than 0.5% to more than 7% (average,~3.8%) [8] , with an infectivity greater than that of influenza [9] . Its high transmissibility and relatively high rate of causing serious complications has led COVID-19 to become a serious public health threat worldwide.Among various physiological consequences of severe COVID-19, cardiovascular complications have emerged as some of the most significant and life threatening. COVID-19 may present with respiratory failure from pneumonia and ARDS, with or without distributive \u00b1 cardiogenic shock [10, 11, 12\u2022] , and severe cardiac injury manifesting as markedly elevated troponin and heart failure [12\u2022, 13-14] . Cardiac injury has also been associated with increased mortality [15\u2022\u2022] . In a cohort study of 416 patients with confirmed COVID-19, elevated troponin was present in 19.7% of patients during hospitalization and was found to be an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality [15\u2022\u2022] . The increased incidence of cardiac injury among those with severe systemic inflammatory response syndromes (SIRS) and shock in the setting of COVID-19 also highlights an important relationship between the immune response to the virus and the cardiovascular system. In addition, a high prevalence of pre-existing cardio-metabolic disease has been noted among those with severe COVID-19 [16, 17] , and those with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions suffer increased mortality during COVID-19 infection [18] . In particular, the reported case fatality rates for COVID-19 are 10.5% in patients with cardiovascular disease, 7.3% in patients with diabetes, and 6.0% in those with hypertension, higher than the case-fatality rate of 3-4% observed world-wide for patients without these co-morbidities [7\u2022\u2022] . Last but not least, the increased frequency of adverse cardiovascular events following the resolution of COVID-19, similar to other viral infections such as influenza [19] , may also play a role in worsening the mortality of patients with COVID-19. Thus, understanding the relationship between the viral-host immune response and the cardiovascular system will be critically important in our care and management of patients with COVID-19 going forward."", ""Biology of SARS-CoV-2"": ""In order to better understand the biology of viral immune response and how it impacts the heart, we explore here the basic biological mechanisms underlying viral entry into the host cells and the subsequent immune response. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a single-strand, positive-sense RNA genome approximately 26-32 kilobases in size, which is the largest known genome for an RNA virus. Six coronaviruses (CoVs) are known to infect humans: 229E, OC43, SARS-CoV, NL63, HKU1, and MERS-CoV [3] . In humans, CoV infections primarily involve the upper respiratory tract and GI tract [3] . Studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2, as well as other corona viruses, requires the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cellular entry [20] . ACE2 is a type I integral membrane protein that serves an important role in cardiorenal homeostasis. It is also highly expressed in lung alveolar cells, providing the main entry site for virus into human hosts [21] . It is plausible that the high expression of ACE2 in the lung, gut, heart, and kidneys may facilitate direct damage by the virus throughout the course of infection. One key protein on the virus-the Spike protein (S)-facilitates viral entry into the target cells by the binding of its surface unit, S1, to the ACE2 receptor on the host cell [21] [22] [23] , followed by cleavage by hostcell protease TMPRSS2 [24] . Other important SARS-CoV-2 components include the hemagglutinin-esterase protein, the membrane (M) protein, the nucleocapsid protein, the small envelope protein, the internal protein, and group-specific proteins, which could become targets for vaccines in the future [25] . Of note, SARS-CoV-2 also contains an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which is the target of the anti-viral agent remdesivir, currently being studied randomized clinical trials for use against COVID-19 disease [26] ."", ""The Role of Host Immune Response"": ""The host immune response to viral entry is also important to discuss, as pathogenesis in the later stages of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection results not only from direct viral toxicity but also from immune dysregulation and hyperactivity [27, 28] . Progress in this field, however, has been hindered by the failure to replicate in mice, ferrats, or non-human primates the lethal human immune response in ARDS with the original SARS-CoV strain [29, 30] . This has led to the development of mouse-or rat-adapted strains of SARS-CoV that have been able to replicate the extensive and often lethal pulmonary disease [31] . The majority of studies addressing the immune response to respiratory viral infections involve mice infected with a variety of natural and mouse-adapted pathogens.The process of respiratory viral invasion into the body begins with infection of the airway epithelial cells and the activation of lung-resident dentritic cells (rDCs) via acquisition of the invading pathogen or antigens from infected epithelial cells. These rDCs then become activated, process antigen and migrate to the draining (mediastinal and cervical) lymph nodes (DLN). Na\u00efve circulating T cells in the DLNs then recognize antigens presented on the DCs in the form of MHC/peptide complexes. In combination with additional costimatory signals, T cells then become activated, proliferate, and migrate to the infected site [32, 33] . Upon arrival to the site of infection, T cells produce and release antiviral cytokines including interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and interleukin (IL)-2; chemokines including CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL)-9, 10, and, 11, and cytotoxic molecules such as perforin and granzyme B [34] . IFN-\u03b3 and other effector cytokines directly inhibit viral replication and enhance antigen presentation, while the chemokines released by activated T cells recruit more innate and adaptive cells to combat the pathogen. Granzyme B and other cytotoxic molecules also directly kill infected cells to eliminate the pathogen [35] [36] [37] [38] .Recent data from China on SARS-CoV-2 [28, 39] as well as prior data from SARS-CoV [40] demonstrate a rapid reduction of T lymphocytes (both CD4+ and CD8+) in the peripheral blood of infected patients [27, 41, 42] . This is in direct contrast to the proliferative lymphocyte responses seen with other viral infections such as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, or cytomegalovirus (CMV), but similar to what happens during other acute viral infections, such as influenza. The loss of lymphocytes precedes even the abnormal radiographic changes on chest Xray [43\u2022] . Despite reduction in T lymphocyte counts, peripheral blood analysis on a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated increased markers of T lymphocyte activation [44] , as evidenced by high proportions of HLA-DR and CD38 double-positive fractions [28] . Additionally, there was an increased percentage of highly proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 among CD4+ T cells, and an increased concentration of cytotoxic granules in CD8+ T cells (31.6% perforin positive, 64.2% granulysin positive, and 30.5% granulysin/perforin double-positive) [28] . Interestingly, one group found that production of IFN-\u03b3 by CD4+, T cells but not CD8+ T cells or NK cells tended to be lower in severe cases compared with moderate cases [41] . CD4+ T cells, in particular, are felt to be especially important in the host-immune defense against SARS-CoV infections [45] . In addition, disturbances in T regulatory cells (Tregs) were noted in severe cases-with a significantly lower proportion of C45RA+ na\u00efve Tregs (nTregs) and a slightly higher proportion of their memory counterparts CD45RO+ memory Tregs (mTregs) [41] . On recovery, there is a rapid and significant restoration of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells along with B cell and NK cell counts 2-3 months after onset of disease [40] . Memory CD4+ T cells returned to normal 1 year after onset, whereas other cell counts including total T lymphocytes, CD3+, CD4+ and na\u00efve CD4+ T cells were still lower than healthy controls [43\u2022] . The mechanism of lymphocytopenia in peripheral blood is unclear but thought to be due to sequestration, with release of sequestered cells upon recovery [21] . Taken together, these changes in lymphocyte populations suggest dramatic dysregulation, evidence of T cell \""exhaustion\"" and shifts in the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections [42] .In addition to changes in lymphocyte populations, changes in innate immunity likely also contribute to viral pathogenesis, particularly as seen in severe lung and systemic inflammation secondary to cytokine storm. In ARDS, increased levels of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IFN inducible protein 10 (IP10), IL-6, and IL-8 are thought to contribute to tissue destruction and poor outcomes [46] , attributed to hyperactivation of macrophage/monocyte lineage cells. SARS-CoV-2-infected patients have high levels of IL-1 beta, IFN-\u03b3, IP-10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which probably leads to activated T-helper-1 cell response [1] . Compared with patients who did not require ICU admission, those requiring ICU admission had higher conentrations of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (GCSF), IP-10, MCP-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 \u03b1 (MIP-1-\u03b1), and TNF-\u03b1, suggesting that cytokine storm might affect disease severity [47] . Additionally, increased levels of type I IFN and a dysregulated IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) response have been seen in patients with severe SARS [48, 49] .Last but not least, SARS-specific IgG antibodies are produced in the late acute stage (about 2 weeks from symptom onset), gradually increase throughout the course of the disease and are felt to be associated with disease outcome [50] . The development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is highly relevant for both protecting against viral replication/expansion in the infected host as well as providing a source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma to treat patients with severe disease, although supporting data for efficacy is currently lacking. This is being tested in COVID-19 positive patients under an expanded access program by the FDA [51] ."", ""Viral Toxicity and Myocardial Injury in COVID-2"": ""Myocardial injury, manifesting as elevated serum troponin levels, has been described in many patients infected with COVID-19, and mortality has been associated with increase in troponin levels > 99th percentile of the upper limit of normal and with electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities [12\u2022, 18, 52] . In addition, reports of the rarer manifestation of fulminant myocarditis with markedly elevated troponin levels have been reported [12\u2022, 13, 14] .There are several thoughts on the mechanism of injury, including direct myocardial injury by the virus through ACE2 entry, hypoxia-induced myocardial injury, microvascular damage and endothelial shedding, and cytokine/ inflammation-mediated damage [15\u2022\u2022] . Direct viral toxicity on cardiomyocytes has occurred in the setting of other viral infections such as coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis. In this case, the entry of the coxsackievirus is through the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) and through release of protease 2A coded by coxsackievirus particles, disrupting the dystrophin cytoskeleton complex [53] [54] [55] . In the case of coronavirus, as mentioned above, the spike (S) protein of coronaviruses facilitates viral entry into target cells. Entry depends on binding of the surface unit, S1, of the S protein to ACE2, allowing the virus to attach to the surface of the target cell. In addition, entry requires S protein priming by cellular proteases, which entails S protein cleavage at the S1/S2 and S2' site and allows fusion of viral and cellular membranes, a process driven by the S2 subunit [23] . It was found that SARS-2-S shares 76% amino acid identity with SARS-S, and both engage ACE2 and employ the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming for host cell entry [22] . Interestingly, injection of SARS-CoV Spike protein into mice worsened acute lung failure in vivo, and was attenuated by blockade of the renin-angiotensin pathway [21] . Also of note, TMPRSS2 is highly expressed in the lung and kidneys, but is present in only low to moderate levels in the heart and blood vessels, suggesting other mechanisms of injury for the latter organ systems [56] . Lastly, the amount of viral load in SARS-CoV-2 infection correlates with disease severity, with higher viral loads on presentation correlating with worse disease outcomes [57] . This study highlights the potential importance of direct viral toxicity in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infections.In addition to direct damage caused by the virus, there has also been speculation of an ischemic effect, either in the form of demand ischemia from lung pathology or direct toxicity by the virus on the macro-or microvascular level. It has been suggested that, because ACE2 is expressed on the endothelium, it may induce endothelial shedding and dysfunction contributing to vascular damage, local inflammation, and production of procoagulant factors predisposing to thrombosis, similar to the increase in myocardial infarctions observed after influenza infections [19, 58] . In addition to endothelial inflammation and dysfunction, an increased incidence of abnormal coagulation parameters and of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has been noted in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection [59, 60] , contributing to risk of thrombosis and ischemic events that could damage the myocardium."", ""Immune Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Infection and the Heart"": ""Early reports of fulminant myocarditis have alerted the medical and scientific communities that myocardial inflammation may play a role in cardiac injury during viral infection [12\u2022, 13, 14] . However, the exact mechanism of this is currently unclear [12\u2022, 13] , as acute lymphocyte infiltrates were not noted in the myocardium of a SARS-CoV-2-infected ARDS patient autopsy [39] , where only a few mononuclear inflammatory cells were seen. Currently, there is great interest in obtaining the pathological specimens from patients presenting with markedly elevated troponin and fulminant myocarditis in order to evaluate for lymphocyte-induced myocardial injury in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Consistent with this, no myocardialspecific epitopes have thus far been identified in the setting of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several HLA-A*02:01-specific T cells recognizing SARS-CoV epitopes have been identified in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of SARS-recovered individuals, including immunogenic epitopes localized to spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV [61, 62] . Of note, MRI-verified acute myocarditis has been reported in association with MERS-CoV [63] , although the exact mechanism by which it occurs is unknown.Although no evidence of direct lymphocytic infiltration of the myocardium exists, the dysregulation of T cells can likely contribute to the cytokine storm and multi-organ damage in the setting of coronavirus infection. A recent retrospective, multi-center study of 150 patients confirmed that inflammatory markers, including elevated ferritin (mean 1297.6 ng/ml in non-survivors vs 614.0 ng/ml in survivors, p < 0.001) and IL-6 (p < 0.0001) were associated with more severe COVID-19 infection, suggesting that systemic inflammation may be a significant driver of multi-organ damage [18, 64] . A separate group has also reported that the serum cytokines IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 are increased in patients with severe disease [41] . This systemic release of cytokines, characterized by increased IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, GCSF, IFN-\u03b3, MCP-1, MIP-1-\u03b1, and TNF-\u03b1, likely contributes to cardiac injury in a situation analogous to cardiotoxicity in the setting of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy. A prior study demonstrated that cardiac injury and cardiovascular events in the form of elevated troponin and left ventricular systolic dysfunction are common post-CAR-T; in a cohort of 137 patients with post-CAR-T cytokine release syndrome (CRS), 21% had elevated troponin and 12% developed cardiovascular events including cardiac arrest, decompensated heart failure, and arrhythmias [65] . Notably in this study, a shorter time from CRS onset to the administration of the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab was associated with a lower rate of cardiovascular events [65] . Of note, tociluzumab may have some benefit in COVID-19 infection, suggesting a common mechanism of injury in the two settings [66] . The exact mechanism by which cytokines/chemokines damage the myocardium is unknown, but cardiomyocyte and endothelial cell death in the presence of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 has been well documented in the literature [67, 68] ."", ""Host-Specific Variations in COVID-19 Immune Response"": ""Age and gender differences in COVID-19 infection rates have raised interest in possible differences in age-and genderdependent immune responses to viral exposure. Children account for the minority of laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China and appear less susceptible to severe disease [69] . Although the functions of both innate and adaptive immune immunity declines with aging, this does not typically start until late adulthood, and thus would not fully explain the decreased severity of disease in children compared with even young adults. [70] [71] [72] . The effect of age on the immune system can be demonstrated by the low protective titers among 50% of adults older than 65 who receive the influenza vaccine [73] . Additional information about the differential response of SARS-CoVand SARS-CoV-2 with aging comes from animal models; in comparison with SARS-CoV-MA15-infected young C57BL/6 mice, infection of aged mice (12 months) is associated with severe reduction in the number of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in the lungs [66] .In addition to the effect of aging, gender is also thought to play a role in outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection. One study demonstrated a higher incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in older adult males compared with females [74] . Sex differences in immune response have been noted in literature, although the reasons are not clear. Males experience greater severity and prevalence of bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic infections than females, who also mount a more robust response to antigenic challenges including infection and vaccination [75] [76] [77] [78] . We (Davis et al) have used machine learning approaches to identify a cluster of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, previously shown to be upregulated by testosterone, which correlates with poor virus-neutralizing activity in men [79] . Interestingly, the stronger immune response in females is thought to explain why females are more prone to immunemediated pathologies including autoimmune disease and cytokine storm [78] . However, in the case of COVID-19, there is no data to currently support a female-predominance toward cytokine storm; if anything, males are prone to more severe disease and mortality [74] . Thus, it would be important to gather more data and larger number cohort studies on the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to study further delineate whether there is a gender-dependent risk for cytokine storm and subsequent cardiac injury in COVID-19 infection."", ""Treatments for SARS-CoV-2 Infection"": ""Various therapies have emerged to treat the various aspects of viral pathogenesis and subsequent immune response, and an understanding of which aspect of disease pathogenesis they target may aide the clinician in knowing when to use them. Treatments which target steps early in the infection process (\""respiratory phase\"" in Fig. 1 ) are meant to suppress viral replication and aid the host immune response to fight the virus. When the immune response becomes hyperactive (\""sepsis/shock\"" phase in Fig. 1 ) with cytokine storm, immunomodulators that target various harmful inflammatory cytokines may help mitigate end-organ toxicity. Unfortunately, there are currently no FDA-approved therapies for SARS-CoV-2, and no substantial randomized trial data to support any therapy thus far. However, several promising therapies are actively being test in patients including the recently announced multicenter, randomized SOLIDARITY trial (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine) sponsored by the World Health Organization [51] .Anti-microbial agents which target the early (pre-systemic) phase of infection include remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin. Remdesivir is a drug which targets the RNA polymerase, suppresses viral replication, and has strong in vitro evidence of efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 [26] . Although randomized trial data are still pending [51] , there have been anecdotal reports of improvement after compassionate use of remdesivir [80] . Lopinavir-ritonavir is another RNA polymerase inhibitor which showed initial promise, but a recently published study from Beijing showed no significant difference in the treatment versus control group, suggesting that the effect, if present, was insufficient to cause a significant clinical response [81] . Chloroquine has traditionally been used as an anti-malaria drug, but has shown reasonable efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [26] . A single arm study of 20 COVID-19-positive patients treated in France demonstrated some efficacy for the combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, a safer variation of chloroquine, in SARS-CoV-2 [80] . Another small non-randomized study showed similar results [82] However, these were small, non-randomized studies in whose definition of efficacy was based on viral clearance rather than mortality benefit. A subsequent pilot randomized trial in Shanghai comparing hydroxychloroquine and placebo has shown no difference in virologic clearance [83] . Azithromycin is an antimicrobial agent generally used for antibacterial purposes; however, it also has been shown to inhibit zika virus tropism in the human brain and has been suggested as an adjunct for treatment of intracellular microbes in the past [80, 81] . Since both chloroquine/ hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin lead to corrected QT (QTC) prolongation, their use either alone or in combination should be monitored for this potential cardiotoxic side effect [84] .The second group of therapies is immunomodulators, used to target immune hyperactivity and the cytokine storm that occurs in the later stages of COVID-19 infection [64] . Monoclonal antibodies have shown some promise in early studies. The IL-6 inhibitors tocilizumab and sarilumab have shown early benefit and are being studied in ongoing randomized trials [51] . Other therapies including meplazumab (anti-CD147), eculizumab (targets complement), adalimumab (TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor), and IVIG (saturation of Fc receptors on macrophages, suppression of chemokines/cytokines) are also intended toward reduction of deleterious immune effects [51] . Interestingly, immune stimulatory agents aimed at enhancing beneficial aspects of the immune response are also being tested-including IFN-\u03b21a, PD-1 inhibitors, and donor convalescent plasma [51] . There are conflicting data to support the use of glucocorticoids in COVID-19 related ARDS [85] , and even potential evidence of harm in the form of decreased viral clearance in SARS and MERS [86] and increased mortality in SARS-CoV2 [87] . Without evidence of acute lymphocytic myocarditis in cardiovascular injury, we do not currently advocate for the routine administration of glucocorticoids for elevated troponin in COVID-19 patients. Randomized trials on both glucocorticoids and IVIG in severe cases of COVID-19 are ongoing [51] ."", ""Conclusion"": ""SARS-CoV-2 has become a worldwide health threat, with the numbers of infected patients growing rapidly. An increased incidence of cardiac injury has been observed among those with severe infection. The mechanism of cardiac injury is unclear but likely involves a combination of direct viral damage and immune-mediated damage by inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and cytotoxic immune cell response in the later stages of infection. The host immune response and contributors to cytokine storm in SARS-CoV-2 infection are complex. Significant depletion and dysregulation of T lymphocytes may contribute to immune dysregulation and hyperactivity. Cardiac damage in the setting of cytokine storm may be analogous to that seen in cardiotoxicity from CAR-T. Treatments for COVID-19 are bimodal, with one group of treatments targeted toward early infection and viral replication, and another group targeted toward immune modulation in the later, systemic inflammatory phase of infection. With the advent of single cell immune phenotyping technologies, it will be important to perform comprehensive immune surveys of infected patients to better understand systemic perturbations with the infection and downstream cardiovascular effects. More data are needed to help guide us toward definitive treatment and protection of the cardiovascular system in COVID-19 infection. 1 Hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and immune response in cardiovascular injury. Spike protein (SARS-2-S) on the virus is activated by cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 highly expressed in lung, renal, and gastrointestinal cells and engages with angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that is highly expressed on respiratory epithelial cells for entry into the host cell. Early infection is characterized by viral replication and direct damage by the virus to host cells, via ACE2/TMPRSS2-mediated cell entry. As infection progresses, pro-inflammatory signals upregulate inflammatory cytokine production by cells in the adaptive and innate immune system, leading to cytokine storm and multi-organ damage""}",Cardiovascular Complications in Patients with COVID-19: Consequences of Viral Toxicities and Host Immune Response,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. While cardiac injury has been demonstrated in critically ill COVID-19 patients, the mechanism of injury remains unclear. Here, we review our current knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential mechanisms of myocardial injury due to viral toxicities and host immune responses. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of studies have reported an epidemiological association between history of cardiac disease and worsened outcome during COVID infection. Development of new onset myocardial injury during COVID-19 also increases mortality. While limited data exist, potential mechanisms of cardiac injury include direct viral entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and toxicity in host cells, hypoxia-related myocyte injury, and immune-mediated cytokine release syndrome. Potential treatments for reducing viral infection and excessive immune responses are also discussed. SUMMARY: COVID patients with cardiac disease history or acquire new cardiac injury are at an increased risk for in-hospital morbidity and mortality. More studies are needed to address the mechanism of cardiotoxicity and the treatments that can minimize permanent damage to the cardiovascular system.",10.1007/s11886-020-01292-3,Medline; PMC,PMC7171437,32318865.0,no-cc,2020-04-21,Curr Cardiol Rep,,,,216033214.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11886-020-01292-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32318865/,2020.0,paper

Methods 125 COVID-19 patients enrolled in this study were classified into mild (93 cases) and severe (32 cases) groups, basing on their 3 to 7-days clinical outcomes. Patients' gender, age, comorbid with underlying diseases, epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory tests on admission were collected and subsequently analyzed with single-factor and multivariate logistic regression methods. Finally, we evaluate their prognostic values with the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Results Seventeen factors on admission differed significantly between mild and severe groups. Next, only four factors, including the comorbid with underlying diseases, increased respiratory rate (>24/min), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP >10mg/liter), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH >250U/liter), were found to be independently associated with the later disease development. Prognostic value analysis by ROC indicated that individual factors could not confidently predict the occurrence of severe pneumonia, but that the combination of fast respiratory rate and elevated LDH significantly increase the predictive confidence (AUC= 0.944, sensitivity= 0.941, and specificity= 0.902). Three- or four-factors combinations, including elevated LDH and fast respiratory rate, further increased the prognostic value. Additionally, measurable serum viral RNA post-admission could independently predict the severe illness occurrence.

These policies all require important testing capabilities, as was exemplified in Wuhan where all 11 Million citizens were recently tested in 10 days during May 2020. In some Southern countries, the amount of new cases is still increasing and wide population testing cannot be achieve everywhere. Thus, scaling up and maintaining large testing capacities worldwide remains a challenge, with limited reagent production and scarcity of testing equipment likely to remain limitations.Group testing or pooling, first suggested by Dorfman in 1943, is a protocol through which individual samples are combined together before running the test (1) . The advantage of the method is an overall saving in the number of tests required to screen a given population (2) , and thereby an increase in testing capabilities for fixed reagent and instrumentation availability. Savings depend on key parameters such as the disease prevalence and the group size. Group testing protocols using real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) have been evaluated and implemented for Covid-19 screening around the world in several experiments using RT-PCR detection techniques, notably in Israel, Germany, California, Nebraska, NY State, and Italy (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) .Although these studies show that positive individuals can be detected in pooled samples, the number of amplification cycles needed to detect (Ct value) those is often increased by dilution and perhaps by inhibition effects (3, 5, 7, 9) . This can prevent weakly positive specimen from being detected in group samples (3, 8) . Concerns about the sensitivity of group testing have been raised by French medical authorities, leading to a negative recommendation on their use in France (10) .Digital PCR (or RT-dPCR) is a PCR technique known for its higher sensitivity and precision over classical RT-PCR (11, 12) . Digital PCR has also been shown to be more resistant to PCR inhibitors (13) . Recent studies have confirmed high sensitivity of RT-dPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 (14) (15) (16) .In this study we propose a novel group testing protocol using a commercially available RT-dPCR assay and compare empirically the sensitivity of individual identification through RT-PCR with group testing by RT-dPCR for three groups sizes of 8, 16 and 32 samples. We find that, in our condition of evaluation, group testing by RT-dPCR has a better or similar sensitivity than the reference individual RT-PCR testing for groups of 8 and 16."", ""Material and Methods"": ""Summary of the method of the comparative study Overall, 448 patient samples are tested for SARS-CoV-2 by i) individual RT-PCR (local gold standard method), ii) RT-dPCR in 56 groups of 8 samples, iii) RT-dPCR in 28 groups of 16 samples and iv) RT-dPCR in 14 groups of 32 samples and results are compared between all four test protocols. In case of discordance between the results of individual RT-PCR testing and group testing in RT-dPCR, samples were re-analyzed individually by RT-dPCR, by the gold-standard RT-PCR and a confirmatory RT-PCR assay.

"", ""Specimens collection, storage and pooling"": ""Nasopharyngeal swabs of 448 patients screened for Covid-19 at the Bichat university hospital (Paris, France), one of the two Paris reference centers for emerging diseases, between May 6 th and May 26 th , 2020 were included. All samples were collected in universal transport medium (UTM) (Virocult\u00ae or eSwab TM ) and tested, within 15 hours maximum upon collection, for SARS-CoV-2 detection according to the local standards. Briefly, 400 \u00b5L of transport medium were tested by RT-PCR (Cobas SARS-CoV-2 test, Roche). All the remaining volume of transport medium of all specimens were kept at +5\u00b0C.No later than 24 hours after routine screening, all samples with a leftover UTM volume above 600 \u00b5L were systematically included in the group testing analysis. Thus, 125 \u00b5L of each included specimen were sampled and randomly mixed with seven others to generate a total of 56 groups of 8 specimens with a final volume of 1 mL per group. Nucleic acids were extracted from each group prior to viral titration by RT-dPCR. The remaining volume of transport medium was stored at +5\u00b0C for further investigations if required.According to the current French ethical laws, samples used in the current study were only included after the completion of all analysis required for the patient's care."", ""Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by routine individual RT-PCR testing"": ""All 448 specimens were analyzed individually on a Cobas\u00ae 6800 system (Roche, Switzerland) for Covid-19 screening using the Cobas\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 Test kit targeting conserved regions for ORF-1a/b and Egene. For each specimen, 400 \u00b5L of transport medium were mixed with 400 \u00b5L of Cobas\u00ae lysis buffer and loaded on the robot. During the run, extracts were eluted in 50 \u00b5L of which 27 \u00b5L were used in the RT-PCR amplification of E and ORF-1a/b.

Nucleic acids were eluted from 1mL to 50 \u00b5L of the elution buffer provided with the kit and stored at +5\u00b0C for a maximum of 12 hours before analysis."", ""Preparation of groups of 16 and 32 individuals"": ""After extraction of the 56 groups of 8 specimen (P8 extracts) and prior to viral titration by RT-dPCR, 28 groups of 16 individual samples (P16 groups) were obtained by mixing 15 \u00b5L of 2 P8 extracts and 14 groups of 32 (P32 groups) were obtained by mixing 10 \u00b5L of 2 P16 groups.Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by grouped RT-dPCR testing SARS-CoV-2 titration of the grouped samples by RT-dPCR was performed on the Naica system (Stilla Technologies, France) within the next three hours after extraction, using the COVID-19 Multiplex Digital PCR Detection Kit (Stilla Technologies, France/Apexbio, China). This one-step reversetranscription PCR kit is a triplex PCR allowing amplification, detection and quantification of one sequence in the N gene, one sequence in the ORF1ab region of SARS-CoV2 and an endogenous internal control (IC) to assess the quality of the sample and extraction. These sequences are targeted by three TaqMan probes respectively labelled with a FAM, HEX and Cy\u00ae5 fluorophore.As recommended by the kit manufacturer, the PCR mix for a single reaction contained 12.5 \u00b5L of dPCR MasterMix 1, 1 \u00b5L of dPCR Mix 2, 1 \u00b5L of COVID-19 Assay and 10.5 \u00b5L of either, P8, P16, P32, positive control, negative control or individual extract. The 25 \u00b5L of this PCR mix were loaded in the inlet ports of the Sapphire chips (Stilla Technologies, France). The chips were placed in the Naica Geode (Stilla Technologies, France) for droplets generation, reverse transcription and PCR amplification following the kit manufacturer's instructions.After amplification, the chips were transferred to the Naica Prism3 (Stilla technologies, France) for fluorescence reading in the three detection channels and data were analyzed with Crystal Miner Software (Stilla Technologies, France) following the kit manufacturer's instructions.An illustration of the resulting fluorescence dot-plots used to quantify the SARS-CoV-2 virus by RT-dPCR is shown in Supplementary Materials."", ""Individual confirmatory testing for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and RT-dPCR"": ""In case of discrepancies between individual RT-qPCR and grouped RT-dPCR, RT-dPCR results were confirmed by extracting individually each sample of the group and retesting them individually according to the previously described RT-dPCR protocol. Confirmatory RT-qPCR test were also performed on individual samples as previously described with the Cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay and a third method, RealStar\u00ae SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit (Altona Diagnostics, Germany), was also performed on an ABI 7500 thermocycler (ThermoFisher Scientific, United-States) from the same individual extraction as for the confirmatory RT-dPCR assay. Briefly, this latter assay targets all lineage B-betacoronaviruses by amplifying a sequence of the E gene and a sequence of the S gene specific to SARS-CoV-2 as well as a heterologous internal control.

The results for all 32 groups are given in Supplementary Materials. The LoB at 95% confidence level for the N target and the ORF1ab target is determined to be of 2 and 0 positive droplets respectively. The LoD at 95% confidence level for each target is of 0.49 copies / \u00b5L (7 copies/PCR) and 0.24 copies/\u00b5L (3 copies/PCR), respectively.Consequently, a threshold of a least 3 positive droplets in aggregate between both the N target and ORF1ab target is used to classify a sample as positive to SARS-CoV-2 by RT-dPCR in this study."", ""Cohort description from routine RT-PCR testing"": ""Using routine RT-PCR testing, 25 samples were identified as positive out of the 448 samples tested, corresponding to an average test positivity rate of 5.5%.

The Ct values for the sample associated with the RT-PCR+/dPCR-discordance was of 34 and 32.3 for the E gene and ORF1ab with the Cobas\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 assay, respectively. This sample is referred to as Sample 25659 for later discussion.Complementary analysis of the discordances are depicted below. Detailed results for RT-dPCR in groups of 16The results for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-dPCR in groups of 16 samples, detailed in Tables 1 and 3 , are in concordance with individual RT-PCR testing for 25 groups (corresponding for 400 samples), out of which 11 are RT-PCR-groups and 14 are RT-PCR+ groups. Among the three groups with discording results, one presented a RT-PCR-/dPCR+ discordance (Group ID: P16_14) and two RT-PCR+/dPCRdiscordances (Group IDs: P16_13 and P16_28). Investigation of RT-PCR-/dPCR+ discordances To further investigate these RT-PCR-/dPCR+ discordances, confirmatory testing RT-dPCR was performed on all individual samples from corresponding groups. For each group, one sample tested positive by individual RT-dPCR, with measured concentrations of viral RNA ranging from 128 copies per reaction to 2 copies per reaction for the N gene, and from 106 to 1 copies for the ORF1ab gene.The three corresponding dPCR+ samples (sample IDs: 52042, 56075 and 60401) were retested on the Investigation of the sample RT-PCR+/dPCR-One group of 8 (P8_02) was tested negative by RT-dPCR and contained one RT-PCR+ sample (Sample 25659) with Ct values of 34 and 32.3 for the E gene and ORF1ab respectively. Sample 25659 was subsequently retested by RT-PCR on the Cobas protocol and was also re-extracted individually and retested by individual RT-dPCR.Sample_25659 was found to be borderline negative by RT-dPCR (N=2; ORF1ab=0) but Ct values of 37.3 and 34.9 were found for E and ORF respectively in the second Cobas\u00ae assessment.Based on these results and for further sensitivity discussions, sample 25659 is considered as a true positive samples. "", ""Discussion"": ""In this work, we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of group testing combined with digital PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Three different group sizes were investigated using a commercially available digital PCR assay, the COVID-19 Multiplex Digital PCR Detection Kit (Stilla Technologies, France/Apexbio, China). This assay demonstrated a low LoB (at 2 and 0 positive droplets per PCR for N and ORF1ab genes, respectively) and low LoD (at 5 and 3 copies/PCR for N and ORF1ab genes, respectively). This LoD is lower than most estimation for WHO and other reference RT-PCR assays typically ranging between 5 to 500 copies/PCR (17, 18) .For our analysis, we proposed a protocol of group screening performed by RT-dPCR with secondary individual re-testing of positive groups as illustrated in Figure 3 . We assessed this protocol by assessing in real-life condition 448 consecutive samples grouped by 8, 16 and 32 samples.We observed a better sensitivity than individual RT-PCR testing for groups of 8 samples. Indeed, a total of 23 groups of 8 samples tested positive and included 26 true positive samples. Only 25 samples were identified as positive using reference individual RT-PCR testing, corresponding to an +4% improvement in sensitivity. Two among the three samples associated with RT-PCR-/dPCR+ discordances were confirmed as true positive by RT-PCR using a SARS-CoV-2 specific assay from Altona. The last one was not confirmed as positive by RT-PCR and is undergoing further investigations. One sample was associated to a RT-PCR+/dPCR-discrepant results and is also considered a true positive sample as confirmed by RT-PCR retesting. Further investigation by sequencing is underway on these 4 samples in an effort to rigorously assess the existence and nature of nucleic acids variations responsible for the discording results. Testing in the 14 groups of 32 samples by RT-dPCR has 100% concordance with the reference RT-PCR testing. Re-testing positive groups by RT-dPCR would have likely led to better sensitivity than RT-PCR. However, we are careful in drawing conclusions for groups of 32 given the limited data points in this case as only 14 groups, including only 2 RT-PCR negative groups.An alternative and even more cost-effective group testing protocol could be to perform the re-testing steps using RT-PCR with Cobas or Altona assays. In these protocols, the sensitivity becomes dependent on the RT-PCR kit used, leading to potential discrepancies with RT-dPCR as observed in our results for groups of 8 samples. However, our data suggest that performing the individual tests for groups of 8 and 16 with a RT-PCR assay would still have a similar sensitivity.Overall, our data indicates that COVID-19 group testing combined with digital PCR for large group sizes of 8 and 16 samples, followed by individual re-testing of positive groups, has better or similar sensitivity than individual RT-PCR testing. Groups of 32 samples could also be considered, but our analysis needs to be confirmed in the future as, due to the epidemiological situation at the time, a low number of negative groups and groups containing a single positive sample were assessed.The gain in sensitivity of the proposed method is likely due to a combination of i) a concentration effect due to performing the pooling prior extraction and performing the extraction step from a large volume of 1 mL of pooled transport medium and ii) the intrinsic superior sensitivity of digital PCR compared to RT-PCR, as demonstrated previously for SARS-CoV-2 (14-16) and other viruses (12, 19) detection.Below standard sensitivity is one of the main reasons why group testing has not been widely adopted for COVID-19 testing, whilst research groups have advocated for its implementation as a solution to the world-wide un-met demand for tests and reagent shortage(2-9).The current study suggests that the high sensitivity of group testing could be achieved using by digital PCR instead of RT-PCR in the first group screening step. It makes the approach viable for large-scale, low cost patient screening with minimum reagent consumption. For a test positivity rate of 1%, our group testing protocol would save 79%, 80% and 69% of reagents compared to individual testing, for group sizes of 8, 16 and 32 samples. Group size does not significantly impact cost or reagent consumption for group sizes above 8 samples and test positivity rates below 1%. Consequently, the choice of group size (8, 16 or 32) is mostly a balance of sensitivity and test capacity. Our results indicate that group testing by digital PCR and a group size of 16 would increase testing capabilities by more than 10-fold while having a sensitivity comparable to the current standard of individual testing by RT-PCR.Group testing can be used in various context where testing is not currently put in place due to testing capacity or with strong economics constraints and where SARS-CoV-2 prevalence is low. In countries where the pandemic is not yet under control or could re-emerge, enhancing testing capacity is essential to winning the battle against COVID-19. In countries where the first wave is fading, the fight against COVID-19 goes through a combination between a test / trace / isolate strategy and social distancing. Increasing the range of people tested amongst contacts with positive cases, but also periodic testing of population in frequent contact with others (e.g. nurses, transportation workers, clerks, etc\u2026) as well as in fragile populations such as nursing homes can be part of a strategy against COVID-19 while allowing a relaxation of social distancing measures at the same time. Group testing can help in all of these situations.Supplementary Materials S1 -Data format for RT-dPCR as obtained with the Naica System The pre-epidemic groups were used as negative controls for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Only one out of 32 (group 5) had one positive droplet for the N target out of 19881 droplets analyzed. The LOB at 95% confidence level for this RT-dPCR assay was estimated automatically by the Gene-Pi online statistical tool (https://www.genepi.com/statistical-tools/loblod/), considering a droplet volume of 0.548 nL as specified by the manufacturer. The LOD at 95% confidence level is computed from the experimental LOB. The LOB for the N and ORF1ab targets are found to be of 2 and 0 droplets respectively. The LODs are found to be of 0.46 copies/\u00b5L and 0.22 copies/\u00b5L, or equivalently of 7 and 3 copies per PCR reaction.Using a joint analysis, a LOB analysis can be performed for the combination of the N and ORF1ab targets. In the case, the sum of the positives for the N and OFR1ab target is used as the measure and the LOB for the sum is 2 positive droplets. Consequently, in this study, a RT-dPCR result is considered as positive when the sum of positive droplets in the N and ORF1ab targets is of 3 droplets or more (strictly greater than 2).For details on calculation models, see: ""}",High-sensitivity COVID-19 group testing by digital PCR,"Background: Worldwide demand for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing is increasing as more countries are impacted by COVID-19 and as testing remains central to contain the spread of the disease, both in countries where the disease is emerging and in countries that are past the first wave but exposed to re-emergence. Group testing has been proposed as a solution to expand testing capabilities but sensitivity concerns have limited its impact on the management of the pandemic. Digital PCR (RT-dPCR) has been shown to be more sensitive than RT-PCR and could help in this context. Methods: We implemented RT-dPCR based COVID-19 group testing on commercially available system and assay (Naica System from Stilla Technologies) and investigated the sensitivity of the method in real life conditions of a university hospital in Paris, France, in May 2020. We tested the protocol in a direct comparison with reference RT-PCR testing on 448 samples split into groups of 3 sizes for RT-dPCR analysis: 56 groups of 8 samples, 28 groups of 16 samples and 14 groups of 32 samples. Results: Individual RT-PCR testing identified 25 positive samples. Using groups of 8, testing by RT-dPCR identified 23 groups as positive, corresponding to 26 true positive samples including 2 samples not initially detected by individual RT-PCR but confirmed positive by further RT-PCR and RT-dPCR investigation. For groups of 16, 15 groups tested positive, corresponding to 25 true positive samples identified. 100% concordance is found for groups of 32 but with limited data points.",,ArXiv,,,arxiv,2020-06-03,,,,2006.02908,219305090.0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02908v1.pdf,2020.0,paper

By the 16th of October 2018, 2260 con- "", ""Human coronaviruses"": ""The first two coronaviruses demonstrated to cause respiratory infections in humans, the coronaviruses 229E and OC43, were identified in the 1960s. They were held responsible for respiratory infections of moderate severity in humans. Despite these viruses being identified in several reports as causing lower respiratory tract infections, it was generally accepted that coronaviruses were of low pathogenicity until the emergence of SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) in 2002, a virus with a fatality rate estimated at 10%. The SARS outbreak that resulted in more than 8400 cases was finally contained two years later, in 2004, and the virus has not been detected again since [4] . There was renewed interest in coronavirus research following the SARS epidemic, and two novel endemic human coronaviruses were identified, NL63 and HKU1 respectively in 2004 and 2005, but could not be replicated in cell culture. Both of these new viruses were responsible for respira-tory infections of moderate seriousness like the coronaviruses 229E and OC43. Great effort has been made to identify coronaviruses in animal populations, both before and after the SARS outbreak, in order to better understand and control the risk of animal-to-human transmission. This resulted in the discovery of coronaviruses in numerous animal species, with a few exceptions such as sheep and goats, fish and non-human primates [5] ."", ""Emergence of the MERS epidemic"": ""The first case of MERS-CoV infection was reported in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in June 2012 [1] . The patient, a 60-year-old man, died from lung and kidney failure 11 days after being admitted to hospital. Very shortly afterwards, in September 2012, a second patient was admitted to hospital in the United Kingdom for severe respiratory infection related to a novel coronavirus following travel to the Middle East. The new virus was found to replicate in a tissue culture model and was rapidly isolated and identified for both cases [6, 7] . Retrospectively, other cases of the disease were found to have occurred before the 2 aforementioned cases: in April 2012, an outbreak at Zarqa hospital in Jordan affected the staff of the intensive care unit, with two fatal cases. The respiratory samples collected were later confirmed to be positive for MERS-CoV [8] .These initial cases were rapidly followed by a series of outbreaks in all Saudi Arabian provinces that were characterized by the infection of health professionals in direct contact with the patients. Other similar outbreaks were observed in several neighboring countries: Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan and Tunisia. Health authorities reacted quickly to the reports of these epidemics and the strong resemblance with observed clinical features of SARS-CoV infections. Indeed, although a few patients developed mild infections, the fatality rate for patients infected with MERS-CoV was over 30% [2] ."", ""Natural reservoir of MERS-CoV"": ""Following the identification of MERS-CoV, great effort was put into finding which animal species it originated from in order to stop the further spread of the disease to humans. MERS-CoV was very rapidly determined to be genotypically closely related to the betacoronavirus lineage C viruses identified in bats [9] . Based on these findings, and the major role of bats in the genetic diversity and spread of coronaviruses, much of the initial work aiming at finding the natural reservoir of MERS-CoV focused on bats. However, no conclusive evidence demonstrating that bats were the natural reservoir of MERS-CoV in the Arabian peninsula were found, despite the identification of closely related viruses in bats in Sub-Saharan Africa [10] , far from the existing outbreaks. Very strong epidemiological links were identified between the human cases and camels and resulted in the isolation in camels of viruses that were directly related to MERS-CoV and that could replicate in cultured human cells [11] . The investigation of dromedary camel serum collections, some of which collected as early as 1983, demonstrated that the virus was already widespread (seropositivity rate > 80%) in the East African countries (Somalia, Sudan and Egypt). These countries export dromedary camels to Arabian countries, but also in Kenya, Nigeria, Tunisia, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso and Morocco [12] [13] [14] . Phylogenetic analysis revealed 5 distinct coronavirus lineages in dromedary camels, including one recombinant lineage that led to the MERS-CoV epidemic in humans [15] ."", ""Virus structure and cycle"": ""MERS-CoV is a betacoronavirus belonging to lineage C. It is an enveloped virus with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of about 30 kb. Under electron microscopy, virions are generally spherical with surface projections (spikes) formed by the surface protein S creating an image reminiscent of a crown or solar corona. The positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome acts as messenger RNA (mRNA) with a 5 cap and a 3 polyadenylated tail. It plays three roles during the host cell cycle: (i) it acts as the initial RNA molecule for the infection cycle; (ii) it is the template for replication and transcription; (iii) it is the substrate that is packaged into the newly assembled viral particles [16] .The MERS-CoV genome is organized in the same way as other coronavirus species. The first two thirds of the MERS-CoV genome contain two overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that translate into the replication-transcription complex including 16 non-structural proteins. The remaining third of the genome encodes the four structural proteins, the spike (S), envelop (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, as well as five accessory proteins (ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5 and ORF8b) that are not required for genome replication but are probably involved in virulence. The flanking sequences, on both ends of the genome, contain untranslated 5 and 3 regions (UTR) (Fig. 3 ) [17] .The viral particle can enter the cell in two ways, which probably contribute to the broad tissue tropism of this virus that replicates mainly in respiratory epithelial cells but can also infect many other cell types. Via the endosomal pathway, the S1 domain of the MERS-CoV spike protein (S) binds its receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) [18] , induces endocytosis of the viral particle and a change in the conformation of the S2 subunit of the S protein that then mediates virus-host membrane fusion and uncoating of virus RNA. MERS-CoV can also enter host cells via a non-endosomal mechanism by direct fusion of the virus with the plasma membrane following S protein cleavage by human proteases [19] .Following entry into the cytoplasm and uncoating of the virus nucleocapsid, the viral genomic RNA is translated to produce two polypeptides, pp1a and pp1b, that form the replicase-transcriptase complex. This initial replicase-transcriptase complex uses the genomic RNA to produce 16 non-structural proteins that assemble into the replication complex. The replication complex then replicates the genomic RNA and produces other subgenomic RNAs that ensure the translation of the structural proteins.Virions are assembled at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane as viral proteins and genomic RNA are grouped together and then bud into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The virions are then exported via the secretory pathway of the endoplasmic reticulum into the Golgi intermediate compartment and then into the extracellular environment. The M protein drives the packaging process by selecting and organizing the viral envelop components at the assembly sites and interacting with the nucleocapsid to allow budding [20] ."", ""Transmission mechanisms"": ""Several large serology studies suggest that cases of asymptomatic or mild MERS-CoV infection occur regularly, although infrequently. The importance of such cases is difficult to assess [10] . It is therefore difficult to determine whether these cases are due to or take part in human-to-human transmission. Several studies suggest that less than 50% of infected patients transmit the virus to individuals they come into contact with, even at the beginning of an outbreak [10] . The disease therefore seems to spread due to frequent animal-to-human transmission, from camels to humans, with limited subsequent human-to-human transmissions [21] . There are unfortunately exceptions to this observation and local outbreaks caused by human-to-human transmission have been observed on a regular basis, mostly in hospitals. To date, the most poignant example is the outbreak that occurred in South Korea in which the index case caused 185 secondary cases, among whom 30 were care providers, leading to 24 fatalities [3] . This outbreak was characterized by the key role of a few \""super spreaders\"", delayed diagnosis, high doctor shopping behavior and the importance of confined spaces (waiting room, hospital room, ambulance). In this example, the resemblance with SARS-CoV's spreading mechanisms is striking, despite lower degrees of transmission to care providers for MERS-CoV [22] . These regular cases of imported-MERS, the most recent was reported in England in August 2018 [23] , represent a real threat of local epidemics outside Saudi Arabia and special screening and isolation procedures need to be implemented in units likely to receive patients suspected of MERS-CoV infections."", ""Preventive measures for travelers"": ""When possible, the first measure to be taken is to delay departure, in particular for individuals over 65 or with chronic disease, and for pregnant women or children. Such measures are nevertheless challenging to maintain today as that the virus is still present 6 years after its apparition.All other preventive measures aim at preventing both animalto-human transmission and human-to-human transmission. It is therefore recommended to avoid any contact with domestic animals (firstly dromedary camels), their secretions, raw milk and insufficiently cooked meat. It is also advised to avoid eating fruit and vegetables that might have been in contact with animal secretions if not washed and peeled by oneself.To avoid human-to-human transmission, the usual recommendations for preventing the spread of any respiratory virus should be applied: hand washing with soapy water or an alcohol-based solution, covering one's nose and mouth when sneezing, refraining from shaking hands and touching one's mouth and nose with one's hands, avoiding contact with people with respiratory symptoms.Finally, a last series of recommendations focus on how to behave in case of suspicious symptoms: (i) consult a doctor as soon as symptoms occur during travel and delay the return until symptoms disappear; (ii) if symptoms occur with 14 days of returning home, consult a doctor and tell him/her about the recent travel [24] ."", ""Diagnostic laboratory testing"": ""PCR-based detection methods are currently the preferred option for detecting the virus in respiratory samples and making a diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection. Serology tests can also be performed and are often used for second-line diagnostic investigation in patients with a high suspicion of MERS-CoV but negative results by direct PCR testing."", ""Direct PCR detection"": ""Various respiratory matrices can be used: nasopharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal or tracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and even in some cases, induced sputum. The deepest samples, tracheal aspirates and BALs, show the greatest sensitivity and significantly higher viral loads [25] .The genome amplification and detection methods used (PCR) were initially mostly developed in situ and performed in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) reference facilities. The time to results is generally relatively long, 24-48 h, due to the usual time required for conventional PCR testing to which must be added the additional preparation and sample neutralization time needed to protect the laboratory staff against this virus. The PCR methods used are generally semi-quantitative and some studies suggest a correlation between the amount of virus detected and the severity of the symptoms [26] . Nevertheless, no consensus has been reached yet regarding a threshold level that could actually predicts clinical severity. Targeting the envelop gene upE is recommended with confirmatory testing for ORF 1A or 1B or the N gene. If results diverge, sequencing is sometimes required to obtain conclusive results [27] . Today, an increasing number of commercial tests are becoming available (Altona Diagnostics, Fast Track Diagnostics, Primerdesing Ltd.) some even with a time to results of less than 1 hour (BioFire-bioM\u00e9rieux). Some of these tests are point-of-care, or can be performed in BSL3 facilities or a standard laboratory following sample neutralization in a BSL3 facility. These commercial tests must always be validated before use to check their sensitivity and compare their performance with reference methods."", ""Indirect serological testing"": ""As with any other acute viral infection, antibodies can only generally be detected about 10 days after the onset of symptoms. In some patients, especially those with severe infections, the time interval to antibody detection may be even longer [28] . Serological testing is therefore of little help for the initial diagnosis of symptomatic patients, but can be useful for epidemiological investigations.The highly immunogenic S and N viral proteins are widely used targets for serological tests and are found on all coronaviruses. Various approaches have been developed: serum neutralization assays [29] , microarrays [30] , or more recently ELISA confirmed by a microneutralization test [31] . All methods are technically complex and require a high level of expertise that restrict their use to a few highly specialized facilities."", ""Clinical presentation"": ""The first cases of infection with MERS-CoV were reported in 2012 [1] . Hospital-acquired MERS-CoV infections have been described worldwide and represented a third of all cases reported in Saudi Arabia in the early stages of the epidemic [1, 32, 33] . Clustered hospital-acquired infections were frequently observed during the first outbreaks and probably contributed to spreading the disease from the primary site of virus infection to the whole Arabian peninsula, the most striking example of hospital-acquired outbreak being the Korean outbreak in 2015 [34] . Care providers are often affected and represent 15-22% of cases [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] .Most of the cases are described in Middle East countries, in particular Saudi Arabia (73%), with a predominance of male patients (66-69% in various studies) and a mean patient age ranging from 40 to 55 years [34, 38, 40] .Comorbidities are found in 46-68.6% of patients, in particular diabetes and high blood pressure, followed by other heart conditions and finally obesity [34, 37, 38, 41] .The mean incubation time is 5 to 6.5 days. The generation interval (time between the onset of symptoms of the first case and those of the second case) is 7.6 days, which is identical to that of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) but threefold more than the influenza virus [36, [42] [43] [44] ."", ""Clinical symptoms"": ""The main challenge of MERS-CoV infection is the absence of specific clinical features for differential diagnosis with other viral respiratory diseases [37, 45] . This difficulty, combined with precautionary action taken to avoid potential secondary contamination with MERS-CoV [46] , can result in medical confusion and inappropriate patient management due to prolonged, difficult isolation that makes it impossible to perform the necessary complementary tests while waiting for PCR results [47] .The clinical features of MERS-CoV infection are extremely variable, ranging from an absence of symptoms (14-80% of cases) to a flu-like syndrome, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [37, 48] .The three most frequent symptoms are: fever (77% [IQR: 59-82]), cough (90% [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] ), and dyspnea (68% ).Many other secondary symptoms have been reported, such as sputum production (40%), odynophagia (39%), digestive system signs (20%), hemoptysis (4.3%), myalgia (43%) and headache (20%) [34, 37, 41, 42] .Diarrhea is significantly more frequent in patients infected with MERS-CoV than in patients with another acute, febrile respiratory conditions [45] ."", ""Severe MERS"": ""Severe MERS is characterized predominantly by ARDS, acute kidney failure, and in the most severe cases, by multiple organ failure that can be fatal [49, 50] . One third of patients develop pneumonia and 20% develop ARDS [51] .The median time to respiratory failure is 12 days after the onset of symptoms. Depending on studies, 53 to 89% of hospitalized patients are admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) [43, 52] ."", ""Fatality rate"": ""Since the first MERS outbreak, WHO had documented, in October 2018, 2260 cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed by laboratory testing and 803 related deaths in 27 different countries.The retrospective fatality rate varies between outbreaks, ranging from 36.5 to 60% [33, 35, 37, 38, 42] . The mortality rate of 20.4% observed for the Korean outbreak is probably the most reliable epidemiologically due to the comprehensive investigations carried out [34] . The death rate is highest among patients admitted to an ICU, ranging from 58% to 90% [49, 53] . In the only cohort study performed in Saudi Arabia, the fatality rate for MERS-CoV patients was of only 10% (8/80). However, the patients of this cohort were younger, had less symptoms, showed less radiological features and only 17% were admitted to an ICU [37] . The findings of the latter study diverge therefore with the situations observed in other hospitals, but are perhaps a better reflection of the infection profile in the general population in which younger subjects are less symptomatic and therefore less frequently admitted to hospital.The time interval between the onset of symptoms and death ranges from 11.5 to 27 days [34, 44, 54] .Finally, co-infection with other respiratory viruses, in particular influenza, has been described although the impact of such combined infections have not been evaluated [44, 55] . Co-infections with bacteria have also been reported in the patients developing the most severe disease [49, 51] ."", ""Laboratory findings"": ""There are no specific laboratory findings related to MERS-CoV infection. Nevertheless in patients with acute respiratory infection in MERS-endemic areas, MERS-CoV infections have been associated with normal leukocyte and/or polymorphonuclear neutrophil counts but elevated transaminases [37, 45] .Moreover, hyperleukocytosis, lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated serum creatinine, LDH and CRP levels, and hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 < 300) have been repeated reported in MERS-CoV infected patients and are associated with severity and death [34, 45] .Imaging (chest X-ray and sometimes chest CT) has revealed infection-related features in 51-75% of cases. The lesions observed are uni-or multi-focal ground glass opacifications, of subpleural and lower lobe predominance, with sometimes bilateral bi-basal involvement or features of organizing pneumonia [34, 37, 42, 45] ."", ""Risk factors for mortality"": ""Mortality is highest in elderly, male patients with comorbidities, especially diabetes [38, 45, 56] . Patients from Saudi Arabia and the Middle East have an increased mortality rate compared with patients from Korea or other countries [38, 40] . In contrast, being a medical professional significantly reduces the risk of mortality [38, 45] .Other factors associated with a higher mortality risk have been described in various studies: digestive symptoms, prolonged delay between the onset of symptoms and admission to hospital, smoking, low blood pressure, impaired gas exchange, leukopenia, anemia, disturbance of liver or kidney function, use of mechanical ventilation and prolonged stay in the ICU [42, 57] .For the Korean outbreak in 2015, the independent risk factors for mortality were: age > 55 years, dyspnea, diabetes, chronic lung disease, systolic blood pressure at admission < 90 mmHg, hyperleukocytosis at admission (> 10,000/mm 3 ) and the use of mechanical ventilation [34] ."", ""Risk factors for severe MERS"": ""Positive PCR results for MERS-CoV in blood at diagnosis are associated with an increased risk of requiring mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or to lead to death [58, 59] .The lack or delayed detection of MERS antibodies (ELISA IgG and IgA, or PRNT) in the blood or airways is a poor prognostic factor [54, 60] . It should however be noted that no seroconversion is observed in asymptomatic MERS-infected patients [54] . Finally, the MERS-CoV viral loads in distal lung samples were higher among deceased patients [60] .In a study including 45 patients in a tertiary referral hospital in South Korea:\u2022 the predictive factors for pneumonia in MERS-CoV patients were: age > 45 years, body temperature > 37.5 \u2022 C on day 3, platelet counts < 150,000/mm 3 , lymphocytopenia (< 1000/mm 3 ), CRP \u2265 20 mg/L and high viral loads (Ct value < 28.5); \u2022 the predictive factors for respiratory failure were male sex, high blood pressure, thrombocytopenia, lymphocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia < 35 g/L and CRP \u2265 40 mg/L.The patients with at least two, one and none of the predictive pneumonia factors developed pneumonia in 100%, 50% and 0% of cases, respectively [61] ."", ""Treatment of MERS"": ""Several therapeutic options targeting various viral elements are currently available or under development (Fig. 4) [62] . The different classes of available treatment are (i) immunotherapy with specific anti-MERS-CoV antibodies, (ii) molecules with antiviral activity, (iii) symptomatic treatment. Few molecules have shown real curative action and the reports in the literature generally describe isolated cases or small series of cases. More studies have focused on associated treatment and supportive care. At this time, preventive therapies are still in preclinical stages."", ""Convalescent plasma"": ""The efficacy and safety of plasma from convalescent patients have not been assessed.

Recently, a phase I placebo-controlled, dose escalation study evaluated the efficacy of polyclonal IgGs produced by transchromosomal cattle with human immunoglobulin genes immunized with the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein [65] . The primary outcome of tolerance to a single dose was reached. The secondary pharmacodynamic endpoint (serum neutralization activity) showed efficacy with a dose of 50 mg/kg.

No clinical data or studies support its use in vivo at the present time."", ""Corticosteroids"": ""Corticosteroid therapy is currently the most widely studied therapeutic option. In a retrospective study, Arabi et al. [67] compared the outcome of 309 patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection managed in an ICU setting and treated with (151) or without (159) corticosteroid therapy. The overall fatality rate was 67%. Univariate analysis showed that mortality in the ICU, during the hospital stay or at 90 days was higher in the corticosteroid group. Then, following adjustment using a marginal structural model for causal inference, corticosteroid therapy was shown not to be associated with mortality, but delayed virus clearance. These findings, together with the absence of any description of the adverse effects caused by corticosteroid treatment, argue against the use of corticosteroids."", ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)"": ""A retrospective study was recently carried out in Saudi Arabia in MERS-CoV patients with refractory respiratory failure [74] .

Secondary endpoints included the length of stay in the ICU and in hospital. Thirty-five patients were included: 17 were treated with ECMO and 18 received conventional care. Both groups had similar baseline characteristics. Inhospital mortality was lower in the ECMO group (65 vs. 100%; P = 0.02) although they stayed longer in the ICU (median stay of 25 days vs. 8 days; P < 0.01). The overall time in hospital was similar in both groups (median stay of 41 vs. 31 days; P = 0.421).

It uses a chimpanzee adenovirus vector containing the MERS-CoV S protein gene [75] . Patient inclusion is currently underway. Many other candidate vaccines using various different technologies are at a less advanced stage of development."", ""Conclusions"": ""The MERS epidemic started in 2012. In contrast with SARS-CoV that disappeared 2 years after it first appeared, MERS-CoV continues to persist in the Middle East 6 years later. Although the disease has not become pandemic, outbreaks have occurred worldwide. Today, it is impossible to predict with certainty whether MERS-CoV will disappear or continue to remain a threat for human populations. Efficient vaccine development for host ani-mals and humans could play a key role in tilting the balance from potentially-pandemic to MERS-CoV elimination. Furthermore, the epidemiological and viral determinants of the emergence of MERS-CoV in the Middle East are difficult to comprehend, due to the high seropositivity rate of African dromedary camels but no similar disease in local human populations.The constant increase of transcontinental travel, in particular towards the main focal points of MERS outbreaks with religious pilgrimages and mass tourism, raises the problem of the management of patients suspected of MERS-CoV infection and the absence of efficient treatment options to this date. The main problem in non-epidemic countries is to detect a MERS-CoV case among a great number of non-MERS patients. In France, with the exception of the first 2 cases, no further cases have been detected. The current strategy is to isolate any suspicious cases as rapidly as possible to contain the infection and prevent local outbreaks as seen in South Korea. The ability to rapidly test patients suspected to have MERS-CoV infection is the cornerstone of this strategy. The experience gained over the last few years by the health community will also help deal with any respiratory infections that will emerge in the future."", ""Disclosure of interest"": ""The authors declare that they have no competing interest.""}",Focus on Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),"Since the first case of human infection by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia in June 2012, more than 2260 cases of confirmed MERS-CoV infection and 803 related deaths have been reported since the 16th of October 2018. The vast majority of these cases (71%) were reported in Saudi Arabia but the epidemic has now spread to 27 countries and has not ceased 6 years later, unlike SARS-CoV that disappeared a little less than 2 years after emerging. Due to the high fatality rate observed in MERS-CoV infected patients (36%), much effort has been put into understanding the origin and pathophysiology of this novel coronavirus to prevent it from becoming endemic in humans. This review focuses in particular on the origin, epidemiology and clinical manifestations of MERS-CoV, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of infected patients. The experience gained over recent years on how to manage the different risks related to this kind of epidemic will be key to being prepared for future outbreaks of communicable disease.",10.1016/j.medmal.2019.10.004,Elsevier; Medline; PMC; WHO,PMC7125975,31727466.0,no-cc,2019-11-11,Med Mal Infect,,#155267,,208037377.0,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X19310546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31727466/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medmal.2019.10.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X19310546,2019.0,paper

With these benefits comes the risk of pathogen transmission via the transfused blood components, making the supply of safe blood components a key mission of blood transfusion services. The introduction of screening tests for blood products strongly reduced the burden of known blood-borne pathogens such as hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, cases of HBV and HIV transmission via blood from infected donors, which were not detected by serological screening or nucleic acid testing (NAT), have been described recently (Candotti et al., 2018; Cappy et al., 2019) . In addition, other known or unknown pathogens pose a potential threat to blood safety, with regional differences. The number of different pathogen screening tests applied in blood banks is usually limited by economic factors and availability of reliable and affordable assays. Thus, an efficacious pathogen inactivation technology is a viable alternative to serological or NAT testing as the risk of transmission of a broad spectrum of pathogens can be reduced. It also reduces the need for implementing additional screening tests if proven efficient (Prowse, 2013) ."", ""INTERCEPT inactivation of MERS-CoV in platelets 435"": ""The Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been described as an endemic zoonotic pathogen in Saudi Arabia and other countries of the Arabian Peninsula since 2012 (Zaki et al., 2012) . Dromedary camels are the most likely animal reservoir, and the virus can spread from animals and cause human infections (Azhar et al., 2014) . As of late May 2019, 2425 confirmed infections, including 838 deaths (\u223c34\u00b76% mortality rate), have been reported in 27 countries. The majority of confirmed cases (2037 total) were reported from Saudi Arabia, with a mortality rate of \u223c37\u00b75% (WHO, 2019: https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). Symptoms of MERS infections vary from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia (Zaki et al., 2012; Mackay & Arden, 2015) . Older age and comorbidities are the highest risk factors for the development of severe symptoms, such as extra-pulmonary manifestations and severe pneumonia, often leading to fatal outcomes (Almekhlafi et al., 2016) . Hospital and community outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and South Korea were reported as a result of nosocomial transmissions due to close contact with patients (Shehata et al., 2016; Arabi et al., 2017) . Underreporting of asymptomatic cases is presumed, and thus, the real number of infected patients is likely to be much higher than the number of reported and confirmed cases (Lessler et al., 2016) , which together with mild cases may facilitate the spread of the virus and pose a possible risk for blood safety. Higher seropositivity in camel workers compared to the general population has been reported (M\u00fcller et al., 2015; Alshukairi et al., 2018) . Therefore, asymptomatic donors may donate blood while they potentially carry the virus.MERS-CoV genomic RNA was detected in respiratory, serum, plasma, urine and stool samples from infected patients (Memish et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2016; Min et al., 2016) . The detection of MERS-CoV viral RNA in plasma and serum was reported in around 30% of patients, and those cases were associated with more severe disease (Corman et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2016; Min et al., 2016) . CoVs are mainly transmitted via droplets, fomites, person-to-person contact and direct or indirect contact with zoonotic sources. Transfusion-transmitted MERS-CoV infections have not been reported so far (Stramer, 2014) ; however, the detection of viral RNA in the plasma and serum of acutely infected patients raises the possibility of such concern in endemic areas such as the Arabian Peninsula. Thus, use of pathogen inactivation technology may be crucial to prevent transfusion-transmitted MERS-CoV infections during an outbreak and could be implemented proactively in the prevision of potential outbreaks.The INTERCEPT\u2122 Blood System technology inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses and protozoa, in platelet concentrates prepared for transfusion (Schlenke, 2014) . Using amotosalen (a photoactive compound) and UVA light, pathogens' genomes are modified in a targeted and specific manner by cross-linking the genomic strands, preventing transcription and replication without affecting the platelet efficacy and patient safety as demonstrated in clinical evaluations (Cid et al., 2012) , national routine observations (Jutzi et al., 2018) and by haemovigilance data from multiple countries (Benjamin et al., 2017) . As an additional effect, residual white blood cells of the donor are inactivated more efficiently than by gamma irradiation (Castro et al., 2018) , reducing the risk of immunological transfusion reactions and transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GvHD). The INTERCEPT Blood System is currently the only FDA-approved pathogen reduction system for platelets. Although we have recently shown that INTERCEPT treatment can efficiently inactivate MERS-CoV in human plasma (Hindawi et al., 2018) , there have been no data so far for the inactivation of MERS-CoV with INTERCEPT treatment in platelets. Here, we extend this work to evaluate inactivation of MERS-CoV in human apheresis platelet concentrates with INTERCEPT treatment. "", ""Platelet preparation"": ""Apheresis platelet units in 100% donor plasma (\u223c380 mL, 4.6 \u00d7 10 11 platelets per unit) were collected at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Transfusion Services, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, from voluntary donors using a Trima\u2122 apheresis collection unit (Terumo BCT, Japan). The platelets were stored at 20-22 \u2218 C under continuous agitation. All platelet units were screened routinely for HCV-Ab/Ag, HBs-Ag, HBc-Ab, HIV (1/2)-Ab, HTLV (1/2)-Ab and syphilis, as well as for HCV, HBV and HIV by NAT. Donors were also confirmed to be negative for MERS-CoV-neutralising antibodies. After baseline sampling, the remaining volume was \u223c360 mL, and the remaining platelet count was \u223c4.4 \u00d7 10 11 ."", ""MERS-CoV inactivation"": ""Four units (A-D) of platelets were used in this study. Each platelet unit was inoculated with MERS-CoV stock in a 1:100 dilution. Platelet units were treated with the INTERCEPT Large Volume Processing Set and an INTERCEPT Illuminator (Cerus Corporation, U.S.A.). Residual amotosalen and free photoproducts were removed using the integrated compound adsorption device according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following samples were collected for testing: a positive control sample from the virus stock, a negative control sample from the platelets before inoculation with the virus, pre-treatment sample from the inoculated platelets and a sample from the treated platelets "", ""Detection of replicative MERS-CoV"": ""Detection of replicative MERS-CoV in INTERCEPT-treated platelets was performed as previously described with minor modifications (Pinna et al., 2005; Hindawi et al., 2018) . Briefly, collected pre-treatment and inactivated samples were diluted at 1:10 dilution in DMEM with 10% FBS containing heparin sulphate (5 U/mL), inoculated on Vero E6 cells in 6-well plates in duplicates and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u2218 C. Inoculum was then removed and replaced with 2 mL of DMEM with 10% FBS and incubated for 3 or 9 days at 37 \u2218 C. On day three post-inoculation, supernatants were collected from plates, diluted at 1:10 in DMEM with 10% FBS and re-inoculated on Vero E6 cells for two more successive passages. Supernatants collected from each passage were also used for viral load quantification by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In some experiments, plates were maintained for up to nine days after inoculation and were observed for cytopathic effect (CPE) to ensure the absence of any residual infectious viruses."", ""Plaque assay"": ""Plaque assay was performed as previously described (Hindawi et al., 2018) with a minor modification. Briefly, samples were serially diluted in DMEM with 10% FBS containing heparin sulphate (5 U/mL) starting from 1:10, and 1 mL from each dilution was inoculated on confluent Vero E6 cell monolayers and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u2218 C. Then, the inoculum was removed and replaced by overlay media (DMEM with 0\u00b78% agarose) and incubated for 3 days at 37 \u2218 C. After incubation, cells were stained with Neutral Red for 4 h at 37 \u2218 C, and plaques were counted to calculate titre as plaque-forming unit (pfu)/mL."", ""RT-qPCR quantitation"": ""Viral RNA was extracted from all samples collected directly from the platelet units (positive, negative, pre-treatment and post-treatment samples), as well as from the cell supernatants using the Qiagen Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative quantification of MERS-CoV viral load was performed as previously described (Hashem et al., 2019) with some modifications. In brief, one-step real-time RT-qPCR was conducted using MERS-CoV-specific primers and probes targeting the upstream region of the E gene (upE) and QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Germany) on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. Ct value for each replicate of each sample was analysed against Ct values of a standard curve of MERS-CoV with known mRNA copy number. The viral load was expressed as the equivalent of log 10 equivalents per mL (TCID 50 eq/mL) and compared to that of the pre-treatment sample. Each run included a positive viral template control and no-template negative control. Each sample was tested in duplicate, and the mean is reported as TCID 50 eq/mL."", ""IRB approval"": ""The study was approved by the biomedical ethics committee unit of the King Abdulaziz University Hospital (approval# 257-16)."", ""Inactivation of MERS-CoV in human platelet concentrates"": ""We spiked four units (A-D) of human platelets collected from healthy donors with MERS-CoV. Spiked units were then treated ND, not detected. with amotosalen and UVA light. Mean infectious viral titre in pre-treatment samples from the four units was 4\u00b748 \u00b1 0\u00b73 log 10 pfu/mL (range: 4\u00b718-4\u00b785 log 10 pfu/mL) (Table 1) . Treatment of spiked units resulted in a mean reduction of 4\u00b748 \u00b1 0\u00b73 log 10 pfu/mL as no infectious virus was detected by plaque assay (Table 1 ). Fig. 2 shows representative plaque assay results for all tested units. As expected, testing of negative control samples collected before spiking with MERS-CoV showed no replication-competent virus. Of note, the viral infectivity titre in the positive controls had a mean of 7\u00b777 \u00b1 0\u00b733 log 10 pfu/mL (range: 7\u00b730-8\u00b708 log 10 pfu/mL), and it was reduced to 4\u00b748 \u00b1 0\u00b73 log 10 pfu/mL (range: 4\u00b718-4\u00b785 log 10 pfu/mL) on spiking of platelets units, which is lower than the expected dilution of 1:100 by >1 log as we previously observed in plasma (Hindawi et al., 2018) , suggesting that platelets and/or plasma may have an impact on the MERS-CoV infectivity titre, most probably due to non-specific inhibition as the used samples were negative for MERS-CoV antibodies."", ""Impact of pathogen inactivation treatment on MERS-CoV genomic titre"": ""To further confirm these results, the viral genomic titre was determined for all collected samples. As shown in Table 2 , positive controls and pre-treatment samples from all units had a log 10 TCID 50 eq/mL equivalent to the infectious viral titre determined by plaque assay as shown in Table 1 . Importantly, post-treatment samples showed viral genomic titres that were only slightly reduced compared to titres in the pre-treatment samples. These results suggest that amotosalen and UVA light inactivated infectious viruses without any significant effect on the viral genomic titres as shown before for MERS-CoV, dengue virus and Zika virus (Musso et al., 2014; Santa Maria et al., 2017; Hindawi et al., 2018) ."", ""Passaging of INTERCEPT-treated platelet concentrates to confirm complete inactivation"": ""To exclude the possibility of any residual replicating MERS-CoV associated with the presence of viral genomic titres in the treated platelet units (Table 2) , we inoculated the collected samples on Vero E6 cells and evaluated infectivity over three successive passages. Although culture of all pre-treatment samples ND, not detected. 1 Data are shown as log 10 TCID 50 eq/mL. 2 Titres were determined from the same samples used in Table 1. showed complete CPE within 3 days post-inoculation, similar to that of the positive control, no CPE was observed in cells inoculated with inactivated samples similar to negative and Table 1 were used in this experiment. Samples were used at 1:10 dilution, and titre was determined on day 3 post-inoculation.mock controls (Fig. 3 ) even after nine days of incubation in all three passages. For further confirmation, we determined the viral genomic titres from supernatants collected from all passages inoculated with either pre-treatment or post-treatment samples. As shown in Table 3 , passaging of pre-treatment samples led to viral replication and an increase in viral titres upon passaging. On the other hand, viral infectivity titres in cells inoculated with inactivated samples decreased to lower or undetectable levels in culture supernatants. Together, these data confirm the complete inactivation of MERS-CoV in the tested platelets units and the absence of a replication-competent virus post-inactivation."", ""DISCUSSION"": ""Outbreaks of emerging pathogens pose a high risk for blood safety as screening tests are often not available, and their occurrence, spread and impact are difficult to predict, making it hard to implement safety measures appropriately and in a timely manner. Recently, a chikungunya virus outbreak in Italy severely impacted blood availability in the Lazio region, causing an officially demanded halt in platelet supply. Only those centres in the region that had the INTERCEPT technology implemented were allowed to continue platelet product preparation and could thus prevent a complete stop in platelet supply by supporting the hospitals of the entire region (Vairo et al., 2018) . The Italian outbreak, the second after the Ravenna outbreak in 2008, was yet another example of recent emerging arbovirus outbreaks in the Mediterranean, likely enabled by the spread of vectors due to global warming or increased international travel and goods exchange. The 2015/2016 Zika virus outbreak in South and Central America is another example where the high number of asymptomatic carriers made it difficult to protect the blood supply (Lanteri et al., 2016) . Although, to the best of our knowledge, transmission of MERS-CoV by blood transfusion has not yet been reported, the detection of MERS-CoV genomic RNA in the blood of infected patients raises concerns for blood safety (Stramer, 2014) . Viral genomic RNA was detected in the plasma and serum of patients during MERS-CoV outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and South Korea, giving rise to concerns about potential transmission by blood transfusion. A viral load of 3\u00b73-4\u00b72 log genomic copies per mL in whole blood and 2\u00b77-4\u00b70 log genomic copies per mL in serum was reported in South Korea (Kim et al., 2016) . Viral loads up to 6 log genomic copies per mL, which correspond to \u223c3 logs of infectious virus, in serum have also been reported during an outbreak in Saudi Arabia (Corman et al., 2016) . Although there are no reports on transfusion-related MERS-CoV transmission so far, viral RNA could be detected in patients' blood for almost two weeks post-diagnosis (Corman et al., 2016) , which may represent a possible route of transmission, especially that several studies have shown its replication in several blood cells (Chu et al., , 2016 Zhou et al., 2014) . Furthermore, the AABB lists MERS-CoV as a pathogen of concern for blood safety (Stramer, 2014) . Therefore, it is important to investigate possible ways to reduce the risk of such transmission to avoid any effects on the blood supply, especially in endemic regions such as Saudi Arabia, which could lead to deferral of donations from confirmed and suspected cases as happened before during the SARS-CoV outbreak (WHO, 2019: https://www.who.int/csr/ sars/guidelines/bloodsafety/en/).We have previously described the inactivation of MERS-CoV in spiked human plasma samples (Hindawi et al., 2018) with an average of 4\u00b767 log reduction in infectious titre on amotosalen/UVA treatment. In this study, we report a mean of 4\u00b748 log (4\u00b718-4\u00b785) reduction in the infectious titre of MERS-CoV in virus-spiked platelet samples, indicating that amotosalen/UVA treatment of MERS-CoV-spiked platelets can effectively inactivate the virus and potentially reduce the risk of MERS-CoV transmission through contaminated platelet units. This reduction is at least one log higher than the possible infectious titre in serum as reported previously (Corman et al., 2016) . Of note, the inactivation mechanism of the INTERCEPT treatment depends on cross-linking of nucleic acid strands, thereby preventing pathogen replication. Given the size of the amplicon, the detection of the viral genomic RNA by RT-qPCR was still possible after inactivation, and the genomic titre was only slightly affected by the pathogen inactivation treatment. This finding is not unusual as previously reported for other successfully inactivated viruses. Specifically, amotosalen/UVA light inactivation process results in cross-linking of the pathogen nucleic acid strands in a sequence-specific manner where an adduct is formed in the nucleic acids, thus inhibiting transcription and replication. However, this cross-linking is not necessarily at the site targeted by the RT-PCR. Thus, treatment is expected to affect viral replication, but the nucleic acid will remain detectable, which explains why the genomic titres are not reduced in a similar fashion as the infectivity reduction. Nonetheless, for additional safety, we assessed the presence of residual replication-competent particles. Inactivated platelet units were passaged three successive times for three days each, showing no CPE in the inactivated units. Viral genomes were also not detected after nine days (three passages), showing the loss of replication-incompetent particles during passaging and confirming the total inactivation of all viral particles in the treated platelet units.One major limitation of this study was the use of only four human platelets units, and subsequent studies should include larger number of samples. Although the addition of amotosalen alone without UVA light did not reduce viral titre in spiked samples (data not shown), the effect of the adsorption step alone without amotosalen and UVA light was not tested in this study and should be included in subsequent work to further determine the effect of all steps in the inactivation process. In addition, future studies should also investigate the possible effect of amotosalen and UVA light treatment on viral particles as inactivation may also be occurring via a path not directly associated with genomic alteration, such as covalent cross-linking of viral proteins or oxidative reactions induced by singlet oxygen generation from the process. Furthermore, possible virus attachment and adherence to platelets or even internalisation by platelets should be further tested. Nonetheless, our data show that the whole inactivation process is effective in reducing the risk of virus transmission via transfusion.A recent study has reported a reduction of \u22653\u00b77 log of MERS-CoV in spiked platelets prepared in 65% PAS and 35% plasma using UVC light (Eickmann et al., 2018) . In addition, a minimum reduction of \u22653\u00b73 or \u2265 4\u00b707 logs of MERS-CoV in plasma has been reported using methylene blue with visible light (Eickmann et al., 2018) or riboflavin with UV light (Keil et al., 2016) , respectively. Although all these reports have shown marked reduction in infectious viral titres, which represent an acceptable safety margin according to the European Committee of Blood Transfusion, the presence of remaining or low levels of replication-competent virus after treatment should be investigated to confirm the complete inactivation of the virus. In addition, it would be interesting to observe the effect of these inactivation treatments on genomic viral load to correlate the results to the mean genomic titres of MERS-CoV in patients."", ""CONCLUSION"": ""In this study, we showed efficient inactivation of MERS-CoV isolate spiked in human platelet concentrates in 100% plasma with amotosalen/UVA. Complete inactivation with a mean of 4\u00b748 \u00b1 0\u00b73 log reduction of viral titre was confirmed by passaging experiments, excluding the remaining replication-competent particles. This technology represents an efficient method to reduce the possible risk associated with MERS-CoV, as well as other viruses, which may be transmitted via blood transfusion.""}",Amotosalen and ultraviolet A light efficiently inactivate MERS‐coronavirus in human platelet concentrates,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of the INTERCEPT™ Blood System [amotosalen/ultraviolet A (UVA) light] to reduce the risk of Middle East respiratory syndrome‐Coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) transmission by human platelet concentrates. BACKGROUND: Since 2012, more than 2425 MERS‐CoV human cases have been reported in 27 countries. The infection causes acute respiratory disease, which was responsible for 838 deaths in these countries, mainly in Saudi Arabia. Viral genomic RNA was detected in whole blood, serum and plasma of infected patients, raising concerns of the safety of blood supplies, especially in endemic areas. METHODS: Four apheresis platelet units in 100% plasma were inoculated with a clinical MERS‐CoV isolate. Spiked units were then treated with amotosalen/UVA to inactivate MERS‐CoV. Infectious and genomic viral titres were quantified by plaque assay and quantitative real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR). Inactivated samples were successively passaged thrice on Vero E6 cells to exclude the presence of residual replication‐competent viral particles in inactivated platelets. RESULTS: Complete inactivation of MERS‐CoV in spiked platelet units was achieved by treatment with Amotosalen/UVA light with a mean log reduction of 4·48 ± 0·3. Passaging of the inactivated samples in Vero E6 showed no viral replication even after nine days of incubation and three passages. Viral genomic RNA titration in inactivated samples showed titres comparable to those in pre‐treatment samples. CONCLUSION: Amotosalen and UVA light treatment of MERS‐CoV‐spiked platelet concentrates efficiently and completely inactivated MERS‐CoV infectivity (>4 logs), suggesting that such treatment could minimise the risk of transfusion‐related MERS‐CoV transmission.",10.1111/tme.12638,Medline; PMC,PMC7169717,31696565.0,no-cc,2019-11-06,Transfus Med,,,,207935873.0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696565/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tme.12638,2019.0,paper

[1] [2] [3] In a series of 214 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 from the Chinese city of Wuhan, ischaemic stroke was reported in 2.8% of patients, rising to 5.7% in the subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 (n = 88). These patients showed significantly higher D-dimer levels, which suggests that hypercoagulability may have caused stroke in these patients. 2 According to data from the COVID-19 registry created by the Spanish Society of Neurology, 4 ischaemic stroke is the second most frequent neurological disorder in these patients (22.8%), following confusional syndrome (28.3%). A recent study described the cases of 3 patients with COVID-19 who presented ischaemic stroke and antiphospholipid antibodies, in addition to elevated D-dimer levels and laboratory markers of systemic inflammation. 5 Insufficient evidence is available to determine whether determine whether hypercoagulability secondary to COVID-19 presents a causal association with ischaemic stroke. To help clarify this matter, we describe 4 patients attended at our hospital due to ischaemic stroke and COVID-19 and present a literature review on the subject."", ""Methods"": ""We describe 4 consecutive patients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19 who were attended between 25 March and 17 April 2020 at a reference centre. The study was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of the Spanish province of Granada. Due to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, patients and/or their legal representatives were informed about the study and gave informed consent by telephone."", ""J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f"": ""We gathered the following data: demographic variables, clinical data at admission, COVID-19related clinical variables at admission, stroke-related variables, laboratory data at the time of stroke, and data on clinical progression. Stroke aetiology was determined using the TOAST classification criteria. 6 Patients were classified according to the likelihood of a causal relationship between hypercoagulability secondary to COVID-19 and ischaemic stroke.We also conducted a review of studies addressing the possible causal association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and ischaemic stroke. Table 1 provides clinical and complementary data on the 4 patients included (see also Supplementary material for images and Appendix 1 for a description of the 4 cases), as well as stroke aetiology and likelihood of causation due to hypercoagulability secondary to COVID-19."", ""Discussion"": ""Acute COVID-19 comprises 3 stages: early infection, pulmonary involvement, and severe hyperinflammation. [7] [8] [9] In some patients, the inflammatory response is highly pronounced, triggering a \""cytokine storm\"" and considerable T cell activation, 10 with high levels of such laboratory markers as IL-6, ferritin, and C-reactive protein; these findings are associated with high mortality rates. 11 The cytokine storm causes endothelial dysfunction, 9, [12] [13] [14] which may also be favoured by direct viral invasion of endothelial cells through interaction between coronavirus S protein and ACE2 receptors, expressed in the capillary endothelium. 15 Endothelial dysfunction increases thrombin synthesis and decreases fibrinolysis, contributing to a hypercoagulable state; this may explain the high rate of thrombotic complications observed in series of patients with COVID-19. 8, 16 Elevated D-dimer levels in these patients have therefore been proposed as a marker of hypercoagulability and poor prognosis. 11, 17 Hypercoagulable state has been suggested as an aetiopathogenic mechanism of stroke in patients with severe COVID-19, given that these patients present higher D-dimer levels. 2, 13 This hypothesis was already considered during the 2002-2004 SARS-CoV epidemic, as ischaemic stroke was observed in middle-aged individuals with few vascular risk factors and severe infection. 16 Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 present a high binding affinity for ACE2. 7 A recent study reported 3 cases of severe COVID-19 and ischaemic stroke; these patients presented antiphospholipid antibodies and laboratory findings compatible with systemic inflammation and coagulopathy. 5 Antiphospholipid antibodies constitute the laboratory hallmark of primary antiphospholipid syndrome, but have also been detected in other systemic inflammatory diseases and viral infections, and are associated with higher risk of thromboembolic complications. 18 In patients with severe COVID-19, other aetiopathogenic mechanisms of ischaemic stroke should be considered, including cardioembolism secondary to myocardial infarction or haemodynamic mechanisms secondary to cardiogenic or septic shock. 16 Microangiopathy associated with endothelial dysfunction has also been proposed as a pathogenic mechanism of ischaemia. 19 In patients 1 and 2 of our series (Table 1) , the likelihood of a causal relationship between COVID-19 and stroke is high, as these patients presented laboratory markers of systemic inflammation and hypercoagulability and the aetiological study found no evident cause for ischaemic stroke. Patient 1 presented cortical infarction in the absence of artery disease or emboligenic heart disease. Patient 2 presented stroke during hospitalisation, despite treatment with heparin at a prophylactic dose. As reported previously, these findings support the hypothesis of hypercoagulability as a possible cause of ischaemic stroke in patients with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f COVID-19 and significant coagulopathy. 2, 5 However, ischaemic stroke may be caused by multiple, complex pathogenic mechanisms, particularly in patients with respiratory involvement. In view of the current pandemic, aetiological studies often cannot be completed or are delayed. 20 This underscores the need for consensus documents and adaptations to current stroke management plans, as in the recently published Madrid stroke care plan recommendations. 21 In patients 3 and 4, the likelihood that COVID-19 caused stroke was low, for several reasons. Firstly, these patients were of advanced age and had multiple comorbidities; SARS-CoV-2 infection was an incidental finding, and stroke was most likely cardioembolic. Furthermore, in both cases, stroke presented with neurological signs; no symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection were observed at stroke onset. These cases show that copresence of COVID-19 and ischaemic stroke does not always imply a causal relationship; therefore, detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection should not interfere with the aetiological study of ischaemic stroke. 20, 21 Patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation should receive prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin; higher doses should be administered to critically ill patients and those at high risk of thrombosis. 13, 22 A recent study reported lower mortality rates among patients treated with prophylactic doses of heparin who presented D-dimer levels 6 times greater than the upper limit of normal (> 3 mg/L) or a Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy score \u2265 4. 13 This scoring system considers prothrombin time, platelet count, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and has been proposed as a tool for early detection of sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation. 23 However, in patients with ischaemic stroke and SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting coagulopathy and hyperinflammation, early treatment with intermediateor therapeutic-dose heparin is controversial due to the associated risk of haemorrhagic transformation. 24 In fact, insufficient evidence is available to recommend early anticoagulation therapy 20, 24 : the decision should be made on an individual basis based on the presence of a prothrombotic state and/or systemic inflammation, stroke size, and the risk-benefit balance.Our study does present several limitations, mainly the small size of the patient series, our limited experience with managing patients with stroke and COVID-19, the difficulties of diagnosing and treating these patients during the pandemic, and the limited scientific evidence on ischaemic stroke in patients with COVID-19."", ""Conclusions"": ""The hypercoagulable state associated with the hyperinflammatory response triggered by COVID-19 may be considered a potential cause of ischaemic stroke. However, stroke in these patients may involve numerous pathogenic mechanisms; studies with larger samples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and evaluate the role of endothelial damage secondary to viral invasion. Patients with stroke and COVID-19 should undergo a complete aetiological study, with the appropriate safety precautions always being observed. There is currently no evidence of the benefits of early anticoagulation therapy after ischaemic stroke in patients with COVID-19 and hypercoagulability. Future studies, ideally clinical trials, are needed to provide more robust evidence supporting the use of anticoagulants in these patients. Meanwhile, the risk-benefit balance of this treatment should be assessed on an individual basis."", ""Conflicts of interest"": ""The authors of this study have no conflicts of interest to declare.

Along with pulmonary complications, inhalation injury is responsible for up to 77% of all deaths following burn injury and is most often a consequence of carbon monoxide poisoning [4, 5] . Smoke inhalation is present in 2-30% of all flame burn injuries; however, mucosal injury at the level of the vocal folds as a result of inhaled heat is rare [6] .The management of the burn patient with concomitant inhalation injury is widely accepted to be complex. Inhalation injury is well known to be an independent risk factor for mortality and is also associated with significant morbidity, which may be observed as early or late sequelae [7, 8] . Immediately following inhalation injury, risk of respiratory distress and airway compromise frequently necessitate the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Patients with significant airway involvement of their burn often develop direct mucosal injury to the respiratory tract, mucosal sloughing, and inflammation ( Fig. 1) , potentially leading to airway obstruction and impaired gas exchange. These physiological changes in addition to higher fluid resuscitation requirements lead to an increased risk for pulmonary and airway oedema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and therefore longer duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) [9] . Potential late consequences of inhalation injury may also occur. These may evidence as scarring, contracture and stenosis or stricture of the mucosal tissue, with subsequent impacts on physiological function of those structures affected [10] .Due to the early and potentially long-term damage to the laryngeal and pharyngeal structures, dysphagia and dysphonia are not uncommon in this population. It is already known that dysphagia is a common consequence of burn injury (\u00b1 inhalation injury), with the prevalence rate of dysphagia following thermal burn injury in the adult population documented to be 11.18% in the general adult population [11] and up to 46.97% in the aged (\u2265 75 years) burn population [12] . A number of predictive factors for dysphagia development post burns have also been identified [11] and subsequently validated [13] . These factors, with consideration to advancing age, include the presence of head and neck burns, total burn surface area (TBSA) \u2265 18%, need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, and presence of tracheostomyand inhalation injury. However, whilst inhalation injury has been identified as a predictor for dysphagia and its complications, the incidence and severity of dysphagia, and the pattern of recovery specifically in the subset of patients with burn injury and associated inhalation injury are not well understood.Dysphagia following burn injury, not specifically with an inhalation component, has been characterised as presenting with deficits in both the motor as well as sensory aspects of swallowing function with onset evident early in the acute admission. In many cases, complete recovery can be achieved prior to hospital discharge [14, 15] , although a small proportion of patients will experience more severe swallowing impairment with a lengthy and at times incomplete recovery [14, 16] . Initiation of oral intake following burn injury has been documented to take longer in patients identified with dysphagia than in those without [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] with lengthy periods of enteral nutrition often necessary. Resolution of dysphagia after burn injury also follows a variable, and sometimes protracted period of recovery. Burn patients, identified with dysphagia, have been reported to take between 1 and 222 days to achieve their premorbid swallowing function as defined by reaching premorbid oral diet and fluids and no longer requiring the aid of supplementary nutrition, therapeutic or compensatory manoeuvres [14-16, 18, 20] .Examination of dysphagia severity in a large cohort (n = 438) of patients following thermal burn injury, of which 6.85% were identified as having concomitant inhalation injury, has revealed that 41% presented with severe dysphagia at the point of initial swallowing assessment [14] . However, no specific sub-analysis of those patients with or without inhalation injury was conducted to determine any differential patterns of dysphagia severity. Considering that increased dysphagia severity and duration to recovery has also been connected to other factors necessary to managing inhalation injury, including endotracheal tube size and duration of intubation and tracheostomy [11, 13, [24] [25] [26] [27] , it is possible that dysphagia severity in this cohort will be even higher than in the head and neck burn population. The application of enteral feeding following burn injury is also necessary, not only as an adjunct to managing nutritional sequelae associated with dysphagia alone but also to ensure adequate nourishment to facilitate wound healing, physical and psychological rehabilitation [28] . Duration of enteral feeding in the general thermal burns population has been shown to be lengthy and often extends beyond the time that dysphagia has resolved [14] [15] [16] 23] . Again, there is high probability this also will be protracted in those with concomitant inhalation injury.The presence of dysphagia post thermal burn injury has been reported to be connected with increased hospital length of stay, morbidity and mortality as well as requiring increased periods of Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) intervention [12, 14] . Consequently, the literature to date clearly describes that dysphagia is a considerable issue with substantial contribution to the burden of treatment for a patient with thermal burn injury. Although data detailing the presentation and clinical progression of dysphagia for the general burn population are developing, and predictive factors including inhalation injury have been identified, clinical details regarding the incidence and clinical progression in the subset of patients who also present with inhalation injury are lacking. The aim of this study was therefore, to determine the incidence of dysphagia and describe the clinical profile of swallowing function for those admitted with inhalation burn injury, and contrast this with known patterns of recovery for those without inhalation injury post burn."", ""Participants"": ""The model of care for severe burn injury is centralised to key specialist services within each state/territory in Australia. The NSW Statewide Burn Injury Service (SBIS) at Concord Repatriation General Hospital (CRGH) campus receives all patients in accordance with the Australian and New Zealand Burns Association (ANZBA) transfer guidelines, which includes those patients with cutaneous burn injury and concomitant inhalation burn injury. Within the SBIS at CRGH, SLP services are an integrated part of the multidisciplinary care team and a blanket referral system is in place to see all patients fulfilling a set of criteria inclusive of head and neck burns, suspected inhalation injury, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, concomitant neurological injury and age greater than 75 years. For the current study, all patients admitted to the SBIS at CRGH campus over a ten-year period (January 2008 to December 2017) for treatment of an acute thermal burn injury with the intention to treat being survival were identified through the SBIS database, then cross referenced with CRGH medical and SLP records. For inclusion in the study, patients must have had confirmed inhalation injury on laryngoscopy, had been assessed by the SLP service in accordance with the pre-existing blanket referral system, and have no prior medical record history of pre-existing burn injury, dysphagia, dysphonia, neurological or head and neck pathology. The study was conducted with full ethical clearance (CRGH Human Research and Ethics Committee: AU/1/7A68315)."", ""Procedure"": ""Information was obtained through a retrospective medical and SLP record review. For all eligible participants, information was collected from the time of initial injury and throughout the complete duration of inpatient treatment as well as outpatient care, until the time of dysphagia and dysphonia resolution or until swallowing and voice functioning had plateaued such that no further gains from treatment were anticipated. From the medical charts, key demographic and medical information was collected for all cases including age, gender, %TBSA burn, mechanism of burn, anatomical location of burn, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, days of mechanical ventilation and presence of tracheostomy.Specific information pertaining to dysphagia, dysphonia and its recovery were then compiled from medical and SLP records. As the SLP service is an integrated part of the SBIS at CRGH in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, patients are reviewed on a daily basis initially and subsequently as clinically indicated until premorbid level of swallow and voice functioning is achieved or plateaued such that further gains are not anticipated."", ""Assessment of Swallow Function"": ""As per the routine clinical procedures followed within this service swallowing function was assessed by a Clinical Swallowing Examination (CSE) within 24 h of admission for non-intubated patients or within 24 h post extubation if the patient were mechanically ventilated at the point of hospital admission. Following this initial CSE, regular reassessment occurred during the course of management until the patient was determined to have regained premorbid swallowing function. When required, patients within this burns service will be referred for a FEES assessment. FEES is conducted in preference to a videofluoroscopic assessment to minimise the need for transporting the patient to the VFSS suite and risk of infection. Factors currently limiting routine use of FEES assessment for patients within the burns unit are operational, created by staffing and equipment resource limitations.The CSE assessments were conducted by one of two SLPs working in the services with 19 and 8 years of experience in burn injury management, respectively. The CSE procedure involved review of medical status, visual inspection of the oro-musculature and assessment of cranial nerves, then trials of selected fluid and food textures as clinically appropriate. The hyolaryngeal complex was palpated during each swallow and where feasible (considering skin integrity, etc.) and concurrent cervical auscultation was used as supplemental information to help inform the final clinical decision regarding swallow integrity. Appropriate diet and fluid consistencies along with other compensatory and therapeutic manoeuvres were recommended with the aim to rehabilitate swallowing function, minimise aspiration risk as well as maximise nutritional input. Clinical outcomes of the assessment were reported using the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS). The FOIS [29] is a 7-point scale used to define dysphagia presence and severity, based on the degree of food and fluid modification as well as the need for enteral nutrition (1 = nothing by mouth; 3 = tube dependent with consistent intake of food and fluid; 7 = total oral diet with no restriction).Throughout the admission, ongoing SLP swallowing management was delivered in accordance with individual patient needs and consistent with the clinical guidelines of Speech Pathology Australia [30] . Clinical practice remained standard and did not alter for the duration of this study. Conclusion of dysphagia treatment was deemed final once the SLP determined the patient's swallowing function had either reached premorbid status, or had plateaued (i.e. minimal changes noted and further advancement unlikely).Several endpoints were computed to examine the recovery of swallowing function consistent with prior studies [14-18, 22, 23] . Days to initiate oral feeding (DIOF) was defined as the number of days between the time of hospital admission and commencing first oral intake. Days to resolution of dysphagia (DROD) was calculated as the number of days between hospital admission, resolution of premorbid swallowing function and resumption of premorbid oral diet and fluids without the aid of compensatory and/or therapeutic manoeuvres. Enteral feeding is a necessity in most patients with large burn injury due to the extremely high metabolic demands that ensue to combat catabolism and facilitate wound healing, hence it is not a surrogate marker of dysphagia in this clinical population. Days of enteral feeding (DOEF) was expressed as the number of days that enteral feeding was in place regardless of swallowing diagnosis or management.Clinical outcomes data from the initial and discharge CSE were used to create a severity rating for dysphagia as per Rumbach et al. [14] where Mild Dysphagia was defined as requiring one level of restriction in either the food or fluid category (e.g. thin fluids and a soft dental diet) with the patient able to safely consume the majority of the modified meal; Moderate Dysphagia was defined as requiring one or more levels of restriction to both food and fluid consistencies to minimise aspiration risk (e.g. Mildly thick fluids and pureed solids) and the patient able to safely consume at least half of modified texture meal and Severe Dysphagia was defined as a high aspiration risk for all food and fluid consistencies with the patient being placed Nil By Mouth, with or without small trials of modified food or fluids only."", ""Assessment of Laryngeal Pathology and Vocal Function"": ""Laryngeal/pharyngeal injury was documented using laryngoscopy, conducted routinely at clinically appropriate time points as determined by the managing SLP and/or ENT Surgeon until at least 6 months post injury, unless resolution of laryngeal pathology occurred earlier. Reports from each laryngoscopy were reviewed for salient features with presence of anatomical and physiological pathology noted. From the regular SLP assessments, the presence of dysphonia was routinely examined using perceptual assessment by the managing SLP and reported as a dichotomous rating (present/absent) throughout the complete duration of inpatient admission as well as outpatient treatment until at least 6 months post injury. Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) was not routinely implemented at the time of laryngoscopy. This was due to either the acuity of the patient condition at the time of the procedure (e.g. laryngoscopy conducted in the emergency department for the primary reason of assessing airway patency and indication for intubation) or timing of procedure not permitting presence of a SLP to conduct FEES."", ""Statistical Analyses"": ""All data were entered into an Excel database, then descriptive and inferential statistics were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 24.0. Data analysis took part in two stages. Initial analysis involved descriptive analysis of the present study's inhalation cohort (Inhal_1, n = 38). Then any differences in the data between those patients with and without dysphagia within the inhalation injury cohort were examined.In the second stage analysis, data from the current study's cohort were directly compared to previously published outcomes data from Rumbach et al. [14] . Access to the original data set for their 438 participants was provided with institutional ethical approval and consent by the study authors. The original data set was subdivided into two population subgroups for the current research: (a) those with inhalation injury (Inhal_2, n = 30) and (b) a non-inhalation injury subset (Non-Inhal, n = 408). Comparisons (Chi-square and t tests) were conducted between the current and published inhalation cohorts, and between the current inhalation cohort and the published cohort with no inhalation injury. Significance was set at p < 0.05."", ""Inhalation Cohort"": ""Over the study period, 144 patients were admitted post thermal burn injury with suspected inhalation component, to the New South Wales SBIS CRGH Campus. Inhalation injury was confirmed on laryngoscopy in 38 participants (26 male; 12 female; mean age 40.82 years, range 17-71, SD 14.30) who formed the study cohort. The percent total body surface area (TBSA) ranged from 1-90% (mean 35.28, SD 23.55) with 100% exhibiting head and neck burns. Mechanical ventilation was required in 97% with a mean duration of 9.62 days ventilation (range 0-24 days, SD 6.36) and 18% required a tracheostomy. Hospital LOS ranged considerably from two and up to 213 days, with a mean of 60.2 days. On initial laryngoscopy (within 24 h of hospital admission), all participants exhibited evidence thermal injury to the pharyngeal and/or laryngeal mucosa. Laryngoscopy within one week of extubation or insertion of tracheostomy revealed persistent sloughy mucosal tissue in 8%, significant oedema and erythema in 37%, granulation or ulceration in 45% and restricted laryngeal movement in 45%. Six months post injury, persistent laryngeal pathology was apparent on laryngoscopy in 47.37% of participants. This pathology specifically involved the presence of scar tissue with resultant contracture in varying degrees at the level of the true vocal cords, false vocal cords, aryepiglottic folds, and anterior and posterior glottis which restricted laryngeal function. In two cases, airway patency was also compromised to the degree that tracheostomy and laser cordotomy were necessary. All participants (100%) exhibited dysphonia on clinical examination ( Table 1) .Incidence of dysphagia was 89.47% in the cohort with inhalation injury. Mean DIOF was 24.69 days (range 1-200 days, SD 42.87). DROD was an average of 29.79 days (range 1-222 days, SD 41.18), whilst mean DOEF was 45.03 days (range 0-200 days, SD 52.80). Dysphagia severity at the point of initial swallow assessment was severe in 78.9% of participants, moderate in 7.9%, and mild in 2.6% with 10.5% exhibiting no clinical dysphagia at all. At the point of discharge from the acute care facility, 97.4% had completely recovered their swallow function to premorbid ability, whilst 2.6% continued to exhibit severe dysphagia with complete dependence on enteral nutrition. Analysis of all cases included in this study revealed a low incidence of instrumental assessments being conducted, with only 7 (18.4%) participants undergoing a FEES procedure at some point during their admission. However, unfortunately as the timing of when this assessment occurred for each patient, and due to the low numbers of studies conducted, these data were not analysed or included in the current paper as it was deemed insufficient to make any conclusions or patterns regarding dysphagia presentation or recovery.Comparison of participants in the inhalation cohort who were identified either with (n = 34) and without (n = 4) dysphagia is also reported in Table 1 . Due to small and uneven group numbers, statistical comparisons were not conducted. However, patterns reveal those with dysphagia took longer to commence oral intake (mean 27.0 vs 6.5 days), longer to achieve premorbid swallowing function (mean 47.2 vs 10.3 days) and had a greater duration of enteral feeding (mean 49.6 vs 10 days), compared to their non-dysphagic counterparts. Further to this, patients with dysphagia had Table 1 Description of the total inhalation cohort, including sub-analysis of those with/ without dysphagia TBSA total body surface area, DIOF days to initiate oral feeding, DOEF days of enteral feeding, DROD days to resolution of dysphagia, ETT endotracheal tube, ICU intensive care unit, LOS length of stay compared to those without dysphagia. Whilst it is well documented that intubation duration is associated with presence and severity of dysphagia, the results above suggest that there are additional factors beyond intubation duration that are associated with risk for dysphagia in the inhalation burn population. This will be further explored within the discussion section of the manuscript below."", ""Comparison to Published Inhalation Cohort Data"": ""Comparing the current study's inhalation cohort (Inhal_1; n = 38) to the 2012 published inhalation cohort (Inhal_2; n = 30) of Rumbach and colleagues [14] , all participants presented with burn injury to the head and neck region, with both cohorts comparable for age (p = 0.917) and size of burn injury (p = 0.394). Similarly, a high proportion of patients received mechanical ventilation (97.8% vs 90%) with a comparable duration of intubation (p = 0.743). Further to this, the rate of tracheostomy insertion lacked significant variability at 18.4% and 20%, respectively (p = 0.8686). Both hospital LOS as well as ICU LOS were again similar (p = 0.62; p = 0.872) across the two groups. Importantly, the incidence of dysphagia in the current study (Inhal_1; 89.5% dysphagic) was comparable (p = 0.7267) to the rate described by Rumbach et al. [14] (Inhal_2; 86.7% dysphagic). Further to this, DIOF (p = 0.084) and DROD (p = 0.996) were also similar across the two cohorts. There was, however, a significant difference (p = 0.007) in DOEF between the two inhalation groups, with participants in the current study requiring a greater period of enteral feeding by approximately 13 days. These data are summarised in Table 2 .Interestingly, dysphagia severity was significantly higher in the Inhal_1 cohort (78.9% severe dysphagia) compared to the Inhal_2 cohort (43.3% severe dysphagia) at the point of initial assessment (p = 0.0027); however, resolution was "", ""Comparison to Published Non-inhalation Cohort Data"": ""Comparisons between the inhalation cohort (Inhal_1; n = 38) and the published non-inhalation cohort (Non-Inhal; n = 408) of Rumbach et al. [14] , revealed that age was comparable across the two groups. However, the proportion of head and neck burns (100% Inhal_1 vs 26.2% Non-Inhal; p < 0.0001) and rate of tracheostomy insertion (18.42% Inhal_1 vs 0.49%; Non-Inhal; p < 0.0001) were both significantly greater for those with inhalation injury. Furthermore, the inhalation cohort had a higher percentage TBSA burn (p = 0.000), longer duration of endotracheal intubation (p = 0.000), as well as greater hospital (p = 0.000) and ICU LOS (p = 0.000) than their non-inhalation injury counterparts.Incidence of dysphagia was significantly greater (p < 0.0001) in participants with inhalation injury (Inhal_1; 89.47% dysphagic) compared to those without (Non-Inhal; 5.6% dysphagic). In addition, DIOF was significantly greater (p < 0.0001) in the current inhalation cohort (Inhal_1; mean DIOF = 24.69 days) compared to those without inhalation injury (Non-Inhal; mean DIOF = 0.089 days). Similarly, DROD was significantly elevated (p < 0.0001) in those with inhalation injury (Inhal_1; mean DROD = 29.79 days) compared to those without (Non-Inhal; mean DROD = 1.67 days). Lastly, DOEF was also significantly longer (p < 0.0001) in those with inhalation injury (Inhal_1; mean DOEF = 45.03 days) versus those without inhalation injury (Non-Inhal; mean DOEF = 1.96 days).Dysphagia severity was predictably greater (p < 0.0001) at initial assessment for the inhalation injury cohort in the present study (Inhal_1; 78.9% severe dysphagia) compared to those without inhalation injury (Non-Inhal; 1.7% severe dysphagia) (Fig. 2) ; however, by the time of hospital discharge, the proportion of those with functional swallowing were analogous (p = 0.226) (Fig. 3 )."", ""Discussion"": ""This study demonstrates that within our cohort of 38 participants, the presence of dysphagia is 16 times higher in patients with burn injury and a concomitant inhalation injury than those with no inhalation injury in the study of Rumbach et al. [14] . Further to this, laryngeal pathology due to inhalation injury is associated with an increase in dysphagia severity, with dysphagia recovery considerably protracted compared to their non-inhalation injury counterparts. The present data highlight that the SLP services need to be actively involved in the early and ongoing management of patients with inhalation injury in order to proactively support dysphagia risk and enhance swallow safety and recovery.There are a number of potential precipitating factors behind the mechanism of dysphagia in this population. Firstly, a majority of patients (97.37%) in the current study received intubation and mechanical ventilation with mean duration of 9.37 days, as part of their treatment. Rumbach and colleagues [13] have previously identified that the presence of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation hold positive predictive value at 56.82% and 59.92%, respectively, for the development of dysphagia. Further to this, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation is well recognised in the literature to be associated with dysphagia [31] with current incidence rates of dysphagia post extubation documented up to 62% [32] . Mechanisms for dysphagia in the intubated population have been proposed to be related to both the underlying medical diagnosis as well as the period of oropharyngeal muscle disuse and associated atrophy [33, 34] . Furthermore, the potential physiological and anatomical damage as a result of the endotracheal tube itself cannot be dismissed. The presence of muscle atrophy and localised endotracheal tube trauma is acknowledged to be probable in the present study population. However, given the rate of dysphagia following inhalation injury exceeds documented rates of dysphagia following endotracheal intubation, this suggests that there are additional processes that are impacting swallow integrity in this cohort.A second causative factor for dysphagia in those patients with inhalation injury is the effect of the burn injury itself on oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal mucosa sensory and motor function. Histologically, whilst mucosa of the tongue blade, hard and soft palate appear to be resistant to the development of scar tissue and contractures following thermal inhalation or ingestion burn injury, the floor of mouth, pharyngeal and especially laryngeal mucosa are not [35] . As such, injury to these anatomical sites are associated with elevated risk for the development of scar tissue and contractures with subsequent impact upon motor and sensory function [36] . This may be postulated to represent as a reduction of airway protection during swallowing in addition to a reduction in airway responsiveness should an aspiration event occur. This is supported by the work of Clayton et al. [16, 24, 37] and Rumbach et al. [14, [18] [19] [20] 27] who have previously highlighted that oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal sensory deficits are common features of the burn injured patient with dysphagia.Thirdly, the presence of acute deconditioning beyond the degree that is caused by presence of the endotracheal tube and associated oropharyngeal muscle disuse should not be underappreciated. Severe burn injury frequently induces a hypermetabolic state in burn sizes above 20 percent of the total body surface area, which can subsequently result in loss of muscle mass [28] . In the current study, the mean burn size of participants was 35.28%, thus indicating that a substantial portion of participants in this cohort had a burn size that would result in catabolism, strongly inferring that they may be at risk for acute deconditioning including oropharyngeal muscle atrophy with its resultant effects on swallow physiology. This is also supported by previous work examining the profile of dysphagia following severe burn injury [14, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] 27] , which documents that the primary characteristics of dysphagia following thermal burn injury include oral and pharyngeal phase deficits with the presence of reduced base of tongue retraction as well as impaired pharyngeal constriction that manifests as pharyngeal retention and elevated aspiration risk.The extraordinarily high rate as well as greater severity of dysphagia in the present study highlights that early and rigorous dysphagia rehabilitation is paramount. Prevention and minimisation of the effects of deconditioning as well as contractures on swallow function is necessary to optimise functional swallowing outcomes. Evidence is emerging within the literature support this concept [16, [18] [19] [20] ; however, further work is required to more clearly define optimal treatment methods to expedite safe transition to oral intake in this challenging population.It is also important to consider that laryngeal pathology as a result of inhalation injury may not only adversely affect swallow function in the short term during the patient's immediate treatment post burn injury, but it may also compromise patient function later in life as a causative factor for the reduction of physiological reserve. Whilst the majority of patients who are cognitively and neurologically intact will learn to adapt to changes in laryngeal anatomy and physiology as it relates to swallowing, should an event occur to compromise that cognitive and neurological level of function, it is plausible to hypothesise that their ability to continue to adapt and compensate following an insult may be compromised.One aspect that was not comparable between the two inhalation cohorts was the duration of enteral feeding. There are two possible explanations for this. Firstly, it is plausible that one cohort may have had issues with wound healing or increased nutritional needs for any one of a number of facets of burn rehabilitation, necessitating increased duration of supplementary nutrition. Secondly, given that these two cohorts were from two independent burn units, it is equally possible that habitual practices of each respective burn unit dietitian may vary slightly. As no specific nutritional parameters were recorded as a primary endpoint in this study, this aspect cannot be controlled for. The severity of dysphagia at the initial assessment of the 2 inhalation cohorts was also found to differ. As there was no significant difference in severity or injury presentation between the two cohorts, the reasons for this difference cannot be explained by the current data available."", ""Limitations"": ""The current study is limited by the retrospective nature of the data collection, and as such, it is acknowledged that the data available was limited to those assessments conducted as part of routine clinical care. A prospective study of burn patients that includes set time points at which patients could complete a full battery of outcome measures pertaining to swallowing would be beneficial to fully appreciate the specifics regarding patterns of dysphagia recovery and presence of long-term laryngotracheal dysfunction. The small sample size is also a potential issue due to the known high level of heterogeneity in the clinical burn population. As this was a single Statewide service study, the need to involve multi-site data sets from other Statewide services to produce a more robust sample is recognised. However, given that characteristics of the current inhalation cohort did not differ significantly on most parameters from those with inhalation injury reported by Rumbach et al. [14] , which was set in a separate Statewide service within the same country, the authors believe that patterns reported here are potentially true indications of the nature of recovery post inhalation burn injury.There are also known issues with diagnosing patients with inhalation injury. The diagnosis itself of inhalational injury is often based on history and clinical suspicion [38] . In this study, however, a minimum of visual inspection via laryngoscopy was required to determine presence of inhalation injury. Despite this, it is accepted that this diagnostic process is subject to inter-observer variability and clinical experience. Various other modalities are also available to confirm the diagnosis, such as bronchoscopy, however, there are currently no agreed standard criteria for establishing the severity of this diagnosis.Finally, there are multiple issues acknowledged regarding basing the diagnosis of dysphagia on a CSE alone. The authors fully acknowledge that a CSE does not provide the diagnostic information as available from instrumental assessments such as FEES or videofluoroscopy. Recognising the issues associated with a CSE, it is accepted that sub-clinical symptoms of dysphagia may have been missed, or severity of dysphagia not fully appreciated. As such the data presented within this study may be in fact an under-representation of the true incidence and severity of dysphagia. Future prospective studies incorporating regular instrumental assessment are needed to fully understand the influence of damage to the pharyngeal and laryngeal structures on swallow function. The authors also accept that there is debate regarding the added benefit of including cervical auscultation in the CSE and its value in informing on swallow integrity [39] . Auscultation was simply used in this study as an adjunct measure to add to the clinical information being collected on each patient and its limitations are acknowledged. The FOIS scale also has known limitations when applied in this population due to the long-term dependence of many patients on non-oral feeding for reasons other than dysphagia. However, the absence of population specific/sensitive tools limits choice of outcome measures at present."", ""Conclusion"": ""The incidence of dysphagia in patients with inhalation injury is extremely high: 16 times greater than in those with burn injury but without an inhalation component in the present study. Laryngeal pathology due to inhalation injury increases not only dysphagia severity but also the duration to dysphagia recovery.""}","Influence of Inhalation Injury on Incidence, Clinical Profile and Recovery Pattern of Dysphagia Following Burn Injury","Inhalation injury is predictive of dysphagia post burns; however, the nature of dysphagia associated with inhalation burns is not well understood. This study describes the clinical profile and recovery pattern of swallowing following inhalation burn injury.

Initial dysphagia presentation and dysphagia recovery pattern were documented using the FOIS. Co-presence of dysphonia was determined clinically and rated present/absent. Persistent laryngeal/pharyngeal injury at 6 months was documented using laryngoscopy. Data were compared to published data from a large adult burn cohort.

Most emerging infectious disease pathogens in humans cross from their natural zoonotic reservoir to human populations where early mutated, reassorted or recombined forms begin to spread from person-toperson [Antia et al. (2003) ]. Examples include human immunodeficiency virus, monkey pox, severe acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic influenza. Currently, a highly pathogenic avian influenza strain (H5N1) has been spreading from poultry to humans, mostly in Southeast Asia, with possible limited human-to-human spread through close contact in Indonesia [Butler (2006) ]. A concern is that this virus could cause a large scale pandemic as it becomes more adapted to human-to-human transmission. Realtime surveillance provides limited information on small clusters of human cases in terms of symptom onset times and physical location. It is critical to answer two questions in real time: 1. Is the infectious agent spreading from person to person? and 2. If it is, how transmissible is it? The first question is novel and, to our knowledge, has not been addressed in the statistical literature. The second question is an estimation problem, and various statistical methods using household data are applicable, such as the models based on observed final infection status [Longini and Koopman (1982) , Becker and Hasofer (1997) , O'Neill and Roberts (1999) ] and those based on a discretetime sequence of symptom onset [Rampey et al. (1992) , Yang, Longini and Halloran (2006) ]. Our major goal in this paper is to answer the first question, but an estimation method is needed for this goal. We base our approach on that in Yang, Longini and Halloran (2006) .The statistical questions hinge on inference about the transmissibility of the infectious agent. The basic reproductive number, R 0 , is the fundamental measure of the transmissibility of an emerging infectious agent. Given that the emerging infectious agent is transmissible, estimates of R 0 will generally be small and are not very informative. In addition, estimation of some epidemic characteristics such as secondary attack rates (SAR) and R 0 heavily relies on the specification of a correct transmission model. When there is no person-to-person transmission, estimates of these characteristics may be nonzero, but are not meaningful. Therefore, a test of the existence of personto-person transmission can provide a solid ground for parameter estimation. Specifically, one would like to test whether the person-to-person transmission probability, no matter how it is defined, is 0. As a probability always takes values from 0 to 1, the boundary value 0, which is a nonstandard condition, imposes an immediate challenge, because the null distribution of standard statistics, based on which tests are performed, are generally difficult to track. Although statisticians have discussed asymptotic tests for a limited set of scenarios [Moran (1971) , Self and Liang (1987) , Feng and McCulloch (1992) ], more often such an asymptotic null distribution is not available for a specific case. Furthermore, the validity of asymptotic tests depends on relatively large sample sizes, which may compromise the power of such tests to detect person-to-person transmission if applied to a small sample size, such as those generated by avian influenza. These challenges motivate our investigation in exact rather than asymptotic testing methods.2. Methods. The data structure we usually observe is a sequence of symptom onsets and associated cluster information, for example, at what time a symptom onset occurred in which household. To construct a probability model with a reasonable level of complexity from the observed data, it is necessary to make basic assumptions about the natural history of the disease and the transmission mechanism. We assume that the incubation period is the same as the latent period, but other assumptions could be made about the relation of the two periods. We make the following additional assumptions about the disease. Any newly infected person remains asymptomatic over a period of \u03b4 days (the incubation period) before symptom onset, where \u03b4 is a random quantity with a distribution of g(l) = Pr(\u03b4 = 1), l = \u03b4 min , \u03b4 min + 1, . . . , \u03b4 max . We denote by \u03b4 min and \u03b4 max the minimum and maximum durations (in days) of the latent period. Upon symptom onset, the person becomes and remains infectious over a period of \u03b7 days (infectious period), where \u03b7 is also a random quantity with a distribution f (l) = Pr(\u03b7 = l), l = \u03b7 min , \u03b7 min + 1, . . . , \u03b7 max . Similarly, \u03b7 min and \u03b7 max are the minimum and maximum durations of the infectious period. In this paper our method requires pre-specifying g(l) and f (l).We consider the dynamic of a community-based epidemic on a day-byday basis. We assume that the whole community is exposed to some external source with a constant level of infectivity for S days. Such an external common source takes into account all possible channels, such as exposure to infected animals, through which the disease can be introduced into the community. Let b be the probability that a susceptible person in the community is infected by the common source during one day of exposure. The probability of infection by the common source throughout the S-day exposure period is called the community probability of infection (CPI) and is given by [Longini and Koopman (1982) ]. Once the disease is introduced into the community, transmission between people may occur through contacts. There are various types of contacts one can define. We define a contact as all possible interactions during one day that can potentially transmit the disease from an infective person to a susceptible person. We consider two levels of contacts: close contacts between two persons who live in the same household and casual contacts between two persons who live in different households but may make contact in the community. We denote by p 1 the daily probability of transmission with a close contact, and by p 2 with a casual contact.With the above setting, we can construct a likelihood and obtain the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) for the unknown parameters (b, p 1 and p 2 ) as given in the Appendix. Two quantities related to transmission probabilities that we would also like to estimate are the SAR and R 0 . The SAR is defined as the probability of infection if a susceptible is exposed to an infective during his or her infectious period. Corresponding to the levels of contact, there are two types of SAR defined as SAR k = l f (l)(1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p k ) l ), k = 1, 2. SAR 1 is the SAR within households and is of more epidemiological interest than SAR 2 . The basic reproductive number refers to the expected number of people a typical infective person can infect among a large susceptible population. Here we are interested in the expected number of people that an infective person can infect given that he or she is the first infected person in this community. We refer to this as the local reproductive number R. Estimates of the local R cannot be generalized to a broader context because of the potential selection bias. The clusters are often selected based on a number of cases and may represent higher R 0 than in the general population. For a community of N households with a uniform household sizeNonzero estimates of p 1 or p 2 do not necessarily imply that their true values are nonzero. In addition, construction of valid 95% confidence intervals for the estimates of transmission probabilities is difficult when their true values are 0's. Therefore, a valid test of the hypothesis p 1 = p 2 = 0 would be of great public health interest. A formal statement of the hypothesis test iswhere H 0 is the null hypothesis and H 1 is the alternative hypothesis.A natural choice of test statistic is the likelihood ratio statisticwhere the numerator is the maximum likelihood (ML) when we restrict p 1 = p 2 = 0, and the denominator is the ML without such restriction, both conditioning on observed symptom onset timest i (t i = \u221e for uninfected individuals). Explicit expression of the likelihoods are given in the Appendix. The likelihood ratio statistic asymptotically follows a Chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom when H 0 is true, if all regularity conditions hold for this probability structure [Lehmann (1999) ]. However, two nonstandard conditions are present in our case. One is that the hypothesized parameter values under testing are boundary. As mentioned before, the asymptotic null distribution is generally difficult to track when boundary values are to be tested. Self and Liang (1987) discussed asymptotic distributions of the likelihood ratio statistic for some settings of boundary parameters, but our case is not one of them. The other nonstandard condition is that the parameters to be tested affect the domain of observable data. When p 1 = p 2 = 0, infections are confined to the S days with exposure to the common infective source. Therefore, no symptom onset can happen after day S + \u03b4 max . When p 1 = 0 or p 2 = 0, the domain of the observable data is much larger. No valid asymptotic test exists when this nonstandard condition is present, unless we only use the data up to day S for testing at the price of losing some information.Resampling methods have been widely applied to hypothesis testing, especially in the recent decade because of their easy implementation with modern computational capacity. While employing less stringent model assumptions, these methods can attain the same level of statistical power as standard tests [Hoeffding (1952) , Box and Andersen (1955) ]. Permutation tests (or randomization tests) have been well developed in the setting of two-sample comparison and ANOVA [Fisher (1935) , Pitman (1937) , Welch (1990) ]. For the boundary problem with parameter values specified by H 0 , the bootstrap was used in combination with the likelihood ratio statistic to test the number of components in mixture models [McLachlan (1987) , Feng and McCulloch (1996) ]. We propose two approaches, a simple permutation test and a more refined one, for the problem of testing the person-to-person transmission probability. These resampling-based methods do not suffer from the two nonstandard conditions mentioned above, as shown by a simulation study. When the observed data are truly generated from H 0 , we can reassign all of the observed symptom onset days (and associated infection status) to a different collection of individuals, and every such rearrangement is equally likely with the same likelihood L 0 . The empirical distribution of the test statistic calculated from permuting symptom onset days across the population can then be used to approximate the null distribution under H 0 . This simple permutation test can be refined by varying symptom onset days of infected individuals in any given permuted data while keeping the likelihood L 0 under the null hypothesis unchanged. The refined permutation test resamples data points from a much larger sampling space as compared to the simple permutation test. Technical details concerning development of the two resampling methods can be found in the Appendix.We first use simulations to verify the validity of the resampling methods by comparing them to the asymptotic test for a simpler scenario with only b and p 1 , that is, person-to-person transmission can only happen within households. For this two-parameter setting, Self and Liang (1987) showed that \u03bb will asymptotically follow a mixture distribution of \u03c7 2 0 and \u03c7 2 1 with equal mixing probability. Only data up to day S are used for such comparison with the asymptotic test. We found that the refined permutation test has the best performance in terms of preserving type I error at the pre-specified level and yielding higher statistical power when population size and the number of cases are small. Results and discussion for the simple scenario are provided in the Appendix as well. Then we use simulations to investigate the performance of the refined permutation test for the scenario with three parameters: b, p 1 and p 2 .Computing \u03bb involves calculating likelihoods under two different models, the one with restriction of parameters conforming to H 0 is the null model, and the other one without any restriction is the full model. For a realized epidemic, one of the two models may not be admissible (or possible). For example, when the minimum interval between any pair of consecutive cases is larger than the maximum duration of the latent period, no infection can be possibly attributed to person-to-person infection; thus, only the null model is admissible. On the other hand, when there is any case on or after the day S + \u03b4 max , where \u03b4 max is the maximum duration of the latent period, only the full model is admissible because the common source is infective up to day S. When only the null (full) model is admissible, the p-value for that epidemic is assigned 1 (0). Resampling-based tests are performed only when both models are admissible. Checking admissibility can help avoid nonconvergence problems when maximizing likelihoods.3. Results. For simplicity, we simulate epidemics over a community composed of 100 households, each of size 5. We let the exposure to external common source last S = 30 days, and let the epidemic exhaust itself. We do not introduce initial cases to start the epidemic, but let the common source initiate infection. Simulation runs with zero infections were discarded. We simulate epidemics based on g(l) = 1 3 , l = 1, 2, 3, and f (l) = 1 3 , l = 3, 4, 5, and these distribution are correctly specified by the methods that we evaluate. All p-values presented in this section are obtained by the refined permutation test, but simulations show that the simple permutation method gives similar results under the same population and parameter settings as discussed here, except that it tends to be too conservative about preserving type I error for extremely small b. As p 2 is of limited interest, we fix it at 0.00005 (SAR 2 = 0.0002), and vary b from 0.0002 to 0.002 (CPI from 0.006 to 0.058) with a step of 0.0002. We vary p 1 from 0.004 to 0.046 (SAR 1 from 0.016 to 0.17) with steps chosen specific to b so as to yield power values in the range of (0.6, 1.0). All tests are performed at the level of 0.05, that is, we intend to have type I errors of no more than 5% when p 1 = p 2 = 0. An epidemic curve of a sample run for b = 0.001 (CPI = 0.03) and p 1 = 0.014 (SAR 1 = 0.055) is displayed in Figure 1 , with each block representing a symptomatic case. Cases from the same household are filled with the same color. A pattern is evident that cases in the same household tend to cluster together in time. The CPI, R and SAR given in the figure are based on the true parameters, but they could be estimated from the data as well. Results based on 2000 simulations and 2000 permutations for each test are presented in Table 1 . The first row where p 1 = p 2 = 0 gives type I errors for various values of b, from which it is observed that type I errors are all preserved at the specified level. As expected, larger p 1 yields higher power for fixed b; similarly, larger b also yields higher power for any given p 1 . Surprisingly, when there are as few as a total of only seven cases, it is still possible to have 80% power with a moderate p 1 (SAR 1 = 0.14), which means that person-to-person transmission can still be detected even when there is a very limited number of cases. This finding could be very useful as most avian influenza epidemics in humans in recent years have a scale of eight total cases or fewer. Of interest as well is that all of the R values are below 1, as seen from the last column of Table 1 . Figure 2 illustrates the information in Table 1 , where power levels are shown in different colors and symbols with b and p 1 as the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. The 80% power contour curve obtained by Loess smoothing lies between green circles and red downward triangles. This figure clearly displays the trend of such a contour curve, descending sharply at b = 0.0002 (CPI = 0.006) and becoming flat around p 1 = 0.008 (SAR 1 = 0.032) as b increases to 0.0014 (CPI = 0.041). Let N idx denote the mean number of index cases and N tot the mean total number of cases, averaging over all simulated epidemics. As only the number of cases are observable in real epidemics, we replace b and p 1 with N idx and N tot as the axes in Figure 3 . Not surprisingly, the underlying 80% power contour curve looks more linear, since roughly N tot \u2248 (1 + R)N idx . While R depends on p 1 , the range of 1 + R is relatively narrow, about [1.2, 1.3] at b \u2265 0.0006, and becomes narrower as b increases. The figure also indicates that the power to detect person-to-person transmission is jointly determined by N idx and N tot , instead of either alone. We fitted a linear regression between the complementary log-log transformed power values and selected transformations of N idx and N tot , and found the following empirical formula:which explains 99% of the variation in power. Figure 4 plots the simulated vs. fitted power values, where most points fall close to the diagonal line, indicating that the empirical formula gives decent prediction, except for one point at b = 0.0002 and p 1 = 0.03, where the predicted power, 0.71, is somewhat lower than the simulated power, 0.75. Such an empirical formula could be used to predict power levels at various values of N tot and N idx for which simulations are not performed. The coefficients in the empirical formula will likely change for different parameter settings, and the linearity may not always hold. To investigate how sensitive the statistical power of the permutation test is to the distribution of the latent period, we vary the true mean duration from 1.5 to 14 days, while keeping g(l) a uniform distribution over three days. These distributions of the latent period are correctly specified in the models. We expect to see an increase in power, because increasing the latent period is essentially increasing the generation time between successive cases [Fine (2003) ]. To look at the trend of changes in power when b is small, medium and large, simulations were done under three parameter settings: . The values of p 1 are chosen to ensure that the initial power is below 0.8 and has the potential of reaching or exceeding 0.8. Results are displayed in Figure 5 . Overall, power increases, and the rate of increment decreases, as the mean duration of the latent period (and thus the generation time) becomes longer. However, the rate of increment is higher at larger values of b, which means that the power of the refined permutation test is more sensitive to the distribution of the latent period when b is large. Such sensitivity does not compromise the usefulness of the permutation test, since our simulation study is performed under the setting with the minimum level of power. For avian influenza, the mean latent period may be as long as 14 days, and the power will very likely be higher than in our simulation setting.4. Discussion. We have proposed a simple permutation method and its refined version to test the presence of person-to-person transmission within or between households. Using simulations, we have shown that the resampling methods are comparable to or outcompete the standard asymptotic testing method where such asymptotic method is applicable. More importantly, the resampling methods remain valid in many settings where the asymptotic method is not applicable or not available yet. We have shown that, for an infectious disease with relatively rare incidence, person-to-person transmission could still be detected with decent power even if the total number of cases is as few as seven or eight, given that the transmission probability is high and the population is relatively large. We have studied the statistical power of the resampling methods under the model with two levels of contacts: within households and between households. The methods could be generalized to models with additional clustering groups such as schools and work places.We have assumed that the latent and incubation periods are identical and that the distributions of the latent and infectious periods are known. Other assumptions about the relation between the latent and incubation periods could be made, but may lead to different inference procedures and conclusions. As the presence of the infectious period implies nonzero transmission probabilities, the actual alternative hypothesis we are testing is p 1 > 0 or p 2 > 0 and \u03b7 \u223c f (l), that is, f (l) is a part of the parameters, but we fix it rather than estimate it. Estimating g(l) and f (l) solely from a sequence of symptom onsets is an ongoing research topic and is only practical for a relatively large number of cases [Wallinga (2004) , Cauchemez (2006) ]. To use our method in real epidemics, one could choose a range of plausible settings of g(l) and f (l), and any setting yielding a significant p-value is a warning sign of transmission between human beings. Appropriate adjustment for multiple testing could be used, but one should be aware that these tests are highly correlated as they are essentially based on the same data set, and a Bonferroni-type adjustment is likely to be over-conservative.In our simulation study the likelihood is calculated up to day T \u2212 \u03b4 max for subjects who do not show symptoms up to day T , an incomplete adjustment for right-censoring of infection status. A complete adjustment should take into account that infection might have occurred after T \u2212 \u03b4 max and the latent period extends over T . Complete adjustments may be important for realtime analysis, especially when T \u226b \u03b4 max does not hold. In our simulation setting, T \u226b \u03b4 max approximately holds, and the bias in parameter estimates induced by right-censoring is minimal according to the simulation results in Yang, Longini and Halloran (2006) .When conducting the test, maximum likelihood estimates of b, p 1 and p 2 are obtained. From these, estimates of other quantities such as the local reproductive number R and SAR can be derived. We note that, fixed at a value as small as 0.00005 (SAR 2 = 0.0002), p 2 is generally underestimated due to limited information and, consequently, R is also biased downward. Based on simulation results (not shown), the bias decreases as the true value of p 2 or size of the data increases.We have assumed that each susceptible individual is exposed to an external common infectious source up to day S. One may argue that such exposure may only be reasonable for a subset of the population in some situations. Our model can be applied to such situations as well, but only when there is no infected case in the subpopulation which is not exposed to the common source; otherwise, person-to-person transmission exists for sure. In addition, the exposure level to the common source can be assumed as varying from household to household, but permutation should be restricted within households and inference must be supported with sufficient data.In real epidemics, statistical inference may be very sensitive to the specification of S. Particularly, mis-specifying a smaller value for S will likely increase the type I error, as cases that appear after S + \u03b4 max must be accounted for by intensive person-to-person transmission. If no relevant information is available for determining S, assuming S \u2265 T will yield the most conservative p-value. Changing the value of S may affect the admissibility of models, depending on the specification of g(l) and f (l). To apply our methods, it is necessary to ensure that both the null and the alternative models are admissible under these assumptions. Additionally, it may be difficult to identify a clear cut point for the common source exposure, and how to impose the censoring mechanism on S without compromising the test performance is open to further research.Early detection of person-to-person transmission from limited data is crucial in containing pandemics of emerging infectious diseases such as avian influenza, and our work provides an effective tool for such evaluation. Our method requires not only a time sequence of symptom onsets, but also data on membership of households, whether or not they have cases. We believe that such data requirements are reasonable, and that the information could be collected by local health authorities. When only households with cases are available, selection bias needs to be addressed to make the test valid, which is a topic for further investigation. APPENDIX A.1. Statistical model. Assume that the epidemic starts on day 1 and stops by day T in a population of size N . Lett i be the symptom onset day for an infected person i. The probability that an infective family member j infects subject i on day t, given that subject i is not infected up through day t \u2212 1, is expressed aswhere I(\u00b7) is the indicator function (1: true, 0: false), H i is the set of people in the same household with person i, and f (l) is the distribution of the infectious period. The probability that subject i escapes infection from all infective sources on day t, conditioning on that subject i is not infected up through day t \u2212 1, is then given byBecause the exact infection date is unobservable, we assume that the duration of the latent period \u03b4 is distributed as g(l) = Pr(\u03b4 = l), l = \u03b4 min , \u03b4 min + 1, . . . , \u03b4 max , so that we can construct a likelihood for person i as the following:The overall likelihood L(b, p 1 , p 2 |t i , i = 1, . . . , N ) = i L i (b, p 1 , p 2 |t j , j = 1, . . . , N ) for the full model is maximized with respect to b, p 1 and p 2 to obtain the MLEs of the three parameters, and from these, the estimates of CPI, SARs and R. For notational convenience, we suppress the information about household membership that should appear behind the condition symbol in L. When there is no person-to-person transmission, that is, p 1 = p 2 = 0, (3) reduces toLet L 0 (b|t i , i = 1, . . . , N ) denote the likelihood for the null model. The test statistic is defined as in (1)."", ""A.2. Null distribution."": ""A.2.1. Resampling distribution. Consider the observed data set as a sample point from the space of all possible infection status and symptom onset times that could occur based on the given population and parameter setting. There exists a class of sample points, which we refer to as the likelihood equivalence class, that have the same likelihood L 0 (b|t i , i = 1, . . . , N ) as the observed data under the null hypothesis H 0 : p 1 = p 2 = 0. If the null hypothesis is true, each sample point in the class occurs with equal probability. That is, if such a class is identifiable, we can obtain the null distribution of the test statistic by resampling sample points from the class with equal probability. Clearly, sample points obtained by permuting the observed infection status and associated symptom onset dates across the population belong to the likelihood equivalence class. Generally, the whole likelihood equivalence class is difficult to identify, and the use of permuted samples is straightforward and fruitful. Let (t N ) be the kth permuted sample of (t 1 ,t 2 , . . . ,t N ), and let \u03bb [k] be the corresponding test statistic, k = 1, . . . , M . Then the empirical distribution of \u03bb [k] over all k can serve as the null distribution of \u03bb, and the p-value is given by 1 M k I(\u03bb \u2265 \u03bb [k] ). In our situation, however, it is possible to identify a subset of the likelihood equivalence class which is much larger than and that contains the permuted samples. The idea is more clearly illustrated in the situation without the latent period. Suppose that infection times are observable, and lett i denote the infection time instead of the symptom onset time for now. Then, the likelihood for the null model is given bywhere D is the set of\u00d1 infected subjects and D the set of uninfected subjects. Therefore, one can randomly re-arrange the infection status and infection times while keeping the likelihood value unchanged, as long as the sum of infection times ( i\u2208Dt i ) and the number of infections (\u00d1 ) remain the same. Each re-arrangement is a sample point in the likelihood equivalence class. To keep\u00d1 unchanged, a permutation of the infection and associated symptom status across the population would suffice, and we refer to it as the initial stage of the resampling procedure. The next stage, which we call the refinement stage, is to draw a sample point with equal probability from all possible distinct re-arrangements of infection times, given the infected cases are fixed. If the refinement stage is not carefully planned, the principle of equal probability can be easily violated, and the consequence is incorrect type I error and/or insufficient statistical power. The problem can be re-stated as sampling with equal probability from all distinct arrangements of n balls (sum of infection times) into m boxes (infected cases), each box with a fixed volume of v (S). Let W (n, m, v) be the number of all possible distinct arrangements for such condition. This is a recursive system that can be solved bywith the stopping rules W (n, 0, v) = 0, W (0, m, v) = 1 and W (n, 1, v) = I(n \u2264 v). An arrangement can be sampled with equal probability through the following procedure:1. Start with the box labeled i = 1, and there are N 1 = n balls to be distributed. 2. In step i, let N i be the number of balls not distributed yet. Randomly choose an integer n i from (0, 1, . . . , r) according to the weights W (N i \u2212 k, m \u2212 i, v), k = 0, 1, . . . , r, where r = min(N i , v), and assign n i balls to box i. Let N i+1 = N i \u2212 n i , and go to box i + 1. 3. In the last step, distribute all the remaining N m balls to box m. N m will not exceed v for sure, because in step m \u2212 1 any arrangement resulting in N m > v has a weight of 0 and thus is excluded from sampling. Hence, this sampling procedure has the advantage of looping over all boxes only once.This sampling scheme can be adapted to situations with a latent period, but symptom onset times instead of infection times are subject to re-arrangements. The main deviation from the above ideal situation is that, because some cases may have special exposure history, re-arrangement of their symptom onset times will likely change the whole likelihood, and thus, they should be excluded from the refinement stage. One example is seen in simulations, where we let the exposure to a common source of infection last from day 1 to day S, and let the latent period vary from \u03b4 min to \u03b4 max days. For any case i with symptom onset timet i > \u03b4 max , there are \u03b4 max \u2212 \u03b4 min + 1 days in which infection could happen, that is, any day betweent i \u2212 \u03b4 max andt i \u2212 \u03b4 min . Symptom onset time of case i could be re-arranged from day \u03b4 max + 1 to day S + \u03b4 min without changing the likelihood of the null model, as long as the sum of symptom onset times are not changed. However, there may be cases with symptom onset between day \u03b4 min + 1 and day \u03b4 max , for whom the number of days in which infection could happen is less than \u03b4 max \u2212 \u03b4 min + 1. Re-arrangement of symptom onset times of these cases will very likely change the likelihood because the number of potential infection days will also change. Similarly, cases with symptom onset after day S + \u03b4 min should be excluded from the refinement stage as well.A.2.2. Asymptotic distribution. While the asymptotic null distribution of \u03bb is not readily available for testing H 0 : p 1 = p 2 = 0, it is available for testing H 0 : p 1 = 0 if we fix p 2 = 0, that is, infection is only possible by the common source or within-household contacts. In this two-parameter setting, the escape probability for person i on day t given the existence of personto-person transmission isand the test statistic is \u03bb = \u22122 log sup b L 0 (b|t i , i = 1, . . . , N ) sup b,p 1 L(b, p 1 |t i , i = 1, . . . , N ) . (7) Self and Liang (1987) showed that \u03bb \u223c 1 2 \u03c7 2 0 + 1 2 \u03c7 2 1 under H 0 : p 1 = 0 in such a model, where \u03c7 2 0 is constant 0 and \u03c7 2 1 is a Chi-square random variable with one degree of freedom.A.3. Simulation study in the two-parameter setting. We compare the resampling test to the asymptotic test via a simulation study for the twoparameter setting. Only data observed up to day S, the last day of exposure to the common infective source, are used for testing to make the comparison fair, because the asymptotic test cannot handle data beyond day S + \u03b4 max . The resampling method has two variations, one involving only the initial permutation stage, and the other having both stages. The former is referred to as the simple permutation test, which is widely applied to many problems; and the latter is called the refined permutation test in this paper to make a distinction between these two variations. We shall show through simulations that the refined permutation test has some advantages over both the simple permutation test and the asymptotic test for small sample sizes, and that the three tests tend to be equivalent for large sample sizes. By large sample size, we mean both a relatively large population and a large number of cases of the disease. We first present simulation results in Table 2 for a small population composed of 4 households, each of size 5. Values of b and p 1 are chosen to cover a full range of statistical power levels. When p 1 = 0, the reported values are type I errors. Clearly, the refined permutation test preserves type I error at the specified level of 0.05 for all settings of b. The asymptotic test is the most conservative in rejecting the true null hypothesis by having the smallest type I errors when there are 10 or fewer cases. Surprisingly, the simple permutation test is also conservative when there are only few cases, but less so than the asymptotic test. When b is as large as 0.03 (CPI = 0.6), all methods preserve type I error equally well. In terms of statistical power, the refined permutation test is superior to both of the other two methods. The simple permutation test, however, has the lowest power when there is a fair number of secondary (nonindex) cases, especially when both b and p 1 are large.In Table 3 the population size is increased to 500 with 100 households. Similar to Table 3 , we observe that the asymptotic test is conservative with the type I errors much lower than 0.05. When p 1 is relatively small, that is, at the second row for each level of b, the asymptotic test is not as powerful as the resampling methods. The three methods tend to have the same performance when p 1 increases. Again, the refined permutation method seems to be the best choice in these circumstances.""}",A resampling-based test to detect person-to-person transmission of infectious disease,"Early detection of person-to-person transmission of emerging infectious diseases such as avian influenza is crucial for containing pandemics.

Re-cycling hens toward the end of egg production cycle."", ""Physiological control of reproduction"": ""Embryonic development of the reproductive systemIn contrast to the situation in mammals, the sex chromosomes in male birds are ZZ (homozygous) compared to ZW (heterozygous) in females. In males, the two testes are internal and accessory organs such as the prostate and seminal vesicles are absent. The testes develop due to gene dosing with increased expression of the Z-linked transcription factor gene, doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1). 6, 7 Anti-M\u20ac ullerian hormone (AMH) is synthesized and secreted by the embryonic testis with greater expression in the embryonic testes than the ovaries. 8e10 AMH directs the regression of the paired M\u20ac ullerian ducts. 8e10 In females, only the left ovary and oviduct develop in all avian species and closely related dinosaurs; the latter based on fossil evidence from the early Cretaceous period. 11 The avian oviduct is derived from the embryonic M\u20ac ullerian duct; the former term encompassing the entire reproductive tract from infundibulum to the cloaca. 7 Regression of the right oviduct is induced by AMH. 10 Parenthetically, AMH also plays an important role in development of tubules in the testes. 8, 9 The embryonic female gonad expresses the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of estrogens, aromatase (CYP19A1) but expression is not found in the embryonic male gonads. 12, 13 In turn, the estrogens, such as estradiol, induce growth of the oviduct. 7"", ""Egg development"": ""The egg is comprised of the yolk, yolk membranes, egg white, shell membranes and finally the egg shell. Each of these components are developed along specific regions of the female reproductive tract together with the ovary."", ""Yolk"": ""The egg yolk is a mature ovum (oocyte) that is produced by the ovary. The maturation of the ovum involves multiple processes including deposition of yolk proteins/lipids. Yolk protein/lipoproteins/phosphoproteins were assigned to three categories based on centrifugation of diluted yolk:\u2022 Low-density fraction with a very high lipid composition \u2022 Granules composed of heavy and light chain lipovitellins, phosvitin and a yolk glycoprotein. 14 \u2022 Soluble proteins.The soluble proteins 15 consist of the following:\u2022 a livetins (serum albumen)\u2022 b livetins (serum a 2 -globulin containing transport proteins) \u2022 g livetins (serum g -globulin predominantly immunoglobulin Y).Egg yolk livetins (a, b, and g-livetin) have recently been shown to exert anti-inflammatory properties. 16 Yolk precursors: Yolk precursors are synthesized in the liver. Two major yolk precursors are very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and vitellogenin.Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) has the following characteristics:\u2022 Globular micelle-like \u2022 Non-polar core of triglycerides and cholesterol esters \u2022 Coated with amphiphilic mix of phospholipid, free cholesterol (FC) and twp apolipoproteins. 17 Chicken vitellogenin has been purified from plasma of estrogen treated adult male chickens. 18 It is a dimer with a molecular weight 480,000. 18 It is a dimer composed of two polypeptide monomers each with a molecular weight of about 170,000. 19 There are about 220e235 phosphate moieties per monomer vitellogenin 18 and the lipid component is about 20%. Hepatic expression of vitellogenin is induced by estrogens. 19 Yolk deposition: A specific receptor is responsible for transfer of vitellogenin and verylow-density lipoprotein (VLDL) across the oocyte plasma membrane to fill the oocyte with yolk. 20, 21 Within the oocyte, vitellogenin is cleaved proteolytically to form the yolk proteins, heavy and light chain lipovitellin (20% lipid), phosvitin and a yolk glycoprotein. These are incorporated into yolk granules. Deposition of g livetins is very high in small follicles <200 mg, 22 but decreases during development of large follicles. 23 For the last four days of development of the follicles, yolk is being deposited at 2.5 cm 3 or greater per day. 24 Once the ovum (egg yolk) has matured, ovulation is stimulated by the pituitary hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH). An extensive explanation of hormonal control of female reproduction follows. If ovulation is successful the ovum is normally received into the infundibulum."", ""Egg white"": ""The egg white or albumin of the egg is produced by the magnum of the oviduct. The magnum is the longest section of the oviduct where the ovum spends approximately 4 h accumulating egg white proteins. 25 Among the constituents of egg white are the following proteins:\u2022 Ovalbumen -50% of egg white proteins \u2022 Ovotransferrin (conalbumen) 12% (this chelates metal ions particularly iron) \u2022 Ovomucoid -11% \u2022 Lysozyme -3.5% \u2022 Ovomucin 1e3% \u2022 Avidin 0.05%. 26 Antimicrobial peptides and proteins 27e29 are present in the egg white and include the following:\u2022 Gallin or ovodefensin \u2022 b-defensin 11 \u2022 Cathelicidin \u2022 Cystatin -a cysteine protease inhibitor \u2022 Lysozyme-a bacteriolytic enzyme \u2022 Ovoinhibitor."", ""Eggshell membranes"": ""Following albumin deposition and addition of water (\""plumping fluid\"") to the developing egg, the eggshell membrane is added in the isthmus; this taking approximately 1 h. 25 The eggshell membranes are 93% protein 30 contains proteins including collagens, ovoalbumin, bacteriolytic enzymes such as ovotransferrin and lysozyme together with clusterin peptides and ovodefensins/defensins such as gallin. 30, 31 These are also glycosaminoglycans including galactosaminoglycan. 32, 33 Egg shellThe formation of the egg shell in the uterus/ shell gland is the final yet it is of longest in duration taking approximately 19 h. 25 This is due to the extensive structure of the shell.

Production of spermatozoa is critical to fertilization of the ovulated ovum and, hence, the production of broiler chicks (see Broiler breeder reproduction section), layer pullet chicks and turkey poults (see Artificial insemination section).Spermatogenesis is a complex process that is tightly regulated by neuroendocrine and endocrine mechanisms (discussed later in hormonal control of reproduction). 36, 37 Spermatozoa are produced in the seminiferous tubules of the testes. 36, 37 Each mature spermatozoan consists of an acrosome containing the nucleus that holds the DNA information, attached to a microtubular flagella enabling it to be propelled from the cloaca of the hen to the infundibulum of the oviduct. Once spermatozoa enter the vagina of the oviduct, they are stored in the utero-vaginal junctions or the infundibular sperm storage tubules. 36 Similar number of utero-vaginal junctions can be found in commercial broiler breeders and turkeys. 38 Spermatozoa can retain their ability to fertilize the oocyte for several weeks, however fertility begins to decline post 7 days after insemination and is markedly lower 10 days after insemination. 39 "", ""Hormonal control of reproduction"": ""Hormones are critically important to the optimal functioning of the gonads, the photoperiodic stimulation of reproduction, sexual and maternal behavior and induced molting. The major androgen produced by the testes is testosterone. Interestingly, it was demonstrated by Berthold in 1849, in the first endocrine study, that a testicular factor was essential to both male behaviors such as crowing, mating and aggression in chickens and to the development of the secondary sexual characteristics such as the rooster's comb and wattle.Pituitary gland and reproduction: The gonads are controlled by the anterior pituitary hormones, LH and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). These gonadotropins play a critical role in the development and maintenance of the gonads. LH stimulates production of progesterone by granulosa cells from large follicles 40 and testosterone by Leydig cells of the testes. 41 FSH increases proliferation of granulosa cells, expression of both steroidogenic acute regulator (StAR) and inhibin a genes in granulosa cells and release of progesterone with the effect progressively greater with tissue from larger follicles. 42, 43 In addition, prolactin can exert an inhibitory effect on the chicken ovary. 44 Hypothalamic control of gonadotropin release: There are two gonadotropin releasing hormones (GnRHs) in the chicken (cGnRH-I and cGnRH-II) and two receptors for GnRH (cGnRHR1 and cGnRHR3). GnRH-II is much more potent than GnRH-I in hens in stimulating LH release by 36 fold. 45 However, GnRH-II is not detected in the median eminence. 46, 47 There is high expression of GnRHR3 in the pituitary gland. 48 Therefore, the releasing hormone for LH is chicken GnRH-I and the receptor is cGnRHR3.Chicken gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) is a peptide with 12-amino-acids. 49 While GnIH inhibits both the synthesis and the release of gonadotropins in chickens, 50 the physiological relevance of GnIH still requires clarification.The ovary produces the following:\u2022 Estrogens, primarily estradiol. Estrogens induce the following: development of the oviduct, production of yolk precursors (VLDL and vitellogenin) (see above) by the liver, production of egg white proteins by the oviduct and, with androgens, formation of medullary bone (a labile source of calcium). In addition, estrogens allow the expression of female behaviors and moderate the release of luteinizing hormone (LH). \u2022 Progesterone. Among its roles are stimulating production of a specific egg white protein (avidin) and stimulating the release of LH. \u2022 Androgens, predominantly testosterone.Androgens are essential to the development of medullary bone. 26, 51 Ovarian hormones and growth factors also play critical roles in follicular development. For instance, activin A increases expression of both FSH and LH receptors but decreases cell proliferation of granulosa cells. 52 Moreover, development of small follicles is suppressed by epidermal growth factor receptor ligands such as transforming growth factor a. 57 In contrast, bone morphogenetic protein 6 enhanced responsiveness to FSH. 43, 53 Testicular functioning is controlled in a similar manner to the ovary. LH stimulates the Leydig cells to produce testosterone. 41 The Sertoli cells produce nutrients to the maturing spermatozoa and are under the control of FSH. Testosterone is produced from the Leydig cells."", ""Light and reproduction Photoperiodic induction of reproduction"": ""There is seasonality of egg production in chickens when held under a natural photoperiod in the temperate zone. Egg production increases markedly after the winter solstice and declines beginning prior to the autumnal equinox. 54 The physiological basis of this annual cycle is photoperiodic stimulation of reproduction by long daylengths; these inducing the development of functioning gonads. 54 Red light is detected by photo-pigments in the hypothalamus 54e56 with the most important photoreceptor influencing the hypothalamic release of GnRH-I being red opsin. 55 The photoperiodic mechanism involves light coinciding temporarily with the light sensitive (photo-sensitive) phase of a circadian rhythm. This leads to release of GnRH-I, synthesis and secretion of LH and FSH and, hence, gonadal resurgence. 54 Chickens Pullets are reared under short daylengths (6L:18D or 8L:16D). They are transferred to longer daylengths (12L:12D) at breed specific physiological ages 45 to stimulate gonadal development. In studies where pullets were transferred to daylengths of 10L:14D or 11L:13D, plasma concentrations of LH did not increase, but marked increases in plasma concentrations of LH daylengths were observed with daylengths 13L:11D or greater. 54 Perhaps surprisingly, daylengths were interpreted differently depending on the previous photoperiod. Transfer of pullets from photoperiods of either 4L:20D or 20L:4D to 12L:12D were followed by, respectively increases and decreases in plasma concentrations of LH. 54 Thus, the same photoperiod can be interpreted as either photostimulatory or photoinhibitory.Commercially, pullets are brought into lay by increasing both the photoperiod and the light intensity (Table 20. 3). There are breed and genetic line specific differences between ages at "", ""Reproductive management of poultry"": ""which photostimulation is performed (see Table 20 .3). Egg production in broiler breeder hens is improved when photostimulation is delayed from 18 to 21 weeks old. 57 There is also evidence that it may be advantageous to delay photostimulation of broiler breeders to 24 weeks old. 58 Turkeys: Turkeys come into lay with increasing daylengths. 59 There are seasonal differences (see Table 20 .4). 60 There is a rapid increase in plasma concentrations of both LH and FSH when males and females are exposed to long day-lengths. 61 "", ""Photorefractoriness and reproduction"": ""Photorefractoriness is the loss of the ability to respond to the stimulatory effects of long photoperiods. Photorefractoriness can be \""broken\"" by re-exposure to short day-lengths. This is seen in turkeys with prolonged exposure to long day-lengths with the signs of photorefractoriness being decreased egg production and molting. 59, 60 The decline in egg production during the production cycle of chickens might also be attributed to photorefractoriness. Indeed, there is greater sensitivity of older hens to reduced daylength with an over 90% decrease in egg production in 105 weeks old hens compared to a 26% decline in 28 weeks old hens. 62 Moreover, plasma concentrations of LH were only decreased in the older hens. 62 "", ""Light intensity and poultry reproduction"": ""While, light intensities greater than 1 lux are required for photoperiodic induction of egg production, 63 considerably higher light intensities are employed in commercial poultry production (Table 20. 3). For instance, in broiler breeders, light intensity is increased from before photostimulation about 6 lux in the pullet phase to >50 lux after photostimulation at 21 or 22 weeks of age. 64 Other effects of light intensity: Light intensity has other effects. For instance, increasing light intensity in immature pullets is associated with increased plasma concentrations of FSH. 65 Moreover, the ability of a short pulse of light to photostimulate chickens is influenced by light intensity. 66 In addition, the ratio of the light intensity during the subjective day to that during the subjective night is important in entraining the rhythm of oviposition. 67 Nutrition and reproductive management Overview In poultry, nutrition is integrally linked to the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis. It has been known for 50 years that egg production in hens stops quickly following fasting. 68 The administration of mammalian or avian gonadotropin restores, albeit partially, egg production in starved hens 68 ; this suggesting that underlying cause is the lack of pre-ovulatory LH surges. Fasting is followed rapidly by decreases in plasma concentrations of LH, 69 body weight together with precipitous declines in ovarian and oviductal weights. 70 Similarly, production of eggs and plasma concentrations of LH decrease quickly after reducing calcium or sodium in the diet of hens. 71,72 In young chickens, protein deficiency also has been demonstrated to rapidly cause atrophy of gonads, decrease circulating concentrations of LH and depress responsiveness to GnRH. 73 "", ""Nutrition and reproductive management"": ""The NRC Nutrient Requirements of Poultry has been invaluable to researchers and important to the poultry industry recommending minimum levels of nutrients in the feed. 74 These requirements are based on the published research prior to the development of the specific edition of NRC Nutrient Requirements of Poultry. Primary breeders publish age specific nutrient recommendations for each of their genetic lines. 64,75e77 Examples of such recommendations for energy, protein, lysine and calcium are summarized in Table 20 .5. It is clear that the recommendations for calcium content in laying hen diets are very high due to the demands of eggshell formation. Moreover, the levels of calcium in diets are higher as the production cycle proceeds presumably due to the increasing size of the egg. This is the case irrespective of whether the recommendations are for layer or broiler breeder hens (Table 20 .5)."", ""Nutrition of broiler breeder pullets and reproductive management"": ""Feedingprogramsare designed toachievetarget body weights throughout growth with markedly lower weights at 24 weeks old (ad libitum fed 5.65 kg; restricted to achieve target weights 3.06 kg). 78 These programs not only decrease the feed needs of the broiler breeder but also reduce mortality and increase egg production. 78 Broiler breeder pullets can be fed nutrient restricted diets by programs where birds are fed daily or skip-a-day or feeding four or five or six days per week. There were greater body weights and lower liver weights in 16 week-old pullets fed daily than skip-a-day despite the birds despite their receiving the same amount of feed. 79 There were also higher hepatic concentrations of both lipid and glycogen together with the expression of lipogenic enzymes in skip-a-day fed pullets. 79, 80 Mench considered that feed restrict of broiler breeder females may be associated with physiological stresses and increased incidence of abnormal behaviors. 81 The severity of feed restriction needs to be progressively greater with generation exhibiting increased size/growth rates in broiler chickens. 82 The strategy in feed restriction is to reduce caloric intake while maintaining amount of feed consumed. This goal is achieved by increasing the percentage of crude fiber in the diet. Skip-a-day programs have been considered helpful in increasing uniformity within flocks and reducing abnormal behaviors. 83 Induced molting or re-cycling to increase egg production Hens can be induced (or forced) to molting at the end of their laying cycle resulting in improved egg production at a lower cost than using replacement pullets (Fig. 20.1 ). In the USA, 19.7 % of laying hens are molted (re-cycled) each month. 5 This process can involve severe nutritional restriction including starvation and/or withholding water and/or reduction in photoperiod. 70,84e86 Alternate methods of induced molting include an extremely high zinc diet (20,000 ppm) followed by a conventional layer feed beginning at day 12 87 and sodium/chloride-deficient diets. 88, 89 Broiler breeders are rarely molted, but under certain circumstances, molting may be performed. Most broiler breeder molt programs are achieved by restricting feed consumption and supplementing water containing essential micronutrients allowing utilization of fat stores. This reduced fat stores such that hens achieve a more pullet-like body composition before being photostimulated again. In addition to feed restriction, to induce molting in broiler breeder hens, the daylength is decreased to 8L:16D and light intensity is reduced. 85,86 Production levels with molted broiler breeders are about 10% less than their previous laying cycle. 85, 86 The lower production level appears to be due to there being fewer follicles after a forced molt compared to their initial lay cycle. 25 The terms, forced or induced molt, are open to question as it presumes that molting (loss of feathers) causes rejuvenation of reproduction performance. Molting occurs after resumption of normal feeding and is temporally shifted from ovarian recrudescence (see Fig. 20 .2). When feed is withdrawn for 8 days and water withdraw for 2 days, egg production had completely ceased by 6 days (see Fig. 20 .2). 90 Molting occurred after the resumption of feeding and there were concomitant increases in circulating concentrations of T 3 and corticosterone (see Fig. 20 .2). 90 Circulating concentrations of LH, estradiol (E 2 ) and progesterone were lower in molting hens than in laying hens or fully recycled hens. 90 The effects of an industry molting system on organ weights together with circulating concentrations of ions and corticosterone were evaluated. 91 The approach was to combine salt and protein deprivation 91 This approach is effective in stopping egg production and decreasing body weight and organ weights. 91 It is accompanied by reductions in circulating concentrations of sodium and chloride (see Table 20 .6). 91 The egg production cycle of about 21 weeks of age to 45e60 weeks old can be extended with a molt between 108 and 120 weeks old. 91 The physiological mechanism underlying induced molting included decreased release of GnRH from the median eminence and consequently lack of the pre-ovulatory LH surge. Ovulation completely ceased with 4 days of feed withdrawal. 92 Plasma concentrations of LH and progesterone were decreased with 2 days of feed withdrawal. 92 The GnRH content of the median eminence was similarly decreased but not until 4 days of feed withdrawal. 92 There are also decreases in the number of gonadotropes expressing LH. 93 Oviductal regression occurs due to lack of estrogens and is accompanied by increased expression of peptidases with, for example, expression of the peptidase, cathepsin L. 94 It is questioned whether re-cycling/forced molting of hens is consistent with one of the \""The Five Freedoms,\"" namely: \""1. Freedom from hunger and thirst\"" and the need for \""ready access to fresh water and a diet to maintain full health and vigor.\"" 95 There is both evidence for and against the process being physiologically stressful. An indicator of stress, heterophil: lymphocyte ratio, was increased after 7 days after feed withdrawal to a forced molt. 96 Similarly, induction of molting was accompanied by increased the percentage of heterophils (day 7 and 14) and of eosinophils in one study. 97 However, the evidence of molt induction influencing plasma concentration of the stress hormone, corticosterone, is circumspect. No changes in plasma concentrations of corticosterone in force molted hens were reported (also see Table 20 .6). 91, 94 In laying hens subjected to induced molting, plasma concentrations of corticosterone were higher on day 10 in hens subjected to complete Induced molting or re-cycling to increase egg production feed withdrawal than those in which molting was induced by a high zinc diet or in a wholegrain barley diet. 98 There are also shifts in immune responses including cytokine expression. During starvation induction of molting, there is a reduced delayed type hypertensive response in the wattle. 99 Feed withdrawal for 6e8 days is associated with increased oviductal expression of the following: interleukin (IL)-6, IL 8 and interferon g. 100 Similarly, expression of cytokines in response to an endotoxin challenge increased in the uterus of molting compared to laying hens. 101 Other aspects of reproductive management in poultry"", ""Artificial insemination"": ""Artificial insemination (AI) is used very widely in turkey production but not in the production of layer pullets or broiler chicks. 102 Hens are inseminated weekly with diluted semen (for spermatozoa concentrations in turkey ejaculate see Table 20 .2). While the technique is labor intensive, it takes advantage of the presence of spermatozoa storage glands in the oviduct. 102 These release spermatozoa after oviposition such that newly ovulated ovum can be fertilized prior to the addition of egg white, membranes and the she1l. 102 The AI techniques that were developed for poultry have been applied to the conservation of endangered wild birds when they fail to mate in captive conditions. 103 AI can be employed alone or coupled with cryopreservation. 103 "", ""Approaches to reduce broodiness"": ""It is advantageous to suppress broodiness (maternal behavior) and the consequent decrease in egg production in poultry. Broodiness has been effectively genetically eliminated in commercial chickens irrespective of whether broilers or laying hens. 104 Approaches that could reduce the unfavorable effects of broodiness in turkeys include: genetics and active or passive immunization with antisera reducing available prolactin. Administration of antisera to turkey prolactin increased egg production in turkeys. 105 An alternate approach is active immunization. Similarly, egg production was markedly increased in turkey hens actively immunized against VIP (with VIP being conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin) due to impairment of prolactin release and consequently reduction in incubation behavior(s). 106, 107 It was hoped that antisera could also enhance reproduction in males. Young male chickens exhibited multiple changes after active immunization against both inhibin and VIP. These included increases in semen volume and spermatozoa mobility together with spermatozoa concentrations. 108 In contrast, this improvement in reproductive performance was not seen in old roosters actively immunized against both inhibin and VIP. 109 Antibody approaches do not appear to be widely adopted due to expense of registration.Cage free (colony), conventional, enriched and free-range systems Both egg production and bird health are influenced by the systems employed to maintain (chicken) hens. Egg production was greater in the hens in conventional caging compared to an aviary system. Much lower (w40%) mortalities were reported in hens in conventional caging compared to an aviary system. 110 Moreover, there was a greater incidence of keel deformities in hens in a cage free system compared to those in conventional cages. 111 There are also differences in leg bone characteristics with hens under the cage free conditions having increased cortical cross-sectional area and cortical density of their humerus and tibia compared to those maintained in conventional cages. 112 Moreover, there was there was greater stiffness of both humerus and tibia and increased percentage ash in the humerus in hens in a cage free system. 112,113 20 . Reproductive management of poultry However, in another study, there were little differences between tibia and humerus parameters between hens in cage-free or conventional cage systems. 111 In laying hens at the end of the laying cycle, there were differences in bone characteristics depending on the environment under which the pullets were raised. 112 Production has been compared between Lohmann Brown layer hens in convention layer housing, enriched convention layer housing and free-range systems. Perhaps unexpectedly, egg production was greater in hens in a freerange system (average production over cycle 89.3%) compared to conventional layer housing (87.3% with enrichment and 87.1% without). 94 In contrast, there was greater feed intake and higher feed conversion ratios in hens in a freerange system. 114 In another study, egg production was greater in hens with an enriched environment compared to conventional caging. 110 "", ""Ovulation issues in broiler breeders"": ""Broiler breeders are prone to ovulation issues. Examples include internal ovulation and double ovulation of a (double \""yolked\"" eggs). The latter is due to pair of large yellow follicles in the follicular hierarchy. 25 Duplicate ovulation is considered to be a result of \""over-stimulated\"" hens coming into production or pullets not ready for light stimulation or to over-feeding. 113, 115 Internal lay of the ovum is followed the constituents of ovum being absorbed, but can result in a substrate for bacterial growth like Escherichia coli. 116 Uses of components of eggs Yolk as source of antibodies A major soluble protein type in yolk are the g livetins or the immunoglobulins (discussed section above). Yolk IgY from chicken immunized against pathogens (rotaviruses, bovine coronavirus, enterotoxigenic E. coli and Salmonella spp.) offers potential to replace antibiotics in livestock production. This may be particularly important with the restriction of antibiotic use and growing consumer resistance to their use. A meta-analysis of 22 studies determine that hyperimmune yolk IgY was effective against diarrhea in piglets. 117 Similarly, oral administration of IgY was efficacious in poultry and calves. 117, 118 Other products of eggs Egg white and its constituents have important functional properties. Examples include the following. Avidin is used in multiple biochemical tests. Lysozyme (bacteriostatic and bactericidal) has been used as a preservative, for instance, in cheese making. 27 Egg shell membranes or egg shell membrane powder have been used as natural bandage for burns and injuries in traditional Asian medicine. Egg shell membrane powder and its carbohydrate constituents have been recently been demonstrated to exert anti-inflammatory effects 119, 120 supporting their effectiveness."", ""Transgenic chickens as bioreactors"": ""In the chick embryo, primordial germ cells migrate from the germinal crescent to the genital ridge ultimately becoming male or female gametes. The primordial germ cells carry the genetics to the next generation and, thus, if this can be manipulated we have a multi-generational method of producing transgenic animals. Chicken primordial germ cells can be obtained from blood of chick embryos and maintained in culture. 121 This has been used to both insert and/or \""knock out\"" genes. 121 Transgenic hens can be used as bioreactors to produce pharmaceutical proteins in their egg white when oviduct specific promoters are used. 122 This concept has been applied to the production of human erythropoietin 123 and tumor necrosis factor receptors. 115 ""}",Chapter 20 Reproductive management of poultry,"Abstract Based on data from the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization, about 120 million metric tons of poultry meat were produced globally in 2016. In addition, about 82 million metric tons of eggs were produced. One of the bases for this production is the reproductive efficiency of today's poultry. This, in turn, is due to their inherent reproductive physiology, intensive genetic selection and advances in husbandry/management. The system of reproduction in males in largely similar to that in mammals except that there is no descent of testes. In females, there are marked differences with there being a single ovary and oviduct; the latter being the name of the differentiated entire Müllerian duct. Moreover, females produce eggs with a yolky oocyte surrounded by albumen, membranes and shell. Among the most successful reproductive management techniques are optimizing photoperiod, light intensity and nutrition. Widespread employment of these has allowed maximizing production. Laying hens can be re-cycled toward the end egg production. Other aspects of reproductive management in poultry include the following: artificial insemination (almost exclusively employed in turkeys) and approaches to reduce broodiness together with cage free (colony), conventional, enriched and free-range systems.",10.1016/b978-0-12-817052-6.00020-3,Elsevier; PMC,PMC7153309,,els-covid,2020-12-31,Animal Agriculture,,,,214189934.0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128170526000203; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128170526000203,2020.0,paper

Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these three nematode viruses form a distinct clade of viruses that are distantly, but most closely related to viruses in the family Nodaviridae. The discovery of these viruses and their ability to infect the genetically tractable model organisms Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae provides a new opportunity for the study of hostvirus interactions. While the ability of these viruses to infect nematodes has been established, many fundamental aspects of the molecular virology of these viruses, including the complement of proteins expressed by these viruses, remain unknown.Nodaviruses are non-enveloped icosahedral viruses with a bipartite positive sense RNA genome (Ball and Johnson, 1999; Odegard et al., 2010; Venter and Schneemann, 2008) . The nodavirus genome consists of two 5 0 capped and 3 0 non-polyadenylated single stranded positive sense RNA segments. The RNA1 segment, typically $3 kb to 3.4 kb, encodes an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that is essential for viral transcription and replication. In addition, there is a subgenomic transcript derived from the RNA1 segment, which encodes both the B1 protein within the same frame and the B2 protein in the \u00fe1 frame relative to the polymerase. The nodavirus B2 protein is a functional viral suppressor of RNA silencing (Chao et al., 2005) , while the function of the B1 protein remains unknown. The RNA2, $ 1.4 kb, encodes the viral capsid protein (alpha) which is subsequently cleaved into beta and gamma peptides during virus maturation in at least a subset of the nodaviruses. The most widely studied nodavirus is Flock house virus (FHV), which can infect a wide range of host cells, including mammalian, insect, plant, and yeast cells (Johnson and Ball, 1997; Lu et al., 2005; Price et al., 1996; Selling et al., 1990; Venter and Schneemann, 2008) .Orsay, Le Blanc and Santeuil viruses differ from nodaviruses in several distinct ways. For example, there is currently no experimental evidence that any of these three viruses generates a subgenomic transcript from the RNA1 genome segment, and thus they appear to lack B1/B2 proteins. Most strikingly, these three viruses have much larger RNA2 segments than the nodaviruses. In all three viruses, a novel ORF delta whose theoretical product has no homology to any known protein in GenBank occupies the 3 0 half of the RNA2 segment. Currently, the function of delta is unknown. A first step towards evaluating the potential function of the delta ORF would be to establish whether it is in fact expressed in vivo. In the absence of a subgenomic transcript, non-5 0proximal ORFs in RNA viruses are commonly expressed via ribosomal frameshifting, a mechanism whereby specific signals usually in the mRNAstimulate a proportion of ribosomes to change reading frame, most commonly in the \u00c0 1 direction, and continue translating an alternative ORF to produce a 'transframe' fusion protein (Firth and Brierley, 2012) . Ribosomal \u00c01 frameshifting was first identified in Rous sarcoma virus (Jacks et al., 1988) , and later found to be utilized by many virusesincluding retroviruses, astroviruses and coronavirusesfor polymerase expression (Brierley, 1995) . Moreover, a few viruses use ribosomal frameshifting to append an extension domain onto a proportion of their capsid proteins (van der Wilk et al., 1997) . The eukaryotic \u00c01 ribosomal frameshift site typically consists of a 'slippery' heptanucleotide sequence fitting the consensus motif X_XXY_YYZ, where XXX normally represents any three identical nucleotides (though certain exceptions have been found, such as GUU and GGA); YYY represents AAA or UUU; Z represents A, C or U; and underscores separate codons in the original reading frame. This consensus motif is generally followed by a stimulatory element comprising a stable RNA secondary structure such as a pseudo-knot or stem-loop, beginning 5-9 nt downstream of the shift site.In this study, we determined that the Orsay virus delta ORF is primarily expressed as a fusion protein with the alpha ORF via a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. This fusion protein copurified with the major capsid protein and viral RNA after gradient ultracentrifugation, suggesting that it is incorporated into Orsay virus particles. In addition, we defined multiple physical properties of Orsay virus such as the virion density and diameter. Collectively these data provide new insights into the fundamental biology of this clade of viruses and provide a basic foundation for future exploitation of the virus-nematode infection system."", ""Complete genome of Orsay virus"": ""In the initial publication describing the discovery of Orsay and Santeuil viruses, we reported partial sequences of the RNA1 and RNA2 segments of Orsay virus (GenBank: HM030970.1, HM030971.1) (Felix et al., 2011) . Here, we sequenced the complete genome of Orsay virus using a combination of 5 0 and 3 0 RACE to define the segment termini. The complete RNA1 segment was 3421 nt while the RNA2 segment was 2574 nt. Standard gene prediction using AUG as a start codon suggested that the RNA2 encodes a putative capsid protein (nt 500 to 1261; $ 28 kDa) and the previously described delta ORF (nt 1345-2385;$ 38 kDa). Curiously, the Orsay capsid annotation yielded a protein much smaller than that predicted for Santeuil and Le Blanc viruses, and resulted in a very long predicted 5 0 UTR. To confirm that there were no sequencing errors leading to misannotation, we repeated 10 independent RT-PCR reactions of the Orsay RNA2 5 0 end, all of which were consistent with the initial sequence. While there were no other AUG codons in frame with the capsid ORF present in the 5 0 end of RNA2, the capsid ORF could be extended up to 156 codons in the 5 0 direction if initiation were to occur at a non-AUG codon (Firth and Brierley, 2012) . Such a non-AUG initiated ORF could encode a protein with a molecular size of up to $ 45 kDa. Moreover, alignment of the N-terminally extended Orsay virus capsid sequence with the corresponding sequences of Le Blanc and Santeuil viruses demonstrated extensive sequence conservation in the region 5 0 to the first in-frame AUG codon in all three viruses The largest possible ORF that could be generated by a non-AUG start in RNA2 is shown. Green and red bars indicate where the peptide sequences were used to generate alpha and delta peptide derived antibodies, respectively. (B) Alignment of the 5 0 -proximal regions of RNA2 of all three nematode viruses conceptually translated in the capsid reading frame (' \u266f ' in sequence represents a stop codon). Arrows indicate the first methionine in each sequence. The red bar shows the Orsay virus capsid N-terminal sequence confirmed by sequencing. Sequence in grey shows the conceptual N-terminal translation back to the first in-frame stop codon for Orsay virus. For LeBlanc virus and Santeuil virus, ORF products were also conceptually translated without requiring AUG for initiation. For clarity, the LeBlanc reading frame was truncated to match the length of the maximal Orsay ORF. (Fig. 1B) , raising the possibility that all three viruses may utilize non-AUG initiation to express their capsid proteins."", ""Western blotting of Orsay virus infected C. elegans"": ""In order to detect the viral proteins translated from the RNA2 segment, we generated polyclonal antibodies raised against synthesized peptides from the capsid and the putative delta protein (Fig. 1A) . Both capsid and delta peptide derived antibodies specifically bound proteins in Orsay virus infected C. elegans as compared to mock infected C. elegans ( Fig. 2A) . The anti-capsid antibody detected a band with a molecular size higher than 37 kDa compared to the protein molecular size marker. This band migrated more slowly than expected for the capsid protein based on its theoretical size, $28 kDa, if translation initiated at the first in-frame AUG codon, but was potentially consistent with translation initiation at an upstream (i.e. non-AUG) codon (up to 45 kDa). In addition, a second band migrating between 75 kDa and 100 kDa was detected in the infected C. elegans with capsid peptide derived antibodies, but not in the mock infected C. elegans. With the anti-delta derived antibody, no protein band that matched the theoretical translational size of the delta ORF ($ 38 kDa if AUG-initiated) was detected. Instead, a single band migrating between 75 kDa and 100 kDa was clearly detected in the infected C. elegans lysates. These observations raised the possibility that the two antibodies may be detecting a common protein derived from the RNA2 segment. One plausible mechanism that could generate such a protein is ribosomal frameshifting. Analysis of the Orsay virus RNA2 segment demonstrated the presence of a putative heptameric slippery sequence, G_UCA_AAC (underscores separate alpha-frame codons), immediately before the alpha ORF stop codon (Fig. 2B ). Although G_UCA_AAC is not normally regarded as a canonical shift site for \u00c0 1 ribosomal frameshifting, it has in fact been tested in reporter constructs and found to be an efficient shift site (Brierley et al., 1992) . Further, we identified by RNA secondary structure modeling with Mfold a putative RNA stem loop structure beginning eight nucleotides downstream of the slippery sequence, consistent with a canonical eukaryotic \u00c01 frameshift cassette (Fig. 2C ). Nucleotide sequence alignment of all three nematode viruses demonstrated conservation of the slippery sequence and the stem loop structure (Fig. 2B) . Notably, we found that Le Blanc virus has the same slippery sequence as that of Orsay virus, while Santeuil virus has a different shift-prone sequence G_GAA_AAC (Brierley et al., 1992) . Although the predicted RNA stem-loop structure has a 2-nt internal symmetric bulge (Fig. 2C ), its base is stabilized by three consecutive G-C base-pairings, and its functional significance is supported by compensatory substitutions (i.e. paired substitutions that preserve the predicted base-pairings), U-A to C-G (lower part of stem, Le Blanc virus) and C-G to U-A (upper part of stem, Santeuil virus). While in some cases of \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting the stimulatory element comprises a simple 3 0 -adjacent RNA stem-loop structure, in many other cases a pseudoknot is involved. In this case, however, analysis with pknotsRG (Reeder et al., 2007) yielded no evidence for a pseudoknot to form in the appropriate location. Collectively, these data suggested that the nematode viruses may utilize a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism to generate a fusion protein of the alpha and delta ORFs with an estimated molecular size of $ 85 kDa (Fig. 2D )."", ""Orsay virus CsCl ultracentrifugation based purification"": ""In order to obtain sufficient quantities of purified viral proteins for biochemical protein analyses, we used CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation to purify Orsay viral particles from large-scale infected C. elegans liquid culture. Western blotting with the anti-capsid antibody yielded a major band slightly above 37 kDa and a minor band between 75 kDa and 100 kDa as seen in the infected lysates (Fig. 3A) . The anti-delta antibody also detected two bands-a major band between 75 kDa and 100 kDa, and a very faint band at$ 42 kDa (Fig. 3B ). This lower band was not detected in the Western blots of infected C. elegans lysates ( Fig. 2A) . It is possible that this band represents a degradation product of the larger alpha-delta fusion, or possibly some form of the delta ORF alone. Its abundance is much lower than that of the fusion band, which may explain why it is not detected in the infected C. elegans lysates ( Fig. 2A) . For both antibodies, the peak fractions of Orsay virus protein (fractions 8-11) were found in a density range of 1.311 g/ml to 1.387 g/ml (Fig. 3C ). For comparison, FHV virions have an average density of 1.351 g/ml (Scotti et al., 1983) .To evaluate whether the peak protein fractions also contained Orsay virus RNA, we performed real time qRT-PCR for both the RNA1 and RNA2 segments. The highest level of both viral RNAs was detected in fractions 8-11, the same fractions as the peak protein levels (Fig. 3D )."", ""N-terminal sequencing of Orsay capsid protein"": ""Orsay virus CsCl density gradient fractions 8 and 9 were pooled and further purified by a second CsCl density gradient. The capsid band from fraction 9 of the second gradient was used for Edman degradation sequencing which demonstrated that the N-terminal sequence was NKNNT ( Table 1 ). The asparagine (Asn) corresponds to nucleotides 89-91, an AAC codon, which is not traditionally thought to be a suitable translation initiation site. In the complete RNA2 segment, there was no AUG codon 5 0 to the codon corresponding to the N-terminal Asn amino acid. The predicted size of the alpha-ORF-encoded protein beginning with this Asn is 42.9 kDa, consistent with its migration in SDS-PAGE. We were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of the alpha-delta fusion from the CsCl gradient purification to perform N-terminal sequencing. "", ""Evidence of Orsay virus ribosomal frameshifting by protein mass spectrometry"": ""To investigate whether Orsay virus uses ribosomal frameshifting, we analyzed the high molecular weight band that migrates between 75 kDa and 100 kDa from fraction 9 of the CsCl gradient by mass spectrometry. In the mass spectrometry peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) analysis, 44% of the sequence of the theoretical alpha-delta fusion protein was detected by MASCOT searching against the custom Orsay virus genome derived protein database. Critically, we detected the peptide SYSLPSSNLGWGNVVR that could only be generated through ribosomal frameshifting on the G_UCA_AAC motif as it included amino acids encoded by the 3 0 end of the alpha ORF linked to amino acids encoded by the sequence downstream of the alpha ORF but in the delta ORF reading frame (i.e. the \u00c0 1 reading frame relative to the alpha ORF) ( Fig. 4A and C) . In the MALDI-MS/MS peptide sequencing analysis, seven of the 15 sequenced peptides mapped to the theoretical alpha-delta fusion protein and six of the seven peptides showed a high ion score (Table 3 ). The MS/MS peptide sequencing spectrum definitively identified the peptide SNLGWGNVVR (Fig. 4B right to left)."", ""Orsay virus alpha-delta fusion protein is present in highly purified virions"": ""We used an orthogonal purification strategy to confirm that the presence of the alpha-delta fusion in the CsCl gradient fractions with peak capsid protein was not due to contamination or incidental co-purification. Three serial iodixanol gradients were used to purify the Orsay virions to 495% purity based on SDS-PAGE coomassie blue staining (Fig. 5A) . We could clearly detect the alpha-delta fusion protein band in the highly purified fraction by both Western blot and coomassie staining (Fig 5A) . This observation, together with the CsCl density gradient results, demonstrated that the alpha-delta fusion protein is likely assembled into the Orsay virions. There was also an additional faint protein band above the fusion protein band recognized by the anti-capsid antibody, which might reflect post translational modification of the fusion protein. This band was not observed with the anti-capsid antibody in either the infected C. elegans lysates or in the CsCl gradient fractions nor was it detected by the anti-delta antibody in this preparation. Because of the high purity of the iodixanol purified virions, greater quantities of virus were loaded onto the analytical gels than in the previous experiments, which may explain why it was not detected in the other experiments. From this purification, we were able to obtain sufficient quantities of the alpha-delta fusion protein to perform N-terminal sequencing, which yielded the identical N-terminus, NKNNT, as with the capsid protein (Table 2) ."", ""EM study of the Orsay virion morphology"": ""We performed negative staining with uranyl acetate on the purified Orsay virions and examined their morphology by electron microscopy. The virus particles have an icosahedral structure, with an average diameter of 34.2 nm (range from 29.4 nm to 39.9 nm; n\u00bc 10 counted). For comparison, FHV virions average 29 nm in diameter Dearing et al. (1980) . In contrast to FHV, clear protrusions on the Orsay virion surface were present (Fig. 5B ) which are not present in either FHV assembled VLPs or FHV virions (Dearing et al., 1980; Schneemann et al., 1993) . We also observed some much smaller particles which could be capsomeres from disrupted Orsay virions. "", ""Discussion"": ""Here we describe for the first time, multiple fundamental properties of Orsay virus. These include the density of the virus particles in CsCl, the first negative stain EM images, the size of the viral particles, evidence for a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism that leads to expression of a novel fusion protein of currently unknown function, and evidence for non-canonical translation initiation for the viral capsid protein.One of the key differences between the three recently discovered nematode infecting viruses, Orsay, Le Blanc and Santeuil, and nodaviruses is the larger RNA2 segment size. In the three nematode viruses, they range from 2.5 kb to 3.0 kb while the nodaviruses have only $ 1.4 kb RNA2 segments. In the original annotation of the RNA2 segment of the nematode infecting viruses, we identified an ORF encoding a product orthologous to the capsid proteins of nodaviruses in the 5 0 half of the RNA2 segment. In the 3 0 half, we identified an ORF of unknown function, the delta ORF. Here we present extensive data demonstrating that the delta ORF is primarily expressed as a fusion with the alpha capsid via ribosomal frameshifting. The alpha-delta fusion was unambiguously identified by mass spectrometry of purified protein through the detection of peptide fragments throughout the fusion protein and critically, the peptide encoded at the ribosomal frameshift site. In two distinct biochemical purification strategies, this fusion protein co-sedimented with the peak virion fractions, demonstrating that it is likely part of the viral particle. Thus, unlike the structures of the FHV virions, which are composed of the alpha capsid protein (cleaved into beta and gamma fragments) (Gallagher and Rueckert, 1988 ) alone, Orsay virus virions appear to contain a mixture of the traditional alpha capsid protein and the alpha-delta fusion protein. The function of the alpha-delta fusion protein remains unknown. It is possible that it plays a role in receptor binding. By analogy, a C-terminal domain appended to a small proportion of luteovirus capsid proteins via stop codon readthrough plays a role in aphid transmission (Brault et al., 1995) . The delta domain may also have additional non-structural roles, as have been described for many viral capsid proteins (Ni and Kao, 2013) . One possibility is that this protein may play a role in antagonizing antiviral pathways in nematodes.At this stage we have little evidence that the predicted delta ORF is expressed in vivo outside of the context of the fusion protein. Only when large quantities of highly purified virions were analyzed did we detect by Western blot a band that could be consistent with a delta ORF protein alone. However the observed band is more likely to be simply a degradation product of the alpha-delta fusion protein as there is no clear mechanism by which delta could be independently expressed. Furthermore, this band was not detected in the final highly purified iodixonal gradient fractions. A recent study that attempted to evaluate whether the delta ORF alone, when cloned into a heterologous expression vector, can act as a suppressor of RNA silencing, yielded a negative result (Guo and Lu, 2013) . However, in light of our data demonstrating that the delta ORF is primarily expressed as a larger fusion with the capsid protein, the potential of the alpha-delta fusion to suppress RNA silencing should be evaluated.During the course of these studies, we noted that the standard AUG-initiation gene prediction models for Orsay virus yielded a capsid protein that is much smaller than expected compared to Le Blanc and Santeuil viruses, as well as when compared to nodaviruses. To address this issue, we experimentally defined the Nterminus of both the capsid protein and the alpha-delta fusion protein of Orsay virus in the context of purified virions. By Nterminal sequencing, NKNNT were defined as the N-terminal amino acids for both proteins. Based on sequence homology, it appears likely that this region is translated as part of the capsid protein in all three nematode viruses (Fig. 1B) . Strikingly, such a protein cannot be derived from an AUG translation initiation site. A number of near-cognate non-AUG codons (e.g. CUG) can support some level of initiation, particularly if in a strong initiation context (Firth and Brierley, 2012) . One possibility is that an upstream UUG triplet at nucleotide 56-58 is used for initiation in Orsay virus, and that a subsequent proteolytic cleavage generates the NKNNT termini found in these proteins in the virion. In the alphanodaviruses, the alpha protein is cleaved into beta and gamma proteins, providing an explicit precedent for such proteolytic cleavage. However the potential for upstream non-AUG initiation at one of the standard near-cognate non-AUG initiation codons (CUG, GUG, UUG, ACG, AUA, AUC, AUU) is not present in Santeuil virus due to an in-frame stop codon just five codons upstream of the sequence encoding NKNNK. Moreover, the UUG codon in Orsay virus lacks a strong initiation context (ggc_UUG_c) (Nakagawa et al., 2008) . It is possible therefore that Orsay virus, and by homology Santeuil and Le Blanc viruses, can initiate capsid translation directly at the site of the NKNNT motif via some unknown mechanism, perhaps akin to the initiator-Met-tRNA-independent initiation utilized in the expression of the dicistrovirus capsid polyprotein (Jang and Jan, 2010 ). The precise mechanism and site of capsid protein initiation will be investigated in future work.We have demonstrated that the delta protein is translated as a fusion protein with alpha and that the fusion protein is most likely incorporated into virions. Nevertheless many questions still remain such as: (1) How is the fusion protein structurally assembled into the virions? (2) What functional role does the fusion protein play in the context of the virion as well as intracellular? (3) Is the fusion protein enzymatically cleaved to release delta protein as many frameshift viral fusion proteins are during virus replication? We are currently pursuing additional biochemical, structural and genetic experiments to address these questions."", ""Material and methods"": ""Orsay virus genome sequencing 5 0 RACE was performed by reverse transcription to synthesize viral cDNA.

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] An extensive multi-disciplinary review conducted in the wake of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic 9 concluded that the relationship between ventilation and indoor airborne transmission of disease was supported by strong and sufficient evidence. Despite this, the potential for transmission in hospitals has received little attention, and there are insufficient data on which to base minimum ventilation rate guidelines. 9 Thus, existing ventilation guidelines, of which there are several (summarized by Beggs et al 10 ) , are not founded on robust scientific evidence related to prevention of airborne transmission.Although some respiratory infections may be communicated by fomites or over short distances (less than a few meters) by large droplets (.20 mm) that subsequently result in direct contact with the respiratory tract, airborne transmission is likely to contribute to person-to-person spread over relatively long distances, due the ability of small droplet nuclei (,5 mm) to remain suspended in air for extended periods. 11 In addition to clear evidence indicating the airborne route is a mode of spread for TB and measles, there is mounting evidence of its role in influenza and rhinovirus transmission. 7, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Given that the significance of knowledge gaps outlined above was amplified by the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, we sought to determine the effect of ventilation on the risk of airborne infection posed by 3 common pathogens in a major teaching hospital. We aimed to provide general information for use in the evaluation of hospital design and infection control strategies and also to inform in-house patient management guidelines."", ""Setting"": ""The Prince Charles Hospital (TPCH) is a major tertiary referral and university hospital located in southeastern Queensland, Australia. TPCH has 588 beds, including a large Pulmonology Unit with 54 inpatient beds. Our study targeted rooms within TPCH that encompassed a range of uses and were potential airborne transmission locations: (1) the Respiratory Investigation (Lung Function) Laboratory (169 m 3 volume), a negativepressure isolation room within the ED (24 m 3 volume), and 2 separate but proximate outpatient consulting rooms (room A, 32 m 3 ; room B, 36 m 3 ). All rooms were mechanically ventilated. The Lung Function Laboratory and outpatient consulting rooms were served by air-handling units (AHUs), with the 2 outpatient consulting rooms sharing a common AHU. The ED isolation room was ventilated entirely by outdoor air drawn in by an exhaust fan."", ""Air-exchange rate measurements"": ""Air-exchange rate measurements in the Lung Function Laboratory and ED isolation room were performed with the room doors in their typical position (fully open and fully closed, respectively), and measurements in the 2 outpatient consulting rooms were performed under both closed-door and open-door conditions, representing a typical functioning outpatient clinic session. All measurements were performed when the rooms were unoccupied. Background concentrations of CO 2 were monitored with a Sable Systems CA-10 CO 2 analyzer (Las Vegas, NV) for at least 20 minutes. High-purity (99.9%) CO 2 was then released and vigorously mixed with room air by 2 fans until concentrations stabilized. The approximate homogeneity of concentration was confirmed by measurements at a minimum of 3 points within each room before the cessation of CO 2 release. A single sampling point was then sited at a central location. The decay of CO 2 was recorded every second until background concentrations were reached. Three repeat measurements were conducted in each room, and for each door position in the outpatient consulting rooms. A total of 18 airexchange measurements were obtained.The gradient of the line of best fit through the natural logarithm of the background-corrected decay was recorded as the number of air changes per hour (ACH). The standard error of the line-fitting procedure was calculated.For all rooms except the ED isolation room, the proportion of outdoor air in the total air volume supplied by their respective AHUs (ie, the combination of outdoor and recirculated air) was determined by mass balance of CO 2 concentrations measured in return, supply, and outdoor air. 17 The precision of calculated values was estimated using the method of Persily. 17"", ""Infection risk modeling"": ""We used the model developed by Gammaitoni and Nucci 18 (G-N) to estimate airborne transmission risk. The G-N model is a variation of the traditional steadystate Wells-Riley (W-R) model. 1 Both models assume that an infectious person constantly generates a number of infectious quanta over time, with a quantum defined as the dose of airborne droplet nuclei required to cause infection in 12e 21 , or 63%, of susceptible persons. Unlike the W-R model, however, the G-N model is capable of incorporating non-steady-state quanta levels. Detailed discussions of each model's merits and underlying assumptions have been provided by Beggs et al 19 and Sze To and Chao. 20 The W-R model iswhere I is the number of infectious source cases, q is the number of infectious quanta produced per source case (quanta/hour), p is the average respiratory ventilation rate of susceptible persons (m 3 /hour), t is the duration of exposure (hours), and Q is the volume of infection-free (ie, outdoor) air supplied to the room (m 3 /hour).The G-N model (when the initial quanta concentration is nonzero) 19 is as follows:where V is the volume of the room (m 3 ), N is the airchange rate (ie, Q/V), and n 0 is the total number of quanta in the room at t 5 0. We modeled 3 diseases spread by the airborne route that spanned a range of infectiousness and frequency of presentation at the study site: influenza, TB, and rhinovirus. Quanta generation rates for these 3 diseases were 67, 12.7, and 5 quanta/hour, respectively, with these values chosen to represent relatively typical cases. 5,21 Although we did not explicitly model H1N1, the influenza quanta generation rate that we used is within its suspected range. 22 We assumed that all susceptible individuals had a standard adult respiratory rate of 0.6 m 3 /hour. 5, 19 The modeling approach and additional equations used are described in the Appendix.Based on typical patient occupancy times and patterns, we modeled 2 general scenarios for each airborne pathogen: the risk of infection for susceptible individuals occupying the Lung Function Laboratory with an infectious patient (exposure times ranging from 15 to 45 minutes), and the risk of infection for susceptible individuals occupying the ED isolation room for between 30 minutes and 8 hours immediately after the departure of an infectious individual who spent 30 minutes or more in the room. We also modeled a third, more complex, situation: the risk of infection for a susceptible individual occupying an outpatient consulting room for up to 120 minutes after previous occupation by an infectious individual for each of 15, 60, and 120 minutes, which spans the range of consultation times for brief to complex multidisciplinary consultations. To mimic typical practice, a 5-minute period during which the door was open was incorporated into each scenario (ie, between the departure of the infectious person and arrival of the susceptible individual). To best assess the capability of the outpatient consulting room's ventilation system at preventing airborne transmission, we investigated the most infectious pathogen (influenza) in that room."", ""Ethical approval"": ""This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees of TPCH (HREC/09/QPCH/163) and Queensland University of Technology (0900001290). Individual patient consent was not required for this study, although signs explaining the purpose of the measurements were displayed to staff, patients, and visitors. Table 1 summarizes the results of air-exchange and outdoor air proportion measurements. The proportion of outdoor air supplied to the Lung Function Laboratory by its AHU was approximately twice that supplied to the outpatient consulting rooms. This discrepancy was traced to a modification of the outdoor air intake dampers performed by technicians 2 years before our investigation. All outdoor air proportions were fixed and did not vary with season, reflecting the small seasonal temperature variation at the study location."", ""RESULTS"": ""A significant finding was the effect of door position on air exchange rates in outpatient consulting rooms A and B, which was most marked in the former and resulted in a near-doubling of air exchange compared with the closed-door situation. We ascribe this to the presence of a large air return air vent in the corridor immediately adjacent to consulting room A that promoted air movement out of the room. This effect was enhanced under open-door conditions. The number of outdoor ACH was equal to the measured ACH rate multiplied by the proportion of outdoor air supplied.Lung Function Laboratory Figure 1 shows the effect of outdoor air-exchange rate on the infection risk of susceptible individuals occupying the Lung Function Laboratory for 15 minutes and for 45 minutes. For all scenarios, risk decreased rapidly with increasing air exchange. The outdoor airexchange rate in the Lung Function Laboratory (4.9 ACH; shown as the vertical dotted line in the figure) was relatively high and resulted in risks ranging from 0.1% after a 15-minute exposure to rhinovirus to 3.6% after a 45-minute exposure to influenza."", ""ED isolation room"": ""Because of the high air-exchange rate in the ED isolation room (23.8 ACH), steady-state quanta concentrations were achieved after approximately 15 minutes.Consequently, these values were low: 0.12 quanta/m 3 for influenza, 0.02 quanta/m 3 for TB, and 0.009 quanta/ m 3 for rhinovirus. The estimated time required to achieve a 99.9% reduction in quanta concentrations after the departure of an infectious individual was 18 minutes. The risk posed to an individual entering the room immediately after the departure of an infectious influenza case (ie, worst-case scenario) and remaining there for 30 minutes or 8 hours was 0.3%. The additional 7.5 hours of occupancy time in the latter case did not have a significant effect on risk, as there were no new sources of influenza quanta in the room. Outpatient consulting rooms Figure 2A shows the modeled influenza quanta concentrations in outpatient consulting room A during a consultation with an infectious individual for up to 120 minutes. The figure also shows the decays in quanta concentrations following departure of the individual after 15, 60, and 120 minutes, including an initial 5-minute period with the room door open. Figure 2B shows the estimated risk of infection for a susceptible individual entering the room after each of these periods.During a 15-minute consultation with an infectious individual, there was insufficient time for the quanta concentration to reach its steady-state value (1.08 quanta/m 3 ). An initially sharp decrease in quanta when the door was opened and the infectious individual departed was curtailed as the air exchange rate decreased once the susceptible individual entered and the door was closed. As shown in Figure 2B , the subsequent risk of infection to the susceptible individual ranged from 3.6% for the 15-minute consultation to 8.8% for the 120-minute consultation.A similar pattern, albeit of greater magnitude, was seen for the 60-and 120-minute consultations with an infectious individual. In these scenarios, quanta concentrations approached their steady-state values at the conclusion of the consultation. When the room had been previously been occupied for 60 minutes by an infectious person, the susceptible individual's estimated infection risk ranged from 8.1% for a 15-minute consultation to 18.5% for a 120-minute consultation. The equivalent range assuming previous occupation by an infectious individual for 120 minutes was 8.8%-20.7%."", ""DISCUSSION"": ""The scarcity of scientific evidence available to underpin ventilation guidelines in hospitals makes modeling studies an attractive approach to developing customized airborne infection control policies. In the present study, we focused on producing conservative risk estimates that reflect the real-world activities of individuals (staff, patients, and visitors) at the study location. It is important to keep in mind that our risk estimates are expressed as percentages, and although this is a convenient and intuitive metric, it might not translate to a significant absolute number of infections in a room with low occupancy. 19, 23 The points at which the existing air exchange rate in the Lung Function Laboratory intersects the curves shown in Figure 1 indicate that increasing air exchange further would provide a negligible reduction to an already very low infection risk. The attendant increase in energy consumption required would be difficult to justify when the size of the room and its typical occupancy of up to 10 persons are considered. 24 A similar situation exists in the ED isolation room, where occupancy was low and outdoor air exchange was very high; even in the worst-case scenario, a very low risk of 0.3% was estimated. The ventilation rate in the ED isolation room afforded substantial protection from the 3 pathogens modeled and was approximately twice that recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for airborne infection isolation rooms. 25 Although the real-world bases of prescribed ventilation guidelines are limited, in these 2 scenarios, modeling demonstrated that measured air exchange limited the infection risk to relatively low levels. For both clinical rooms, in the case of a highly contagious airborne infection and/or highly susceptible group, modeling could be useful when conducted on a caseby-case basis to assess the benefit of increasing air exchange on infection risk.Infections arising from airborne transmission during time spent in a physician's waiting room or consulting room after the departure of an infectious individual have been documented previously. 3, 4 However, those occurrences resulted from a combination of a pediatric source case and a highly infectious airborne pathogen (measles), which were compounded by low outdoor air ventilation rates. Airborne transmission is widely acknowledged as the mechanism of spread of tuberculosis, although its role in influenza and rhinovirus transmission is less well established. 16 Nonetheless, there is evidence to support increased airborne transmission of the latter 2 diseases under low outdoor air exchange conditions. 7, 15 Our results suggest that the risk of influenza infection for susceptible individuals entering outpatient consulting room A, although relatively low, are not negligible despite the fact that the total and outdoor air change rates meet guidelines recommended for patient examination rooms and general wards. 10 This further emphasizes the need to develop a rigorous scientific basis for prescribing minimum ventilation rates within a diverse range of hospital environments. 9 It is also noteworthy that natural ventilation can reduce airborne infection risk and energy consumption compared with mechanical ventilation, 26, 27 although this requires a climate amenable to this practice and appropriate planning of the hospital environment.While ventilation rates increased in outpatient consulting rooms A and B when doors were opened compared to when doors were closed, the increase was approximately 50% greater in consulting room A. Although not modeled, the risks to a susceptible individual entering room B thus would be greater than those shown in Figure 2B . Such room-specific idiosyncrasies underscore the potential pitfalls of generalizing results, even between 2 proximate and similar rooms. Notwithstanding this, the infection risk in both rooms could be further reduced by allowing their doors to remain open for longer periods after occupation by a potentially infectious individual. However, reducing the risk in one room occupied by a handful of individuals at the expense of increased risk in more densely occupied adjacent areas (eg, waiting room) would represent a false economy. The infectiousness of the pathogen, the air volume into which it would be mixed, and the number of susceptible persons located nearby would need to be carefully considered and balanced against existing risks before opening doors could be recommended as a general control strategy. Further research addressing this issue is needed.Certain locations within hospitals are likely to be airborne infection hot spots, especially those in which large numbers of untriaged individuals assemble. Beggs et al 23 estimated the risks of airborne transmission of TB, influenza, and measles in a hypothetical hospital waiting area containing a single infectious individual and found respective mean risks of infection for susceptible persons of 0.3%, 2.6%, and 13.5% for a 30-minute wait and 0.8%, 6.6%, and 30.9% for a 60-minute wait. Despite differences in methodology, the present study and that of Beggs et al 23 highlight the approximate relative risks faced by individuals during the time spent waiting for and during medical consultations. The risk of an individual acquiring influenza appears more likely during the actual consultation, if the room was previously occupied by an infectious individual, than during the period spent in a waiting room based on the limited scenarios modeled in the 2 studies.Infection risk modeling using the W-R or G-N model has several limitations that reflect the varying degrees to which its assumptions represent real-world conditions; these have been discussed in detail elsewhere. 19, 20, 23, 24 A key limitation is the reliance on quanta generation rates that have been calculated by a handful of previous epidemiologic investigations, although recent work suggests that this can be ameliorated somewhat by adopting a stochastic approach. 23 We sought to minimize this limitation by using values approximately representative of median cases reported in the literature. 5, 21 Nonetheless, it is prudent to view the output of infection risk models from a relative perspective. 23, 24, 26 Moreover, we did not assess risks posed to health care workers, 6,28 which are undoubtedly greater than those presented here, given these individuals' longer exposure times.In locations with suitably accurate ventilation control systems, it may be possible to infer outdoor air exchange for some rooms from known total air flow rates and outdoor air intake proportions, thus enabling calculation of real-time infection risk estimates when combined with occupancy at a given time. However, such an approach would need to be capable of representing air-exchange rates at the room rather than AHU scale, and would be appropriate only for locations in which air exchange from nonmechanical means (eg, infiltration) is small relative to that delivered mechanically. For greatest accuracy, a measurement-oriented approach should be used, even if only to validate the utility of the foregoing method.This study has built on previous work by estimating the airborne infection risk posed to individuals both simultaneous with and subsequent to the presence of an infectious person. Infection risk was found to vary considerably in the different locations assessed. A simple model provided useful information regarding relative infection risks and the role of room ventilation as a determinant. The risk of influenza infection in susceptible individuals entering an outpatient consultation room after the departure of an infectious person was related to the occupancy time of both parties and the outdoor air-exchange rate. Allowing the door to remain open for longer periods between consultations in the room that we investigated could reduce transmission risk by significantly increasing the air-exchange rate. However, such a basic infection control strategy cannot be recommended without an appropriately detailed assessment of its effects on infection risks in proximate areas.We have highlighted the utility of a customized approach that accounts for typical occupancy patterns of individuals at our study site. Ventilation measurements and modeling can be used to produce locationspecific risk estimates that err on the side of caution and inform airborne infection control and patient management practices. Such an approach may find increasing applications in the wake of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, and in locations dealing with particularly susceptible individuals.""}",Room ventilation and the risk of airborne infection transmission in 3 health care settings within a large teaching hospital,"BACKGROUND: Room ventilation is a key determinant of airborne disease transmission. Despite this, ventilation guidelines in hospitals are not founded on robust scientific evidence related to the prevention of airborne transmission. METHODS: We sought to assess the effect of ventilation rates on influenza, tuberculosis, and rhinovirus infection risk within 3 distinct rooms in a major urban hospital: a lung function laboratory, an emergency department negative-pressure isolation room, and an outpatient consultation room. Air-exchange rate measurements were performed in each room using CO(2) as a tracer. The model developed by Gammaitoni and Nucci was used to estimate infection risk. RESULTS: Current outdoor air-exchange rates in the lung function laboratory and emergency department isolation room limited infection risks to 0.1%-3.6%. Influenza risk for individuals entering an outpatient consultation room after an infectious individual departed ranged from 3.6% to 20.7%, depending on the duration for which each person occupied the room. CONCLUSION: Given the absence of definitive ventilation guidelines for hospitals, air-exchange measurements combined with modeling afford a useful means of assessing, on a case-by-case basis, the suitability of room ventilation for preventing airborne disease transmission.",10.1016/j.ajic.2011.02.014,Elsevier; Medline; PMC,PMC7115323,21658810.0,no-cc,2011-06-12,Am J Infect Control,,,,15000779.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2011.02.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655311001799; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655311001799; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21658810/,2011.0,paper

COVID-19 is a new beta coronavirus, which enters the cell via fusion with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [2] . The symptoms of COVID-19 are dependent on the age and the patient's underlying medical illness and also the condition of the immune system [3] . Chen and et al. reported that most of the infected patients suffer from an underlying disease including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus [4] . Coronaviruses can cause multiple systemic infections that respiratory complications are the most recognizable symptoms similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The most prevailing symptoms at the onset of disease, after an incubation period of approximately 5.2 days, are Fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea [5] . Some studies reported gastrointestinal complications, acute cardiac damage, and acute renal failure due to COVID-19 infection [6, 7] . Mao and et al evaluated neurological symptoms in 214 patients infected with COVID-19 (8) . Of 214 hos-pitalized patients, 36.4% had nervous system manifestations including dizziness, headache, hypogeusia, hyposmia, muscle damage, ischemic and hemorrhage stroke [8] . In our knowledge, up to now, no reported neuropathy and/or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) due to COVID-19 infection. GBS is an acute immunemediated disease of the peripheral nerves and nerve roots (polyradiculoneuropathy) that is usually elicited by various infections [9] . The classic clinical manifestations of GBS is progressive, ascending, symmetrical flaccid limbs paralysis, along with areflexia or hyporeflexia and with or without cranial nerve involvement, which can progress over the course of days to several weeks [9] . Two-thirds of patients usually report respiratory tract or gastrointestinal infection 2-4 weeks prior to the onset of neurological symptoms of GBS (10) . In this report, we describe GBS symptoms in one infected patient with COVID-19, for the first time."", ""Case presentation"": ""A 65-years-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department, with symptoms of acute progressive symmetric ascending quadriparesis. Neurological manifestations of the patient began with acute progressive weakness of distal lower extremities, five days before admission. At that time, the symptoms progressed from distal limbs to proximal limbs and he had https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2020.04.062 0967-5868/\u00d3 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. been quadriplegia one day before admission. There was facial paresis bilaterally. He had no urinary and fecal incontinence. Two weeks prior to hospitalization, the patient suffered from cough, fever and sometimes dyspnea. At that time, he referred to an infectious disease specialist and was diagnosed with COVID-19 after examining oropharyngeal sampling, and chest computer tomography (CT). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 was positive and the patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/RTV) and Azithromycin. In the past medical history, the patient was a well-known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus and was treated with metformin medication.On physical examination, the patient was afebrile with blood pressure 120/80 mm/hg, heart rate 73 beats/minute, respiratory rate 18/minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient was conscious and had no dyspnea, at the time of hospitalization. The muscle strength examination showed weakness in four limbs with a Medical Research Council (MRC) scale of 2/5 in proximal, 3/5 in distal of the upper extremities and 1/5 in proximal, 2/5 in distal of the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were absent generally. There was a reduction in the vibration and fine touch sensation distal to the ankle joints and also bifacial nerve palsy (House-Brackmann grade 3). He had no spine sensory level. Meningeal irritation signs and upper motor neuron disorder signs were negative. The laboratory examination results were follows: serum glucose 159 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen: 19 mg/dL; creatinine 0.8 mg/dL; alanine aminotransferase 35 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase 47 IU/L; sodium 135 mmol/L; potassium 3.9 mmol/L; white blood cell count 14,700 cells per microliter (neutrophils = 82.7%; lymphocytes = 10.4%); Erythrocyte sedimen-tation rate 72 mm/hour, C-reactive protein 2+, hemoglobin 11.6 g/ dL and negative glucose and ketone in complete urinalysis. Cervical and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done and showed a normal finding except for mild herniation of two intervertebral discs. Lung CT showed diffused consolidations and ground-glass opacities in both lungs, and bilateral pleural effusion (Fig. 1) . On day 9, the neurophysiological study was performed. Electro diagnostic parameters demonstrated decreased amplitude at compound muscle action potential and no response at sensory nerve action potential. Electromyography showed decreased recruitment. These findings are consistent with acute motorsensory axonal neuropathy (Table 1) . Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was not performed due to a lack of consent. Our patient received 0.40 g/kg/day intravenous Immunoglobulin for a duration of five days according to clinical manifestations related to GBS."", ""Discussion"": ""In this study, we reported Guillain Barre syndrome in a patient infected with COVID-19. COVID-19 is a beta coronavirus akin to SARS and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) such that, fever, cough, and difficulty breathing are the first symptoms that commonly were reported in infected patients with these viruses ( [11] . Neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection have been reported by Mao and et al. study [8] . The neurological manifestations had also reported in other beta coronavirus (SARS and MERS) that had been including polyneuropathy, myopathy, stroke and GBS [12] . To our knowledge, neuropathy and GBS have not been reported by infection with COVID-19, yet. Our patient had classic symptoms of GBS that had been begun approximately two weak after respiratory tract infection with COVID-19. For the reason that this patient had a preceding infection history, relative symmetric limbs weakness with a monophasic course, we suggested GBS variant as a possible diagnosis [9] . Electrodiagnostic findings confirmed this disorder. Studies on coronaviruses have been shown that these viruses have neurotrophic and neuroinvasive characteristics [11] . Although, these studied no performed about COVID-19 but the arrangement of SARS and MERS, especially SARS, are very similar to that of COVID-19 (11) . Both SARS and COVID-19 attach to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor [5, 11] . This receptor detected in the cell membrane of numerous human organs, including lung, kidney, liver, nervous system and skeletal muscle [8] . The mechanism of GBS formation in patients infected with COVID-19 has not yet been investigated. COVID-19 stimulates inflammatory cells and produces various inflammatory cytokines and as a result, it creates immune-mediated processes [5] . GBS is an immune-mediated disorder and molecular mimicry as a mechanism of autoimmune disorder plays an important role in creating it [10] . It is unclear whether COVID-19 induces the production of antibodies against specific gangliosides that usually appear with certain forms of GBS. Further investigations should be conducted about the mechanism of GBS in patients with COVID-19, in the future."", ""Conclusion"": ""In summary, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of GBS in a patient infected with COVID-19. Given that the most common symptoms of infection with COVID-19 were reported respiratory infections and two-thirds of Guillain-Barre patients usually mention respiratory infections before the onset of symptoms, hence GBS should be considered as neurological complications of infection with COVID-19. Therapy with IVIG or plasmapheresis should be initiated along with antiviral treatment."", ""Funding"": ""The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."", ""Declaration of Competing Interest"": ""The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.""}",Guillain Barre syndrome associated with COVID-19 infection: A case report,"Novel outbreak with coronavirus 2019 began since 31 December 2019.

The synthesis algorithm for LTL[F] seeks systems with a highest possible satisfaction value. One can consider either a worst-case approach, where the satisfaction value of a system is the satisfaction value of its computation with the lowest satisfaction value [1] , or a stochastic approach, where it is the expected satisfaction value, given a distribution of the inputs [2] .Consider, for example, an acceleration controller of an autonomous car. Normally, the car should maintain a relatively constant speed. However, in order to optimize travel time, if a long stretch of road is visible and is identified as low-risk, the car should accelerate. Conversely, if an obstacle or some risk factor is identified, the car should decelerate. Clearly, the car cannot accelerate and decelerate at the same time. We capture this desired behavior with the following LTL[F] formula over the inputs {safe, obs} and outputs {acc, dec}: \u03c8 = G(safe \u2192 (acc \u2295 2 3 Xacc)) \u2227 G(obs \u2192 (dec \u2295 3 4 Xdec)) \u2227 G(\u00ac(acc \u2227 dec)). Thus, in order to get satisfaction value 1, each detection of a safe stretch should be followed by an acceleration during two transactions, with a preference to the first (by the semantics of the weighted average \u2295 \u03bb operator, the satisfaction value of safe \u2192 (acc \u2295 2 3 Xacc) is 1 when safe is followed by two accs, 2 3 when it is followed by one acc, and 1 3 if it is followed by one acc with a delay), and each detection of an obstacle should be followed by a deceleration during two transactions, with a (higher) preference to the first. Clearly, \u03c8 is not realizable with satisfaction value 1, as for some input sequences, namely those with simultaneous or successive occurrences of safe and obs, it is impossible to respond with the desired patterns of acceleration or declaration. Existing frameworks for synthesis cannot handle this challenge. Indeed, we do not want to add an assumption about safe and obs occurring far apart. Rather, we want our autonomous car to behave in an optimal way also in problematic environments, and we want, when we evaluate the quality of a car, to take into an account the challenge posed by the environment. This is exactly what high-quality ge-synthesis does: for each input sequence, it requires the synthesized car to obtain the maximal satisfaction value that is possible for that input sequence.We show that in the Boolean setting, ge-synthesis can be reduced to synthesis of LTL with quantification of atomic propositions [26] . Essentially, ge-synthesis of \u03c8 amounts to synthesis of (\u2203O.\u03c8) \u2192 \u03c8. We show that by carefully switching between nondeterminisitc and universal automata, we can solve the ge-synthesis problem in doubly-exponential time, thus it is not harder than traditional synthesis. Also, our algorithm is Safraless, thus no determinization and parity games are needed [15, 17] .A drawback of ge-synthesis is that we do not actually know whether the specification is satisfied. We describe two ways to address this drawback. The first goes beyond providing satisfaction information and enables the designer to partition the specification into a strong component, which is guaranteed to be satisfied in all environments, and a weak component, which is guaranteed to be satisfied only in hopeful ones. The second way augments ge-realizing systems by \""satisfaction indicators\"". For example, we show that when a system is lucky to interact with an environment that generates a prefix of an input sequence such that, when combined with a suitable prefix of an output sequence, the specification becomes realizable, then ge-synthesis guarantees that the system indeed responds with a suitable prefix of an output sequence. Moreover, it is easy to add to the system a monitor that detects such prefixes, thus indicating that the specification is going to be satisfied in all environments. Additional monitors we suggest detect prefixes after which the satisfaction becomes valid or unsatisfiable.We continue to the quantitative setting. We parameterize hope by a satisfaction value v \u2208 [0, 1] and say that an input sequence x \u2208 (2 I ) \u03c9 is v-hopeful for an LTL[F] formula \u03c8 if an interaction with it can generate a computation that satisfies \u03c8 with value at least v. Formally, there is an output sequence y \u2208 (2 O ) \u03c9 such that [[x \u2297 y, \u03c8] ] \u2265 v, where for a computation w \u2208 (2 I\u222aO ) \u03c9 , we use [[w, \u03c8] ] to denotes the satisfaction value of \u03c8 in w. As we elaborate below, while the basic idea of ge-synthesis, namely \""input sequences with a potential to high quality should realize this potential\"" is as in the Boolean setting, there are several ways to implement this idea.We start with a worst-case approach. There, a strategy f :The requirement can be applied to a threshold value or to all values v \u2208 [0, 1]. For example, our autonomous car controller has to achieve satisfaction value 1 in roads with no simultaneous or successive occurrences of safe and obs, and value 3 4 in roads that violate the latter only with some obs followed by safe. We then argue that the situation is similar to that of high-quality assume guarantee synthesis [3] , where richer relations between a quantitative assumption and a quantitative guarantee are of interest. In our case, the assumption is the hopefulness level of the input sequence, namely [[x, \u2203O.\u03c8]], and the guarantee is the satisfaction value of the specification in the generated computation, namely [[x \u2297 f (x), \u03c8]]. When synthesizing, for example, a robot controller (e.g., vacuum cleaner) in a building, the doors to rooms are controlled by the environment, whereas the movement of the robot by the system. A measure of the performance of the robot has to take into an account both the number of \""hopeful rooms\"", namely these with an open door -a projection of this number on [0, 1] serves as the assumption, and the number of room cleaned -which induces the guarantee. We assume that the desired relation between the assumption and the guarantee is given by a function comb : [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1], which can capture implication, difference, or ratio.We continue with an analysis of the expected performance of the system. We do so by assuming a stochastic environment, with a known distribution on the input sequences. We introduce and study two measures for high-quality gesynthesis in a stochastic environment. In the first, termed expected ge-synthesis, all input sequences are sampled, yet the satisfaction value in each input sequence takes its hopefulness level into account, for example by a comb function as in the assume-guarantee setting. In the second, termed conditional expected ge-synthesis, only hopeful input sequences are sampled. For both approaches, our synthesis algorithm is based on the high-quality LTL[F] synthesis algorithm of [2] , which is based on an analysis of deterministic automata associated with the different satisfaction values of the LTL[F] specification. Here too, the complexity stays doubly exponential. In addition, we extend the synthesized systems with guarantees for satisfaction and monitors indicating satisfaction in various satisfaction levels."", ""Preliminaries"": ""Consider two finite sets I and O of input and output signals, respectively. For two words x = i 0 \u00b7 i 1 \u00b7 i 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2208 (2 I ) \u03c9 and y = o 0 \u00b7 o 1 \u00b7 o 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2208 (2 I ) \u03c9 , we define x \u2297 y as the word in (2 I\u222aO ) \u03c9 obtained by merging x and y. Thus,The definition is similar for finite x and y of the same length. For a word w \u2208 (2 I\u222aO ) \u03c9 , we use w |I to denote the projection of w on I. In particular, (x \u2297 y) |I = x.A strategy is a function f : (2 I ) + \u2192 2 O . Intuitively, f models the interaction of a system that generates in each moment in time a letter in 2 O with an environment that generates letters in 2 I . For an input sequenceNote that the environment initiates the interaction, by inputting i 0 . Of special interest are finite-state strategies, induced by finite state transducers. Formally, an I/O-transducer is T = I, O, S, s 0 , M, \u03c4 , where S is a finite set of states, s 0 \u2208 S is an initial state, M : S \u00d7 2 I \u2192 S is a transition function, and \u03c4 : S \u2192 2 O is a labelling function. For x = i 0 \u00b7 i 1 \u00b7 i 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2208 (2 I ) * , let M * (x) be the state in S that T reaches after reading x. Thus is, M * ( ) = s 0 and for every j \u2265 0, we have thatWe use T (x) and x \u2297 T (x) to denote the output sequence and the computation of T on x, respectively, and talk about T realizing a specification, referring to the strategy f T .We specify on-going behaviors of reactive systems using the linear temporal logic LTL [19] . Formulas of LTL are constructed from a set AP of atomic proposition using the usual Boolean operators and temporal operators like G (\""always\""), F (\""eventually\""), X (\""next time\""), and U (\""until\""). Each LTL formula \u03c8 defines a language L(\u03c8) = {w : w |= \u03c8} \u2286 (2 AP ) \u03c9 . We also use automata on infinite words for specifying and reasoning about on-going behaviors. We use automata with different branching modes (nondeterministic, where some run has to be accepting; universal, where all runs have to be accepting; and deterministic, where there is a single run) and different acceptance conditions (B\u00fcchi, co-B\u00fcchi, and parity). We use the three letter acronyms NBW, UCW, DPW, and DFW, to refer to nondeterministic B\u00fcchi, universal co-B\u00fcchi, deterministic parity, and deterministic finite word automata, respectively. Given an LTL formula \u03c8 over AP , one can constructs an NBW A \u03c8 with at most 2 O(|\u03c8|) states such that L(A \u03c8 ) = L(\u03c8) [27] . Constructing an NBW for \u00ac\u03c8 and then dualizing it, results in a UCW for L(\u03c8), also with at most 2 O(|\u03c8|) states. Determinization [23] then leads to a DPW for L(\u03c8) with at at most 2 2 O(|\u03c8|) states and index 2 O(|\u03c8|) . For full definitions of LTL, automata, and their relation, see [12] .Consider an LTL formula \u03c8 over I \u222a O. We say that \u03c8 is realizable if there is a finite-state strategy f :That is, the computation of f on every input sequence satisfies \u03c8. We say that a word x \u2208 (2 I ) \u03c9 is hopeful for \u03c8 if there is y \u2208 (2 O ) \u03c9 such that x\u2297y |= \u03c8. Then, we say that \u03c8 is good-enough realizable (ge-realizable, for short) if there is a finite-state strategy f : (2 I ) + \u2192 2 O such that for every x \u2208 (2 I ) \u03c9 that is hopeful for \u03c8, we have that x \u2297 f (x) |= \u03c8. That is, if there is some output sequence whose combination with x satisfies \u03c8, then the computation of f on x satisfies \u03c8. The LTL ge-synthesis problem is then to decide whether a given LTL formula is ge-realizable, and if so, to return a transducer that ge-realizes it. Clearly, every realizable specification is ge-realizable -by the same transducer. We say that \u03c8 is universally satisfiable if all input sequences are hopeful for \u03c8. It is easy to see that for universally satisfiable specifications, realizability and ge-realizability coincide. On the other hand, as demonstrated in Sect. 1, there are specifications that are not realizable and are ge-realizable.Clearly, \u03c8 is not realizable, as an input sequence x \u2208 (2 I ) \u03c9 is hopeful for \u03c8 iff x |= GFp \u2227 GF\u00acp. Since the system has to assign a value to q before it knowns the value of Xp, it seems that \u03c8 is also not ge-realizable. As we show below, however, the specification \u03c8 is ge-realizable. Intuitively, it follows from the fact that hopeful input sequences consists of alternating p-blocks and (\u00acp)-blocks. Then, by outputting \u00acq in p-blocks and outputting q in (\u00acp)-blocks, the system guarantees that each last position in a (\u00acp)-block satisfies q \u2227 Xp and each last position in a p-block satisfies (\u00acq)\u2227Xp. "", ""LTL Good-Enough Synthesis"": ""Recall that a strategy f : (2 I ) + \u2192 2 O ge-realizes an LTL formula \u03c8 if its computations on all hopeful input sequences satisfy \u03c8. Thus, for every input sequence x \u2208 (2 I ) \u03c9 , either x\u2297y |= \u03c8 for all y \u2208 (2 O ) \u03c9 , or x\u2297f (x) |= \u03c8. The above suggests that algorithms for solving LTL ge-synthesis involve existential and universal quantification over the behavior of output signals. The logic EQLTL extends LTL by allowing existential quantification over atomic propositions [26] . We refer here to the case the atomic propositions are the signals in I \u222a O, and the signals in O are existentially quantified. Then, an EQLTL formula is of the form \u2203O.\u03c8, and a computation w \u2208 (2 I\u222aO ) \u03c9 satisfies \u2203O.\u03c8 iff there is y \u2208 (2 O ) \u03c9 such that w |I \u2297 y |= \u03c8. Dually, AQLTL extends LTL by allowing universal quantification over atomic propositions. We consider here formulas of the form \u2200O.\u03c8, which are equivalent to \u00ac\u2203O.\u00ac\u03c8. Indeed, a computation w \u2208 (2 I\u222aO ) \u03c9 satisfies \u2200O.\u03c8 iff for all y \u2208 (2 O ) \u03c9 , we have that w |I \u2297 y |= \u03c8. Note that in both the existential and universal cases, the O-component of w is ignored. Accordingly, we sometimes interpret EQLTL and AQLTL formulas with respect to input sequences x \u2208 (2 I ) \u03c9 . Also note that both EQLTL and AQLTL increase the expressive power of LTL. For example, the EQLTL formula \u2203q.q \u2227 X\u00acq \u2227 G(q \u2194 XXq) \u2227 G(q \u2192 p) states that p holds in all even positions of the computation, which cannot be specified in LTL [29] .Proof. We start with the upper bound. Given an LTL formula \u03c8 over I \u222a O, we describe an algorithm that returns a transducer T that ge-realizes \u03c8, or declares that no such transducer exists.It is not hard to see that T ge-realizes \u03c8 iff T realizes \u03d5 = \u03c8 \u2228 \u2200O.\u00ac\u03c8. Indeed, an input sequence x \u2208 (2 I ) \u03c9 is hopeful for \u03c8 iff x |= \u2203O.\u03c8, and so the specification \u03d5 requires all hopeful input sequences to satisfy \u03c8. A naive construction of an NBW for \u03d5 involves a universal projection of the signals in O in an automaton for \u00ac\u03c8, and results in an NBW that is doubly exponential.In order to circumvent the extra exponent, we construct an NBW A \u00ac\u03d5 for \u00ac\u03d5, and then dualize it to get a UCW for \u03d5, as follows.Let A \u00ac\u03c8 be an NBW for L(\u00ac\u03c8) and A \u2203O.\u03c8 be an NBW for L(\u2203O.\u03c8). Thus, A \u2203O.\u03c8 is obtained from an NBW A \u03c8 for L(\u03c8) by existentially projecting its transitions on 2 I . In more details, ifLet A \u00ac\u03d5 be an NBW for the intersection of A \u00ac\u03c8 and A \u2203O.\u03c8 . We can define A \u00ac\u03d5 as the product of A \u00ac\u03c8 and A \u2203O.\u03c8 , possibly using the generalized B\u00fcchi acceptance condition (see Remark 1), thus its size is exponential in \u03c8. The language of A \u00ac\u03d5 is then {w \u2208 (2 I\u222aO ) \u03c9 : w |= \u03c8 and w |= \u2203O.\u03c8}. We then solve usual synthesis for the complementing UCW. Its language is {w \u2208 (2 I\u222aO ) \u03c9 : w |= \u03c8 or w |= \u2200O.\u00ac\u03c8}, as required. By [17] , the synthesis problem for UCW can be solved in EXPTIME, and we are done.The lower bound follows from the 2EXPTIME-hardness of LTL realizability [22] . The hardness proof there constructs, given a 2EXPTIME Turing machine M , an LTL formula \u03c8 that is realizable iff M accepts the empty tape. Since all input sequences are hopeful for \u03c8, realizability and ge-realizability coincide, and we are done.Note that working with a UCW not only handles the universal quantification for free but also has the advantage of a Safraless synthesis algorithm -no determinization and parity games are needed [15, 17] . Also note that the algorithm we suggest in the proof of Theorem 1 can be generalized to handle specifications that are arbitrary positive Boolean combinations of EQLTL formulas."", ""Remark 1 [Products and optimizations]."": ""Throughout the paper, we construct products of automata whose state space is 2 cl(\u03c8) , and states correspond to maximal consistent subsets of cl(\u03c8), possibly in the scope of an existential quantifier of O. Accordingly, the product can be minimized to include only consistent pairs. Also, since traditional-synthesis algorithms, in particular the Safraless algorithms we use, can handle automata with generalized B\u00fcchi and co-B\u00fcchi acceptance condition, we need only one copy of the product.Remark 2 [Determinancy of the ge-synthesis game]. Determinancy of games implies that in traditional synthesis, a specification \u03c8 is not I/O-realizable iff \u00ac\u03c8 is O/I-realizable This is useful, for example when we want to synthesize a transducer of a bounded size and proceed simultaneously, aiming to synthesize either a system transducer that realizes \u03c8 or an environment transducer that realizes \u00ac\u03c8 [17] . For ge-synthesis, simple dualization does not hold, but we do have determinancy in the sense that (\u2203O.\u03c8)Accordingly, \u03c8 is not ge-realizable iff the environment has a strategy that generates, for each output sequence y \u2208 (2 O ) \u03c9 , a helpful input sequence x \u2208 (2 I ) \u03c9 such that x \u2297 y |= \u00ac\u03c8. In the full version, we formalize and study this duality further."", ""Guarantees in Good-Enough Synthesis"": ""A drawback of ge-synthesis is that we do not actually know whether the specification is satisfied. In this section we describe two ways to address this drawback. The first way goes beyond providing satisfaction information and enables the designer to partition the specification into to a strong component, which should be satisfied in all environments, and a weak component, which should be satisfied only in hopeful ones. The second way augments ge-realizing transducers by flags, raised to indicate the status of the satisfaction."", ""ge-Synthesis with a Guarantee"": ""Recall that ge-realizability is suitable especially in settings where we design a system that has to do its best in all environments. ge-synthesis with a guarantee is suitable in settings where we want to make sure that some components of the specification are satisfied in all environment. Accordingly, a specification is an LTL formula \u03c8 = \u03c8 strong \u2227 \u03c8 weak . When we ge-synthesize \u03c8 weak with guarantee \u03c8 strong , we seek a transducer T that realizes \u03c8 strong and ge-realizes \u03c8 weak . Thus, for all input sequencesTheorem 2. The LTL ge-synthesis with guarantee problem is 2EXPTIMEcomplete.Proof. Consider an LTL formula \u03c8 = \u03c8 strong \u2227 \u03c8 weak over I \u222a O.

We can then construct a UCW A \u03d5 for L(\u03d5) by dualizing an NBW for its negation \u00ac\u03c8 strong \u2228 ((\u2203O.\u03c8 weak ) \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8 weak ), which can be constructed using techniques similar to those in the proof of Theorem 1. We then proceed with standard synthesis for A \u03d5 . Note that the approach is Safraless. Taking an empty (that is, True) guarantee, a lower bound follows from the 2EXPTIME-hardness of LTL ge-synthesis."", ""Flags by a ge-Realizing Transducer"": ""For a language L \u2286 (2 I\u222aO ) \u03c9 and a finite wordThat is, L w is the language of suffixes of words in L that have w as a prefix. We say that a word w \u2208x \u2297 y is green for L. When a system is lucky to interact with an environment that generates a green input sequence, we want the system to react in a way that generates a green prefix, and then realizes the specification. Formally, we say that a strategy f :It is not hard to see that for ge-realizable languages, green and light green coincide. Indeed, if L is universally satisfiable and ge-realizable, then L is realizable. Theorem 3. ge-realizability is strictly stronger than green realizability.Proof. We first prove that every strategy f : (2 I ) + \u2192 2 O that ge-realizes a specification \u03c8 also green realizes \u03c8. Consider x \u2208 (2 I ) + that is green for \u03c8. By definition, there is y \u2208 (2 O ) + such that L x\u2297y is realizable. Then, for everyis green, and so f green realizes \u03c8.We continue and describe a specification that is green realizable and not gerealizable. Let I = {p} and O = {q}. Consider the specification \u03c8 = G((Xp) \u2194 q). Clearly, \u03c8 is not realizable, as the system has to commit a value for q before a value for Xp is known. Likewise, no word w \u2208 (2 I\u222aO ) * is green for \u03c8, and so no finite input sequence x \u2208 (2 I ) * is green for \u03c8. Hence, every strategy (vacuously) green realizes \u03c8. On the other hand, for every input sequences x \u2208 (2 I ) \u03c9 there is an output sequence y \u2208 (2 O ) \u03c9 such that x \u2297 y |= \u03c8. Thus, all input sequences are hopeful for \u03c8. Thus, synthesis and ge-synthesis coincide for \u03c8, which is not ge-realizable.Theorem 3 brings with it two good news. The first is that a ge-realizing transducer has the desired property of being also green realizing. The second has to do with our goal of providing the user with information about the satisfaction status, in particular raising a green flag whenever a green prefix is detected. By Theorem 3, such a flag indicates that the computation generated by our ge-realizing transducer satisfies the specification. A naive way to detect green prefixes for a specification \u03c8 is to solve the synthesis problem for \u03c8 by solving a game on top of a DPW D \u03c8 for \u03c8. The winning positions in the game are states in D \u03c8 . By defining them as accepting states, we can obtain from D \u03c8 a DFW for green prefixes. Then, we run this DFW in parallel with the ge-realizing transducer, and raise the green flag whenever a green prefix is detected. This, however, requires a generation of D \u03c8 and a solution of parity games. Below we describe a much simpler way, which makes use of the fact that our transducer ge-realizes the specification.Recall that if L is universally satisfiable and ge-realizable, then L is realizable. Accordingly, given a transducer T that ge-realizes \u03c8, we can augment it with green flags by running in parallel a DFW that detects light-green prefixes. As we argue below, constructing such a DFW only requires an application of the subset construction on top of an NBW for the existential projection of \u03c8 on 2 I ."", ""Lemma 1. Given an LTL formula \u03c8 over"": ""Proof. Let A \u03c8 = 2 I\u222aO , Q, \u03b4, Q 0 , \u03b1 be an NBW for L(\u03c8), and let B \u03c8 = 2 I , Q, \u03b4 , Q 0 , \u03b1 be its existential projection on 2 I . Thus, for every q \u2208 Q and i \u2208 2 I , wewhere M follows the subset construction of B \u03c8 : for every S \u2208 2 Q and i \u2208 2 I , we have M (S, i) = s\u2208S \u03b4 (s, i). Then, F = {S \u2208 2 Q : L(B S \u03c8 ) = (2 I ) \u03c9 }. Observe that S rejects x \u2208 (2 I ) * iff there is x \u2208 (2 I ) \u03c9 such that for all y \u2208 (2 O ) * and y \u2208 (2 O ) \u03c9 , no state in \u03b4(Q 0 , x \u2297 y) accepts x \u2297 y . Thus, S rejects x iff x is not light green, and accepts it otherwise. Note that the definition of F involves universality checking, possibly via complementation, yet no determinization is required, and the size of S is 2 2 O(|\u03c8|) .Note that once we reach an accepting state in S, we can make it an accepting loop. Indeed, once a green prefix is detected, then all prefixes that extend it are green. Accordingly, once the green flag is raised, it stays up. Also note that if an input sequence is not hopeful for \u03c8, then none of its prefixes is light green for \u03c8. The converse, however, is not true: an input sequence may be hopeful and still have no light green prefixes. For example, taking I = {p}, the input sequence {p} \u03c9 is hopeful for Gp, yet none of its prefixes is green light, as it can be extended to an input sequence with \u00acp.Green flags provide information about satisfaction. Two additional flags of interest are related to safety and co-safety properties:for all y \u2208 (2 O ) * , we have that x \u2297 y is red for L. Thus, when the environment generates x, then no matter how the system responds, L is not satisfied.-a word w \u2208 (2 I\u222aO ) * is blue for L when L w = (2 I\u222aO ) \u03c9 , and then define a word x \u2208 (2 I ) * as blue for L if there is y \u2208 (2 O ) * such that x \u2297 y is blue for L. Thus, when the environment generates x, the system can respond in a way that guarantees satisfaction no matter how the interaction continues.A monitor that detects red and blue prefixes for L can be added to a transducer that ge-realizes L. As has been the case with the monitor for green prefixes, its construction is based on applying the subset construction on an NBW for L [16] . Also, once a red or blue flag is raised, it stays up. In a way analogous to green realizability, we seek a transducer that ge-realizes the specification and generates a red prefix only if all interactions generate a red prefix, and generates a blue prefix whenever this is possible. In the full version, we show that while ge-realization implies red realization, it may conflict with blue realization."", ""High-Quality Good-Enough Synthesis"": ""ge-synthesis is of special interest when the satisfaction value of the specification is multi-valued, and we want to synthesize high-quality systems.

In Sect. 5.3 below we study additional ways to refer to hopefulness levels."", ""LTL[F ] Assume-Guarantee ge-Synthesis"": ""In Sect. 5 [3] . There, the specification consists of a multi-valued assumption A, which in our case is \u2203O.\u03c8, and a multi-valued guarantee G, which is our case is \u03c8.There The choice of an appropriate comb function depends on the setting. Implication is in order when harsh environments may outweigh the actual performance of the system. For example, if our specification measures the uptime of a server in a cluster, then environments that cause very frequent power failures render the server unusable, as the overhead of reconnecting it outweighs its usefulness. In such a case, being shut down is better than continuously trying to reconnect, and so we give a higher satisfaction value for the server being down, which depends only on the environment. Then, as demonstrated with the cleaning robot in Sect. 1, the difference and ratio functions are fairly natural when measuring \""realization of potential\"". We now describe a more detailed example when these measures are in order.Example 3. Consider a controller for an elevator in an n-floor building. The environment sends to the controller requests, by means of a truth assignment to I = {1, . . . , n}, indicating the subset of floors in which the elevator is requested. Then, the controller assigns values to O = {up, down}, directing the elevator to go up, go down, or stay. The satisfaction value of the specification \u03c8 reflects the waiting time of the request with the slowest response: it is 0 when this time is more than 2n, and is 1 when the slowest request is granted immediately. Sure enough, there is no controller that attains satisfaction value 1 on all input sequences, and so \u03c8 is not realizable with satisfaction value 1. Also, adding assumptions about the behavior of the environment is not of much interest. Using AG ge-realizability, we can synthesize a controller that behaves in an optimal way. For example, using the difference function, we measure the performance of the controller on an input sequence x \u2208 (2 I ) \u03c9 with respect to the best possible performance on x. Note that such a best performance needs a look-ahead on requests yet to come, which is indeed the satisfaction value of \u2203O.\u03c8 in x. Thus, the assumption [[x, \u2203O.\u03c8]] actually gives us the performance of a good-enough off-line controller. Accordingly, using the ratio function, we can synthesize a system with the best competitive ratio for an on-line interaction [7] .Given an LTL[F] formula \u03c8 and a function comb, we define the ge-AGrealization value of \u03c8 in a transducer T by min{comb(x \u2208 (2 I ) \u03c9 }.

By definition, AG ge-realization of \u03c8 with value v coincides with realization of the lan- \u2265 v 2 }, and proceed to construct an NBW for L v by taking the union of NBWs A v1,v2 for all v 1 , v 2 \u2208 G v , each of which is the product of NBWs A \u2264v1 \u2203O.\u03c8 and A \u2265v2 \u03c8 , as in the proof of Theorem 5. Aiming to proceed Safralessly, we can also construct a UCW for L v , as follows. First, note that by the monotonicity of comb, for every v 1 we can obtain a UCW for L v by dualizing an NBW that is the union of NBWs A u1,u2 , for all u 1 , u 2 \u2208 V (\u03c8) \u00d7 V (\u03c8) \\ G v , each of which is the product of NBWs A \u2265u1 \u2203O.\u03c8 and A \u2264u2 \u03c8 . Observe that in all cases, the size of the NBW is 2 O(|\u03c8|) . Indeed, there are at most 2 2|\u03c8| pairs in the union, and, by Theorem 4, the size of the NBW for each pair is 2 O(|\u03c8|) .The lower bound follows from the 2EXPTIME-hardness of LTL gerealizability.By Theorem 4, the number of possible satisfaction values for \u03c8 is at most 2 |\u03c8| . Thus, the number of possible values for comb (A, G) , where A and G are satisfaction values of \u03c8, is at most 2 2|\u03c8| . Using binary search over the image of comb, we can use Theorem 7 to obtain the following. However, the solution described in Sect. 5.2 is simpler than the one described here for the general case."", ""LTL[F ] ge-Synthesis in Stochastic Environments"": ""The setting of LTL[F] ge-synthesis studied in Sects. 5.2 and 5.3 takes the different satisfaction values into an account, but is binary, in the sense that a specification is either (possibly AG) ge-realizable, or is not. In particular, in case the specification is not ge-realizable, synthesis algorithms only return \""no\"". In this section we add a quantitative measure also to the underlying realizability question. We do so by assuming a stochastic environment, with a known distribution on the inputs sequences, and analyzing the expected performance of the system.For completeness, we remind the reader of some basics of probability theory. For a comprehensive reference see e.g., [25] . Let \u03a3 be a finite alphabet, and let \u03bd be some probability distribution over \u03a3 \u03c9 . For example, in the uniform distribution over (2 I ) \u03c9 , the probability space is induced by sampling each letter with probability 2 \u2212|I| , corresponding to settings in which each signal in I always holds in probability 1 2 . We assume \u03bd is given by a finite Markov Decision Process (MDP). That is, \u03bd is induced by the distribution of each letter i \u2208 2 I at each time step, determined by a finite stochastic control process that takes into account also the outputs generated by the system (see [2] for the precise model). A random variable is then a function X : \u03a3 \u03c9 \u2192 R. When X has a finite image V , which is the case in our setting, its expected value is E[X] = v\u2208V v \u00b7 Pr(X \u22121 (v)). Intuitively, E[X] is the \""average\"" value that X attains. Next, consider an eventPr(E) , where 1 E X is the random variable that assigns X(w) to w \u2208 E and 0 to w \u2208 E. Intuitively, E[X|E] is the average value that X attains when restricting to words in E, and normalizing according to the probability of E itself.We continue and review the high-quality synthesis problem [2] , where the ge variant is not considered. There, the environment is assumed to be stochastic and we care for the expected satisfaction value of an LTL[F] specification in the computations of a transducer T , assuming some given distribution on the inputs sequences. Formally, let X T ,\u03c8 : (2 I ) \u03c9 \u2192 R be a random variable that assigns each sequence x \u2208 (2 I ) \u03c9 of input signals with [[T (x) , \u03c8]]. Then, when the sequences in (2 I ) \u03c9 are sampled according to a given distribution \u03bd of (2 I ) \u03c9 , we define [[T , \u03c8]] \u03bd = E[X T ,\u03c8 ]. Since \u03bd is fixed, we omit it from the notation and use [[T , \u03c8] ] in the following."", ""Remark 6 [Relating LTL ge-synthesis with stochastic LTL[F] synthesis]"": ""Given an LTL formula \u03c8, we can view it as an LTL[F] formula with possible satisfaction values {0, 1}, apply to it high-quality synthesis a-la [2] , and find a transducer T that maximizes E[X T ,\u03c8 ]. An interesting observation is that if T ge-realizes \u03c8, then it also maximizes E[X T ,\u03c8 ]. Indeed, all input sequences that can contribute to the expected satisfaction value, do so.We introduce and study two measures for high-quality synthesis in a stochastic environment. In the first, termed expected ge-synthesis, all input sequences are sampled, yet the satisfaction value in each input sequence takes its hopefulness level into account. In the second, termed conditional expected ge-synthesis, only hopeful input sequences are sampled.We start with expected ge-synthesis. There, instead of associating each In [2] , it is shown that the high-quality synthesis problem can be solved in doubly-exponential time, also in the presence of environment assumptions. In the solution, the first step is the translation of the involved formulas to DPWs. In order to extract from [2] the results relevant to us, we describe them by means of discrete quantitative specifications, defined as follows. A discrete quantitative specification \u03a8 over I \u222a O is given by means of a sequence A 1 , . . . , A n of DPWs, with (2 I\u222aO "", ""Guarantees in High-Quality ge-Synthesis"": ""As in the Boolean setting, also in the high-quality one we would like to add to a ge-realizing transducer guarantees and indications about the satisfaction level. As we detail below, the quantitative setting offers many possible ways to do so.High-Quality ge-Synthesis with Guarantees. We consider specifications of the form \u03c8 = \u03c8 strong \u2227\u03c8 weak , where essentially, we seek a transducer that realizes \u03c8 strong and (possibly AG) ge-realizes \u03c8 weak . Maximizing the realization value of \u03c8 strong may conflict with maximizing the ge-realization value of \u03c8 weak , and there are different ways to trade-off the two goals. Technically, in the decision-problem variant, we are given two thresholds v 1 , v 2 \u2208 [0, 1], and we seek a transducer T that realizes \u03c8 strong with value at least v 1 , and ge-realizes \u03c8 weak with value at least v 2 . Then, one may start, for example, by maximizing the value v 1 , and then find the maximal value v 2 that may be achieved simultaneously. Alternatively, one may prefer to maximize v 2 , or some other combination of v 1 and v 2 . Also, it is possible to decompose \u03c8 further, to several strong and weak components, each with its desired threshold.The solutions in the different settings all involve a construction of a UCW A \u2265v1 \u03c8strong , and its product with the automata constructed in the solutions for the different ge-synthesis variants. We thus have the following. We note that when the solution for \u03c8 weak is Safraless, we can use a UCW for \u03c8 strong to maintain a Safraless construction."", ""Theorem 10. The problem of LTL[F]"": ""high-quality ge-synthesis with a guarantee can be solved in doubly-exponential time.Flags by a High-Quality ge-Realizing Transducer. In the quantitative setting, we parameterized the flags raised by the ge-realizing transducer by values in [0, 1], indicating the announced satisfaction level. Thus, rather than talking about prefixes being green, red, or blue, we talk about them being vgreen, v-red, and v-blue, for v \u2208 [0, 1], which essentially means that a satisfaction value of at least v is guarantees (in green and blue flags) or is impossible (in red ones). We can think of those as \""degrees\"" of green, red, and blue. Below, we formalize this intuition and argue that even an augmentation of a transducer that ge-realizes \u03c8 by flags for all values in V (\u03c8) leaves the problem in doublyexponential time.A quantitative language over 2 I\u222aO is L : (2 I\u222aO ) \u03c9 \u2192 [0, 1]. For a quantitative language L and a word w \u2208 (2 I\u222aO ) * , we define L w as the quantitative language where for all w \u2208 (2 I\u222aO ) \u03c9 , we have L w (w ) = L(w \u00b7 w ). For a value v \u2208 [0, 1], a word w \u2208 (2 I\u222aO ) * is v-green for L if L w is v-realizable. That is, there is a transducer T such that [[T, L w ]] \u2265 v. A word x \u2208 (2 I ) * is v-green for L if there is y \u2208 (2 O ) * such that x\u2297y is v-green for L. Thus, when the environment generates x, the system can respond in a way that would guarantee v-realizability. Finally, we say that L is green realizable if there is a strategy f : (2 I ) + \u2192 2 O that for every threshold v and for every input x \u2208 (2 I ) + that is v-green for L, we have that x \u2297 f (x) is v-green for L. It is not hard to see that Theorem 3 carries over to the quantitative setting, thus quantitative optimal realizability is strictly stronger than quantitative green realizability. In particular, if a transducer T optimally realizes an LTL[F] formula \u03c8, then T also green realizes \u03c8. In the full version, we describe quantitative definitions also for red and blue prefixes, and describe monitors for the detection of the various types of prefixes."", ""Discussion"": ""We introduced and solved several variants of ge-synthesis. Our complexity results are tight and show that ge-synthesis is not more complex than traditional synthesis. In practice, however, traditional synthesis algorithms do not scale well, and much research is devoted for the development of methods and heuristics for coping with the implementation challenges of synthesis. A natural future research direction is to extend these heuristics and methods for gesynthesis. We mention here two specific examples.Efficient synthesis algorithms have been developed for fragments of LTL [21] . Most notable is the GR(1) fragment [18] , which supports assume-guarantee reasoning, and for which synthesis has an efficient symbolic solution. Adding existential quantification to GR(1) specifications, which is how we handled LTL ge-synthesis, is not handled by its known algorithms, and is an interesting challenge. The success of SAT-based model-checking have led to the development of SAT-based synthesis algorithms [6] , where the synthesis problem is reduced to satisfiability of a QBF formula. The fact the setting already includes quantifiers suggests it can be extended to ge-synthesis. A related effort is bounded synthesis algorithms [13, 24] , where the synthesized systems are assumed to be of a bounded size and can be represented symbolically [10] .""}",Good-Enough Synthesis,"We introduce and study good-enough synthesis (ge-synthesis) – a variant of synthesis in which the system is required to satisfy a given specification [Formula: see text] only when it interacts with an environments for which a satisfying interaction exists. Formally, an input sequence x is hopeful if there exists some output sequence y such that the induced computation [Formula: see text] satisfies [Formula: see text], and a system ge-realizes [Formula: see text] if it generates a computation that satisfies [Formula: see text] on all hopeful input sequences. ge-synthesis is particularly relevant when the notion of correctness is multi-valued (rather than Boolean), and thus we seek systems of the highest possible quality, and when synthesizing autonomous systems, which interact with unexpected environments and are often only expected to do their best. We study ge-synthesis in Boolean and multi-valued settings. In both, we suggest and solve various definitions of ge-synthesis, corresponding to different ways a designer may want to take hopefulness into account. We show that in all variants, ge-synthesis is not computationally harder than traditional synthesis, and can be implemented on top of existing tools. Our algorithms are based on careful combinations of nondeterministic and universal automata. We augment systems that ge-realize their specifications by monitors that provide satisfaction information. In the multi-valued setting, we provide both a worst-case analysis and an expectation-based one, the latter corresponding to an interaction with a stochastic environment.",10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_28,PMC,PMC7363190,,cc-by,2020-06-16,Computer Aided Verification,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363190/,2020.0,paper

The differential diagnosis of such patients includes infectious etiologies, of which viruses are the most common [2] , but also non-infectious etiologies, such as auto-immune diseases [3] . Nonetheless, in more than half of cases, the cause remains unknown [4] . Identification of a virus can aid in patient management as it may initiate specific antiviral treatment, or cease or prevent ineffective antiviral, antibiotic, and/or immunosuppressive treatments, which all have potential harmful side effects. For example, when differentiating between an auto-immune and viral origin, immune suppression could lead to deleterious outcomes when caused by an unidentified virus [5] .During the last two decades, conventional diagnostics for viral CNS infections have shifted from non-specific culturing techniques towards highly-specific viral nucleic acid amplification tests, like"", ""Materials and Methods"": ""CSF samples which previously tested positive by viral qPCR were selected from two biobanks of the departments of medical microbiology and neurology of the Amsterdam UMC (location AMC). An HIV-1 qPCR was performed using the RealTime HIV-1 Viral Load Assay (Abbott Molecular, Abbott Park, IL, USA), the other viruses were tested by in-house qPCRs using previously published methods [19] . The first sample set consisted of anonymized leftover CSF samples (n = 27), sent in from patients with suspected CNS infection. The second set of CSF samples (n = 18) were selected from a clinical study on the etiology of encephalitis and meningitis in adult patients [2] . The study was approved by the medical ethics committee of the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands (reference number 2014_290). All samples had a quantifiable viral load and were stored at \u221280 \u2022 C until library preparation for VIDISCA-NGS.VIDISCA library preparation was performed as previously described [9, 17] . Briefly, CSF samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was treated with TURBO\u2122 DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to remove naked chromosomal or bacterial DNA. Nucleic acids were extracted using the Boom method [20] , followed by reverse transcription with non-ribosomal random hexamers [21] and second strand synthesis. DNA was digested with MseI (T\u02c6TAA; New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and ligated to adapters containing a sample identifier sequence. During the fragmentation in VIDISCA, the sample cannot be \""over-digested\"" as fragmentation relies entirely on the presence of restriction enzyme recognition sites and not on the duration of fragmentation. Ligation to adaptors leads to loss of the restriction enzyme recognition site (after ligation to an adaptor the sequence is TTAT) whereas ligation to another DNA fragment will restore it, allowing re-digestion. Next, size selection with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) was performed to remove small DNA fragments prior to a 28-cycle PCR using adaptor-annealing primers. Small and large size selection was performed with AMPure XP beads to select DNA-strands with a length ranging between 100 and 400 nucleotides. Libraries were analyzed using the Bioanalyzer (High Sensitivity Kit, Agilent Genomics, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Qubit (dsDNA HS Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific) instruments to quantify DNA length and concentration, respectively. Seventy sample libraries were pooled at the equimolar concentration. The current number of 70 samples was chosen because this has worked for other sample types (non-CSF) [16, 17] . In total, 50 pmol DNA of the pool was clonally amplified on beads using the Ion Chef System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sequencing was performed on the Ion PGM\u2122 System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the ION 316 Chip (400 bp read length and 2 million sequences per run). The method for the DNase-free VIDISCA library preparation omitted the TURBO\u2122 DNase step.All VIDISCA-NGS reads with a minimum length of 45 nucleotides were translated into protein sequences and aligned to a local database of the NCBI eukaryotic viral Identical Protein Groups (downloaded March 2018) using UBLAST [22] , the VIDISCA bioinformatics workflow [23] , and an online metagenomic profiler (Taxonomer) [24] for identification of probable viral reads and background sequence classification. Probable viral reads were subsequently confirmed when the original VIDISCA-NGS read could be aligned to a reference sequence of the virus with a nucleotide identity of at least 80% using CodonCode Aligner (version 6.0.2). Each alignment was manually inspected for confirmation. Samples were considered VIDISCA-NGS positive when at least one VIDISCA-NGS read could be identified. The number of reads aligned to a reference sequence in CodonCode Aligner was taken as the number of viral reads per sample. Analysis by VIDISCA-NGS was performed blind to qPCR results to avoid biased analysis. All statistical analyses were performed in R (version 3.5.1), and graphs were plotted using R package ggplot2 (version 3.1.0)."", ""Sample Description and qPCR Results"": ""Forty-five CSF samples from patients with a suspected CNS infection were examined. Samples had been tested by routine diagnostic for enterovirus, human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1, in case the patients were HIV-1 seropositive), parechovirus, and herpesviruses (herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1/2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7). The CSF samples contained either a single virus (n = 36) or multiple viruses (n = 9), and tested positive for HIV-1 (n = 10), enterovirus (n = 8), HSV-1/2 (n = 14), VZV (n = 8), EBV (n = 12), CMV (n = 2), and HHV-7 (n = 2).

To exclude that competition by background nucleic acids or other viruses might have hampered virus detection, we assessed whether co-infection by other pathogens or large quantities of the host genomic background had competed with viral sequences in the four samples that were negative in VIDISCA-NGS. The profile of the background sequences of the negative samples was similar to those of the positive samples, indicating that no major sequence competition was present ( Figure 2 ). Next, we determined whether the sequencing depth of the four negative samples, in combination with the low viral load, may have been insufficient. All four missed samples had fewer than 10,000 sequence reads and had a viral load below 2 \u00d7 10 4 copies/mL, as depicted in the lower left quadrant of Figure  1 .

All herpesviruses had substantially more, or a roughly equal number of viral reads in the DNase-free condition. In contrast, the opposite was true for non-herpes DNA and RNA viruses.

To this end, they need to meet certain prerequisites: Besides being broad-preferably detecting all viruses-an assay should be fast, sensitive, and affordable. VIDISCA-NGS is a unique method for viral metagenomics, which requires a relatively limited sequence depth and allows multiplexing, which reduces costs and runtime per sample [23] . As limited sequence depth, multiplexing, and speed may come at the expense of sensitivity, we evaluated the performance of VIDISCA-NGS on 45 clinical CSF samples containing viruses, quantified via conventional diagnostics (qPCR). VIDISCA-NGS detected an RNA virus in all medium to high viral load samples (>2 \u00d7 10 4 RNA copies/mL) and most (67%) of the low viral load samples. One VIDICSA-NGS positive HIV-1 sample had only 1.07 \u00d7 10 2 RNA copies/mL, demonstrating the capability to detect even very low load viruses.

One VIDICSA-NGS positive HIV-1 sample had only 1.07 \u00d7 10 2 RNA copies/mL, demonstrating the capability to detect even very low load viruses.Metagenomics has been used to detect novel or unexpected viruses in CSF in several studies [7] [8] [9] [10] , but only a limited number of studies have evaluated the performance. Two studies investigated the limit of detection using dilutions of spiked HIV-1 in CSF. One study used the Ribo-SPIA pipeline [25] , the second used a tailor-made protocol, including Nextera, to fragment and amplify [26, 27] . Both studies used >5 million reads per sample and found a limit of detection of \u224810 2 RNA copies/mL for HIV-1, comparable to that of VIDISCA-NGS when 10,000 reads are used.Besides the pathogens detected in the current study, VIDISCA-NGS has been able to detect a large number of other viruses, including members of the Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, Peribunyaviridae, Picornaviridae, Pneumoviridae, Polyomaviridae, and Retroviridae, in several types of clinical material (stool, serum, plasma, respiratory swabs) [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Thus, it is likely that VIDISCA-NGS is able to detect viruses from these families in CSF with similar sensitivities. However, our current findings now indicate there is one viral family difficult to detect with VIDISCA-NGS, namely the Herpesviridae. VIDISCA-NGS was only able to detect one high load herpesvirus (VZV, 9.29 \u00d7 10 7 DNA copies/mL) out of 34 qPCR positive samples. We hypothesized that our nuclease treatment hindered herpesvirus detection, and omitting a DNase treatment indeed yielded an additional 10 samples that were positive for herpesvirus. Of the medium to high load herpesviruses (>10 4 RNA copies/mL), DNase-free VIDISCA-NGS detected 61%.The vulnerability of herpesviruses to DNase is not unexpected. Boom et al. found that CMV DNA in serum and plasma is highly fragmented and susceptible to DNases [33] . Similarly, Perlejewski et al. described a four-fold decrease in HSV-1 reads when using a DNase treatment for metagenomics on CSF [34] . Our study expands on this knowledge by showing that the vulnerability to DNase also applies to the other herpesviruses. This vulnerability signifies that the performance of metagenomic assays should not be evaluated on spiked samples. Herpesvirus culture harvests contain infectious virions with non-fragmented DNA [33, 35] , whereas herpesvirus in cell-free clinical material is non-infectious and, as mentioned above, contains highly fragmented DNA [33, 36] . The only two studies that examined the performance of a metagenomics assay to detect herpesviruses used virus culture harvests, and found low limits of detection (\u224810 1 and 10 3 DNA copies/mL for CMV and HSV-1, respectively) [25, 26] . Caution should be taken to translate these findings to a clinical setting, as virus culture harvests are, especially for herpesviruses, not a correct representative of reality.Herpesviruses have large DNA genomes and use rolling-circle amplification to produce head-to-tail concatamers of progeny virus [37] . During the lytic replication phase, large amounts of non-infective naked progeny virus are released from the cell and may enter the CSF if replication occurs in the CNS compartment. Because of the high genome copy number and the generally low DNase activity in CSF [38] , degradation may take a significant amount of time. Naked herpesvirus DNA could thus persist for an extensive amount of time in CSF, even after the local infection has ceased. In theory, the persistence of naked DNA could also occur for other DNA viruses, such as HPV and TTV. These viruses use similar replication strategies to herpesviruses. The detection of these DNA viruses by VIDISCA-NGS was, however, not hampered by a DNase treatment (Figure 4) , indicating that the viral DNA of these viruses was part of an intact virion.Without amplification, the nucleic acid yield from CSF is generally too low for effective NGS library preparation for metagenomics [39] . For that reason, VIDISCA-NGS implements an amplification step to increase the number of viral genomic fragments from CSF. We previously found that viruses with a concentration of >10 4 copies/mL were detected when 5000 sequence reads or more were generated per sample from nasopharyngeal swabs [17] . Since then, we have used this number as a threshold to ensure that a sufficient sequence depth was achieved for virus detection. Our current results suggest this threshold may have to be increased for CSF. All RNA virus samples missed by VIDISCA-NGS had fewer than 10,000 reads and a strong correlation between the sequencing depth and number of viral reads was observed. Increasing the sequence depth could therefore increase the detection of low load RNA viruses. As such, we recommend to generate 10,000 or more reads per sample.In the current study, we multiplexed 70 samples per VIDISCA-run. While it is uncommon for a large number of patients with encephalitis to present at the same time, this method could be of substantial benefit in outbreaks [40] and research settings where large cohorts of patients have to be screened at the same time. Because the performance of VIDISCA-NGS remains lower than qPCR, especially for the detection of herpesviruses, VIDISCA-NGS cannot replace conventional diagnostics. Nonetheless, we suggest the use of standard VIDISCA-NGS (including a DNase) in parallel with conventional diagnostics, as this provides a cheap, low-input, and sensitive method to detect known, rare, and novel viruses in CSF.Supplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/10/5/332/s1, Table S1 : VIDISCA-NGS and qPCR data for all samples. ""}",Viral Metagenomics on Cerebrospinal Fluid,"Identifying the causative pathogen in central nervous system (CNS) infections is crucial for patient management and prognosis. Many viruses can cause CNS infections, yet screening for each individually is costly and time-consuming. Most metagenomic assays can theoretically detect all pathogens, but often fail to detect viruses because of their small genome and low viral load. Viral metagenomics overcomes this by enrichment of the viral genomic content in a sample. VIDISCA-NGS is one of the available workflows for viral metagenomics, which requires only a small input volume and allows multiplexing of multiple samples per run. The performance of VIDISCA-NGS was tested on 45 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with suspected CNS infections in which a virus was identified and quantified by polymerase chain reaction. Eighteen were positive for an RNA virus, and 34 for a herpesvirus. VIDISCA-NGS detected all RNA viruses with a viral load >2 × 10(4) RNA copies/mL (n = 6) and 8 of 12 of the remaining low load samples. Only one herpesvirus was identified by VIDISCA-NGS, however, when withholding a DNase treatment, 11 of 18 samples with a herpesvirus load >10(4) DNA copies/mL were detected. Our results indicate that VIDISCA-NGS has the capacity to detect low load RNA viruses in CSF. Herpesvirus DNA in clinical samples is probably non-encapsidated and therefore difficult to detect by VIDISCA-NGS.",10.3390/genes10050332,Medline; PMC,PMC6562652,31052348.0,cc-by,2019-04-30,Genes (Basel),,,,145023477.0,https://doi.org/10.3390/genes10050332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31052348/,2019.0,paper
270e9d8ac92742355bfb03480d760d78182bc6b8,Inge Mutsaers,"Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands",,"{""Introduction"": ""Throughout history, humankind has repeatedly fallen victim to dreadful epidemics or pandemics that have claimed the lives of millions over the centuries; from the 'plague of Justininan' dating back to the Roman empire, via 'the Black death' in the Middle Ages, to the 'Spanish flu' in 1918, the 'Asian flu' of 1957 and the 'Hong Kong flu' of 1968 (Zanetti and Zappa, 2010) . By the 1970s it had become common to believe that infectious diseases were declining and would be soon eliminated through medical progress. This optimistic view appears to have been na\u00efve. In recent decades the world has been confronted with an ever-increasing number of novel or re-emerging infectious diseases, some of them causing true pandemics. Striking examples were the emergence of Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in the early 1980s and the more recent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 (Zanetti and Zappa, 2010) . It has been widely accepted in modern science that new viral strains will emerge and continue to pose challenges to public health and the scientific communities of future societies (Cohen, 2000; Medina and Garcia-Sastre, 2011; Sassetti and Rubin, 2007) .In April 2009, a new influenza virus emerged in the United States and Mexico. In the weeks that followed, the 'Mexican flu' (later called the 'H1N1 Swine flu virus', named after the subtype numbers of its hemagglutanin (H) and neuraminadase (N) surface antigens) spread rapidly around the world. On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the first flu pandemic of the 21st century (Butler, 2010b; Chan, 2009 ). This outbreak and its rapid spread across the world revived the debate on protection against infectious diseases.The response to the Swine flu pandemic is characterised by substantial ambiguity, on the socio-political as well as the scientific level. In various publications, in mass media, and in scientific journals the severity of the threat, and of the accompanying protection measures considered necessary have been stressed by referring to the dreadfulness of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic (Barry, 2009) . At the same time, other people (including scientists) were much more reluctant and argued that the pandemic would not be that severe (Editorial Nature, 2009; Reporter BBC News, 2009 ). This article analyses and problematises the biosecurity measures taken in response to viral threats (see also, Collier and Lakoff, 2008, p.27) .The second event that will be assessed is the disturbance caused by the fabrication of a mutant Avian influenza virus (Butler, 2011) . In view of a potential future Avian flu pandemic, virologists have succeeded in fabricating a mutant version of the Avian flu that is capable of transmission between humans, in order to get more insight in flu evolution, and to prepare the production of future vaccines and antiviral medicines. This preventive approach has the downside that such lab-bred viruses could escape from the lab or be abused by terrorists.To come to terms with the biosecurity measures in response to these recent viral threats Sloterdijk's trilogy Spheres (1998 may serve as an instrument to analyse and assess the \""immunisation responses\"" to both the Swine flu pandemic and the Avian flu threat. In his 'Immunology of Spheres', Sloterdijk uses immunological concepts to analyse and assess the current biopolitical situation. He draws a parallel between the immune system on the biological level and immune systems on socio-political and cultural level. By building on this analogy between the biological immune system and \""immune responses\"" on socio-political level, this article shows how an immunological framework can be fruitful for grasping (assessing and reconceptualising) biosecurity. This mode of inquiry into problematisations of biosecurity is that of a second-order observer (Rabinow) (Collier and Lakoff, 2008, p.12) . The analysis will be illustrated with quotations from Nature and Science articles (News and Opinion articles & Editorials) that deal with these two threats. The 'Sloterdijkean' analysis will be supplemented with the views of the American cultural critic Susan Sontag (1933e2004) , notably her notion of apocalyptic discourse as reflected in her commentary on the AIDS pandemic in the late 1980s (notably in AIDS and its Metaphors, 1988) .The analysis will show how rather defensive \""immunisation responses\"" against viral threats sometimes bring about considerable collateral damage. Biosecurity measures sometimes risk evolving into \""autoimmune\"" responses. Autoimmunity is a biological concept that refers to an immune response directed against a body's own cells and tissues. In its metaphorical use as diagnostic tool, autoimmunity refers to a situation in which the protective measurements are more destructive than the original threats themselves and immunisation becomes a major threat to social (political) life itself. In the final part, it is shown how a One-Health approach could mitigate and act as counter-measure against the tendency towards \""autoimmune\"" responses (whether caused by virological research, industrial animal agriculture or other institution). It will be shown how on the biological level the immune system does not simply operate as 'defence army' against all possible intruders of the body. Whether a virus or a microbe is 'seen' as something that must be attacked and destroyed is very depended upon the context in which the immune reaction takes place. Immunological processes like tolerance ('silence' of the immune system upon encounter of a pathogen) and autoimmunity have proven that the immune system is far more complicate than a protective army against destructive invaders (Tauber, 2008, p.272) . In this article, it is defended that such biomedical insights on the functioning of the immune system enable to assess and reconceptualise biosecurity."", ""Peter Sloterdijk's immunological framework"": ""In his trilogy Spheres [Sph\u20ac aren] (1998, 1999, 2004) , Sloterdijk argues that humans are essentially sphere-building and spheredependent beings. Human life has always been lived within what he calls protective 'immunising spheres' (Sloterdijk, 1998) . For Sloterdijk, culture as such revolves around a process of immunisation (Sloterdijk, 1998 (Sloterdijk, , 2001 . Spheres are spatial environments that function as protective immune systems. They defend us from looming threats coming from outside and create an ambiance, a place that humans can inhabit and that allows them to live their life in the immensity of the world. Humans are beings that have built and build caves, houses, villages, cities, nation-states, cultures, world-views etc., which act as immune systems or immune responses against possible threats from the outside world. This capacity to build protective spheres is not restricted to material environments such as villages, cities and, eventually, the metropolises of today, but it also involves protective ideological and symbolical structures such as metaphysical and religious views.Sloterdijk argues that with the development of science and technology, formerly implicit aspects of the world (such as viruses) have become increasingly explicit. Sloterdijk's notion of 'explication' is akin to Heidegger's notions of 'unveiling' [Entbergung] , which for both of them constitutes the core of science and technology. Sloterdijk refers to the 20th century as the \""age of explication\"" [Explikationszeitalter] (Sloterdijk, 2004, p.228) . In this century, science and technology have developed rapidly. From the time of Pasteur and Koch onwards, for example, human beings suddenly had to take explicit measures to protect themselves against the thus far unknown microbes. Sloterdijk shows how new knowledge also results in the corollary explication (and thus perception) of new risks and threats. Indeed, in Sloterdijk's view, 'immunisation' (as cultural phenomenon, including its biomedical forms) has nowadays become a focus of concern, due to forces of globalisation. This is illustrated by a profound desire for protection by means of insurances, security measures, vaccines, and so on. However, these 'immunisation' measures simultaneously (and paradoxically) entail a growing sense of more and deeper insecurity, which, in its turn, entails more and more emphasis on immunisation and so on. In the following, Sloterdijk's immunological framework will be operationalised. The Sloterdijkean concepts of 'immunisation' and 'explication' of Sloterdijk will be applied as diagnostic tool to analyse and problematise the biosecurity measures taken in response to successively the Swine flu pandemic and the Avian flu threat. However, this article extends Sloterdijk's immunological framework. It also employs other immunological concepts, such as the notion of autoimmunity. By drawing a more complete and precise parallel between the functioning of the biological immune system and \""immune responses\"" on socio-political level some contemporary biosecurity measures are further assessed and problematised. In the third part, it is shown how a One-Health approach could 'cure' some of the 'pains' (i.e. \""autoimmune\"" responses) of contemporary biosecurity."", ""The immunisation paradox in recent viral threats"": ""In April 2009, the emergence of a new strain of H1N1 influenza virus took the world by surprise. It first emerged in Mexico and the United States, but in the weeks that followed, it spread rapidly to countries worldwide. As it turned out, the surface proteins of the virus were strikingly similar to those of the 1918 Spanish flu virus that had caused a pandemic 90 years earlier. It then killed up to 50 million people worldwide (Nabel et al., 2011) . Accordingly, in several scientific articles the severity of the threat (and the 'immunisation measures' considered necessary) was stressed by referring to the dreadfulness of this 1918 pandemic of the Spanish flu (Barry, 2009) . Following the threat and these premonitions, an \""immunisation response\"" erupted, not only on the biomedical scene (development and distribution of vaccines and antiviral medicines) but also at the societal level (public health measures; surveillance, quarantine, hygiene, etc.).On the one hand, virology in general enables the emergence of an effective biological immunisation response, such as in the H1N1 case. Virological research has revealed the genetic characteristics of H1N1, its transmissibility, etc. in order to make informed decisions on how to control and counteract the virus's spread (Hayden, 2009 ). On the other hand, virological research obviously increases our knowledge about viruses, about their genes, their virulence, their interaction with hosts, and their spread. This progressive understanding has also made us more aware of the potential new risks we are exposed to. This ambivalent effect of virological research is captured nicely by the following quote from Nature: \""The boost in research spending on epidemiological modelling and laboratory studies has enabled scientists to understand the H1N1 virus in record time, prepare to manufacture vaccine faster, make more informed decisions on how to intervene in the virus's spread, and understand and share information on its genetic characteristics\"" (Hayden, 2009, p.756) . In this phrase, it is suggested that our increased knowledge will boost our immunisation response. In the following quote, however, the basic ambivalence already becomes more apparent: \""If researchers know the key genetic regions that facilitate reassortment, surveillance efforts could watch out for H5N1 of H1N1 viruses with changes in those regions, ones that might be on the verge of dangerous reassortments\"" (Maher and Butler, 2009, p.157) . In other words, increased knowledge about the Swine flu genes might result in the discovery of an even more dangerous and virulent 'reassortment' of the virus. Reassortment, or gene mixing, refers to the exchange of segments of the viral genome of two distinct virus strains as a result of simultaneous infection of a single cell by two distinct influenza viruses. This can result in the generation of a novel influenza virus strain, and it is believed that most human pandemic viruses actually arose in this way (Medina and Garcia-Sastre, 2011) .These quotes already indicate that new knowledge not only resulted in the idea that we are protected from Swine flu once and for all. On the contrary, increased knowledge about Swine flu has resulted in the emergence of new and previously unknown threats, the threat of an even more virulent virus. This new disconcerting knowledge involves what Sloterdijk refers to as 'collateral damage' (Sloterdijk, 2004, p.200 ). If new diseases or new viral strains are discovered, the feelings of security or comfort (among both experts and the public) will not increase. The opposite is actually more true, there is an increase of uneasiness or distrust because of the increased awareness of new potential risks in society (Sloterdijk, 2004, p.198e201 ). This is a paradigmatic example of what could be termed the 'immunisation paradox', the idea that \""immunisation measures\"" result in the concomitant 'explication' of previously unknown risks and threats and feelings of insecurity, which entail more and more emphasis on immunisation.Moreover, the collateral damage is two-fold. First of all, increase in our knowledge about the Swine flu unravels potential new risks, for example the risk of dangerous reassortments or mutants of the virus that makes it more virulent, transmissible or resistant to drugs (Maher and Butler, 2009 ). Secondly, new knowledge about viruses and new techniques, for example the technique of 'resurrecting' former (now extinct) viruses such as the 1918 flu virus, actually creates new forms of risk associated with the technology itself. Although a fully reconstructed virus might gain a better understanding of the virus and thus be instrumental in fighting the next pandemic, there is nonetheless a risk of accidental or intentional release (bioterrorism) of the virus from the lab (Beck, 2002; Bubnoff, 2005; Interlandi, 2010) . The paradoxical implications of this so-called 'pre-emptive' strategy will be further discussed later in the manuscript."", ""\""Autoimmune\"" responses in biosecurity"": ""In hindsight, the Swine flu pandemic has turned out to be very mild. The dramatic pestilence that many (experts as well as ordinary people) had expected did not occur. There have definitively been casualties: the most seriously affected involved relatively young people, and one quarter of the seriously afflicted patients had no pre-existing underlying disease (Butler, 2009; Osterhaus, 2010 ). Yet, the downside of the lack of virulence of H1N1 and the relative mildness of the pandemic is that many countries were left with a stockpile of unused H1N1 vaccines. As a result, in hindsight, many governments have been criticised for squandering taxpayers' money on supplies that were not needed. Several critics have been prompting accusations that the WHO has been guilty of scaremongering and exaggerating the Swine flu threat and accordingly have accused scientists and the WHO of 'over-reacting'. Moreover, these critics point to partnerships between the virologists involved and drugs companies providing the vaccines (Butler, 2010a; Cohen and Carter, 2010 ; Editorial Nature, \""Lessons from a pandemic\"", 2010).Retrospectively, one could argue that the \""immunisation response\"" to the threat and the accompanying scares and fears may have been more socially and economically disruptive than the harm caused by the disease itself. On these grounds, the response to the threat could be labelled as an instance of what cultural critics like Sloterdijk, but also Jacques Derrida and Roberto Esposito have referred to as 'excessive immunisation' or an 'autoimmune pathology' (Sloterdijk, 2004; Borradori, 2003; Esposito, 2008) . The concept of autoimmunity has its origins in the biomedical sphere and indicates -in simplified terms e a situation in which the immune system operates so powerfully, that it produces detrimental effects for the body it is supposed to safeguard. When used as a metaphor for socio-political responses, autoimmunity refers to a situation when the striving for immunisation or self-protection becomes more damaging to the life e the veins and tissues e of society than the original threat. In that case, the protection of life, the effort to exclude any intrusion from the outside may become obsessive to such an extent that it risks destroying not only the alleged enemy outside, but first and foremost the social 'body' it is meant to protect, i.e., society.Governments were faced with predictions concerning a new influenza virus from which a large proportion of the world's population was not protected (many had no or little immunity). Taken into account the uncertainty of the predictive epidemiological models, governments have chosen to base their policies on the principle of prudence: \""preparing for the worst while hoping for the best,\"" as advocated by Dr Keji Fukuda of WHO (Osterhaus, 2010, p.142) . Referring to the fact that it is impossible to predict the course of an influenza pandemic at an early stage because of the unpredictability of the virus, virologists such as Osterhaus justify their caution by arguing that the policy of \""better safe than sorry\"" is warranted (Osterhaus, 2010, p.142) .There is a clear logic behind this way of reasoning. The problem, however, is that there is a price to pay for this prudence, as these warnings and premonitions do evoke anxieties and fear (sometimes causing public reluctance concerning vaccination). These carry financial as well as political consequences (Editorial Nature, 2009 ; see also Wildavsky, 1988) . This prudent \""immune reaction\"" thus risks evolving into an \""autoimmune\"" response."", ""\""Autoimmune\"" responses: looming viral threats"": ""Furthermore, the delay of vaccine delivery has resulted not only in an estimated of 1 million extra infections, but also burdened health care systems with tens of millions of unused vaccine doses (Jack, 2010; St\u20ac ohr, 2010). On a political level, the Council of Europe has written an evaluation report on the handling of the H1N1 pandemic entitled \""The Handling of the H1N1 Pandemic: More Transparency Needed\"" (Flynn, 2010) . The immediate cause for this evaluation report was a motion tabled under the title \""Faked Pandemics e a Threat for Health,\"" by Dr Wolfgang Wodarg (2009). Although the intention was to write a clear-cut evaluation of the topic, the document abounds in ambiguities. On the one hand, virologists are accused of inciting \""unjustified scares and fears about health risks\"" and of \""sensationalism and scaremongering in the public health domain\"" (Flynn, 2010, p.1) . On the other hand, this document itself warns for \""the next disease of pandemic scope e which may turn out to be much more severe than the H1N1 pandemic\"" (Flynn, 2010, p.1) . Although the response to the Swine flu pandemic is diagnosed as excessive, at the same time the document refers to the looming threat of a potentially more severe \""next disease of pandemic scope\"", thereby evoking a new catastrophic foresight with all the accompanying concerns and fears.Thus, the viral threat still remains and it is only a matter of time before we are hit by a deadlier influenza pandemic. Virologists and other public health officials and experts keep on warning for the possibility that the threat still exists: \""We're worried the virus could increase its disease-causing ability\"" (Ledford, 2009, p.1) . They even warn for a false sense of security: \""The danger now is that last year's relatively mild pandemic will create a false sense of security and complacency. The reality is that the next time we might not be so lucky (\u2026)\"" (Editorial Nature, 2010, p.136).The apocalypse of a pandemic is present in a more threatening way than ever, at least according to prominent virologists such as Osterhaus. He warns for an imminent pandemic of a viral (flu) strain. The exact moment it will strike is yet uncertain but the fact that a pandemic will strike sooner or later is something to be expected (Osterhaus, 2010) . Many virologists such as Osterhaus justify their warnings against a pandemic by saying that we always should 'expect the unexpected' (Butler, 2009, p.21; Weiss and McMichael, 2004, p.S75; Howard and Fletcher, 2012, p.10 ). This rhetoric is comparable to the rhetoric on AIDS described by Susan Sontag in AIDS and its Metaphors (1988), which seems to be aimed at accustoming us with \""the intermittent awareness of a monstrous, unthinkable e but we are told quite probable e pandemic catastrophe\"" (Sontag, 1988 p.88) . Such taste for worstcase scenarios seems to reflect the constant need to master fear of what is felt to be out of control (1988, p.87) . The warning 'expect the unexpected' entails a situation in which constant fear is provoked, rather than fear of a specific disease at a specific moment; as such, it produces a kind of sustained state of fear. Sontag (1988) has argued how it seems that in modern society, the end is believed to be near, but this is a \""long-running serial\"", a protracted condition rather than a terminal event. It is a state that always looms but never happens (Sontag, 1988, p.88 ; see also Fitzpatrick, 2003 Fitzpatrick, , p.1310 . As she puts it, it is not \""Apocalypse Now,\"" but rather \""Apocalypse from now on\"" (Sontag, 1988 p.88) . It seems that virologists who warn for the looming threat of viruses and pandemics try to make the pandemic catastrophe a key element of our \""ordinary horizon of expectations\"". In contemporary society, the state of concern has become interminable (Cooper, 2008a,b; Fitzpatrick, 2003) , which can be regarded \""an autoimmune pathology\"", or as Sontag puts it: \""an unparallelled violence that is being done to our sense of reality, to our humanity\"" (Sontag, 1988 p.88) .These concerns for a looming viral threat are closely connected with key characteristics of viruses, such as their invisibility to the naked eye, their capacity to mutate and evolve very quickly. Viral infections are particularly difficult to eradicate because viruses adapt continuously to their environment by mutation, recombination or gene reassortment (Morens et al., 2004) . Furthermore, globalisation promotes the emergence and spread of new infections and pandemics (Zanetti and Zappa, 2010) . Accordingly, virologists state that \""yet at the end of the day, making predictions about this new H1N1's next move is a mug's game. There's nothing more predictable about flu than its unpredictability\"" (Cohen, 2009a, p.997) . When, where and how the next catastrophe will strike remains uncertain, disaster is always incubating and one can only speculate (Ewald, 2001) . Accordingly, the inescapable elusive and uncertain characteristics of viral threats call for drastic and immediate \""immunisation measures\"". Some virologists argue that H2N2 looms and could re-emerge in a similar way as H1N1 did. Accordingly, they urge for a \""pre-emptive\"" vaccination strategy against this potential threat (Nabel et al., 2011; St\u20ac ohr, 2010 ). Yet, such pre-emptive strategies are likely to generate their own incalculable dangers and incorporate autoimmunitary aspects, as will be shown in the next section."", ""\""Autoimmune\"" responses: pre-emption"": ""Pre-emption is a concept originating from international law, it authorised a state to counter-strike when it had a warning or visible evidence of an imminent attack. However, in the course of time the doctrine of pre-emption has changed, mainly in response to the World Trace Center (WTC) attacks of 9/11/2001 (National Security Strategy, 2002) . In Life as Surplus (2008), Cooper points out that what is radically new about this doctrine is that the US authorised itself to use pre-emptive action against a threat that is not so much imminent as emergent; \""a threat whose actual occurrence remains irreducibly speculative, impossible to locate or predict\"" (Cooper, 2008b, p.124) . In recent decades, newly emerging infectious diseases, but also bioterrorist threats, such as the anthrax attacks of 2002, induced a shift in the approach to disease from classic public health (managing known diseases) to preparedness practices (developing the capacity to respond to yet unknown potentially catastrophic biological events (Lakoff, 2008;  pp.14, 33e60)).The strategy of pre-emption has also been taken up and employed by the field of infectious diseases. In view of a potential future Avian flu pandemic, two groups of scientists (one led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka at the University of Tokyo and the University of WisconsineMadison, and one led by Ron Fouchier of the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands), have created mutant H5N1 Avian influenza variants that can be transmitted between ferrets, which are a good proxy for how flu behaves in other mammals, including humans (Herfst et al., 2012; Imai et al., 2012) . To date, however, H5N1 viruses have very scarcely been transmitted between humans. Nevertheless, as H5N1 viruses continue to evolve and infect humans, the viral experts concerned warn for the fact that variants of H5N1 viruses with pandemic potential, including Avianehuman reassortant viruses, might emerge (Kawaoka, 2012) . In this specific case, the doctrine of preemption implies that we need not only to mobilise against currently circulating viruses, but against a potential emergence of a possible disease, in this case a transmissible mutant version of the Avian flu, which (as far as one knows) does not exist yet. This could be regarded as a form of 'anticipatory evolution' (Bacher et al., 2002) .The transmissibility studies of H5N1 Avian influenza sparked a fierce debate within the life science community and e although instigated by the media e among the general public, about the 'dual-use' risks involved in publishing the results of this research.The results of such studies can be used for beneficial purposes (i.e. understanding and counter-acting a future viral threat), but can also be misused for malevolent purposes with potentially severe effects on public health (for instance: bio-terrorism) (Butler, 2012; Brumfiel, 2012) .The protagonists of publication of the mutant flu studies assure that their research sheds light on influenza transmission. They argue that their research will deepen our understanding of what allows a virus to cross the species barrier and jump from other animals to humans. The benefits for monitoring wild viruses for potentially dangerous mutations and for vaccine development outweigh the risks, the protagonists claim (Hunter, 2012; Maher, 2012) . \""Don't censor life-saving science\"", argues virologist Peter Palese (2012, p.115) . Palese argues that the transmissibility experiments actually allow virologists to understand what makes a virus dangerous and how it can be disabled (Palese, 2012, p. 115) . Fouchier, author of one of the mutant flu papers, argues similarly that publication of his study could help stop a future pandemic, whether natural or as a result of an act of terrorism (Hunter, 2012) . Accordingly, imposing censorship on publication would be counterproductive, to the extent that it constrains the development of suitable countermeasures such as vaccines (Hunter, 2012) .However, it is important to keep in mind that the actual occurrence of an Avian flu pandemic remains irreducibly speculative e impossible to locate or predict. Moreover, the pre-emptive strategy also involves \""autoimmunitary\"" aspects: although the studies were aimed at finding ways to prevent a devastating Avian influenza pandemic (to engineer a cure), they involved the creation of a novel, more transmissible Avian flu virus. Thus, this simple act seemed to enhance the chances of a pandemic, owing to either a lab accident or intentional release by terrorists. Nature also warns against the dangers (the \""autoimmunitary\"" aspects) of this development by arguing that one should keep in mind that public health services are currently not equipped to mitigate a H5N1 pandemic, either accidental or intentional, due to the (worldwide) limited abilities to manufacture and distribute vaccines (Editorial Nature, 2012; Cohen, 2009b) ."", ""\""Autoimmune\"" responses: nature as bioterrorist"": ""It seems that, carried by fear and anxiety, the doctrine of preemption is of growing importance and popularity for managing not only a proliferating range of political problems, but also for coping with viral threats. There is an increased demand for public health preparedness to focus not only on interventions against known recorded viral strains but on generic measures that would be effective against yet unknown, not recorded but theoretically possible viral strains (Collier and Lakoff, 2008, p.12e16) . The idea behind pre-emption is to intervene in the conditions of emergence of the future, before one may be besieged by nature's own act of emergence (Cooper, 2008a, p.91) . In the case of the mutant Avian flu, virologists make use of exactly that argument. Professor John Oxford from Barts and the London School of Medicine says, \""The biggest risk with bird flu is from the virus itself. We should forget about bio terrorism and concentrate on Mother Nature\"" (Walsh, 2011, p.1) . In similar vein, Osterhaus argues that the bigger danger is that \""nature will do the first job\"" (quoted from Check, 2005, p.406) . Similarly, Fouchier and De Jong (virologists) claim that \""nature is the biggest terrorist\"" (Carvajal, 2011, p.A28; Visser, 2012, p.1) . Their argument clearly states that virologists should be allowed to pre-emptively 'attack' nature, before nature itself will 'attack' us.In these quotes, the virologists concerned literally align nature and bioterrorism, a natural viral threat and a threat from bioterrorism, and as such this example represents the surreptitious militarisation of infectious diseases (Cooper, 2008a) . From the perspective of these virologists, the only viable protection strategy against evolving infectious diseases, against an uncertain biological future, is one of aggressive counter-proliferation. Whether the threat is unintentional or intentional, i.e., whether it comes from human terrorists or from nature does not really make a difference.However, one must realise that the potential of biological resistance is inexhaustible because of the co-evolution between viruses and their hosts, including humans. As a result, the preemptive war will be indefinite in time and scale (Dubos, 1987 (Dubos, [1959 ). In other words, the 'war', however smart it will be, will become interminable. Lederberg labelled this scenario, 'our wits versus their genes' (Lederberg, 1998, p.463) .This specific development within the field of virology is not surprising, since it seems to fit within a wider development, which some philosophers have designated a reinforcement of the \""biologisation of politics\"" (Esposito, 2008; Rose, 2001) . This means that the rapid technological and scientific developments within the life sciences, and our deepened understanding of biological life at the molecular level, have resulted in the fact that human existence (at the biological level) has increasingly become the dominant concern of government attention. The idea of 'pre-emptive war' against all possible offenders, including terrorists as well as viruses, seems to be the quintessential result of this development. Esposito regards this to be the \""autoimmune illness\"" of contemporary political culture, by pointing to the paradoxical results of this strategy and by indicating that this 'excessive defense' actually ruins the body politic it is meant to protect (Esposito, 2008, p.147e148) .The practice of pre-emptive immunisation as applied to infectious diseases thus appears to convey a militaristic approach. This pre-emptive approach expresses a reductionist and defensive, rather than a One-Health (ecological approach) to biosecurity. Cooper (2008a) also noted how this growing entanglement between the protection of biological life (immunisation) and the imposition of a permanent state of war is something that needs to be contested (p.99; Thacker, 2005) . Yet, as long as we (virologists, but also politicians and the public at large) regard \""nature as the biggest terrorist\"", this entanglement is rather furthered than contested."", ""One-health as counter-measure against autoimmunity"": ""Thus far, it has been shown that contemporary immunisation practices within the field of infectious diseases, including the controversial practice of pre-emption, reproduce a rather reductionist defensive perspective on biosecurity. The discontents of such reductionist defensive biosecurity measures have been outline by building on the notion of autoimmunity. It appears that the perception of the virus as the invading 'other' (or enemy) has consequences for the way biosecurity is conceptualised and infectious diseases are dealt with.In view of the collateral damage involved in fierce \""immunisation measures\"", in what follows some recent developments in virology and immunology will be sketched out. In immunology a few important developments can be discerned, which are very relevant for reconceptualising biosecurity. Building on these biological insights, it will be shown how the One-Health approach could mitigate the autoimmunitary tendencies in biosecurity measures against viral threats. The biological immune system will again function as analogy for immune responses on the socio-political level, not because biology is the model per se (that would come down to biologism), but because the conceptual 'surplus' in biological immunology could enrich the socio-political repertoire of \""immune responses\"", including the \""immunisation response\"" against infectious disease threats.In virology it is recognised that the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases reflects various changes in human ecology: increases in population size and density; increase in the number and movement of refugees; changes in personal behaviour and life style; and human-induced global changes, including climate change. Medical technology can also pose a risk and unintentionally introduce and spread infectious diseases. Drug-resistant microbes, contaminated equipment or biological medicines produced from animal-cell substrates can also present an inherent potential for introducing new infections (Weiss and McMichael, 2004) . All these factors cause patterns of infectious diseases to change globally and on a massive scale. This illustrates how human health obviously cannot be separated from planetary conditions in general, i.e. from our total planetary 'health', including the health status of its animate and inanimate environment (see also, Canguilhem, 1989) . We live in interdependent existence with the totality of the living and non-living world. Accordingly, today we understand that the concept of the microbe as the single cause of infection (as Koch has postulated) is inadequate and incomplete, because it ignores the influence of the host, the milieu, and the social and physical environment (Budd et al., 2009; Weiss and McMichael, 2004; Wilson, 1995) . Next to all fundamental viral research, we should pay at least as much attention to the ecological and climatological factors such as increased global population, increased travel, intensive animal farming and food production, global climate change, prophylactic doses of antibiotics and other drugs, and so on (Rappuoli, 2004) .In immunology, a similar development towards more attention for the context (of immune responses) can be traced. In the 19th century, immunology began as a study on how a host organism reacts to pathogenic injury and how it defends itself against microbial incursion (Tauber, 1999, p.459) . In that pathological context, immunology came to be defined as the science that discriminates between self and non-self (other) (Tauber, 1994) . In recent decades, processes such as immunological tolerance ('silence' of the immune system upon the encounter of a pathogen) and autoimmunity have pointed immunologists to the fact that the immune system is far more complex than simply a 'defence army' against destructive invaders (Tauber, 2008, p.272) . It appeared that the immune system does not attack and destroy all invading pathogens, but includes a more nuanced and diverse repertoire. Immunologists increasingly recognise the importance of the 'context' of immune reactivity (Tauber, 2008 (Tauber, , 2012 . Whether a virus or microbe is 'seen' as 'enemy' is dependent upon the context in which the immune reaction takes place. It appears that an antigen (that which elicits an immune response) is not a priori 'non-self' or the 'enemy', but only attains its 'meaning' within a particular context. In other words, immune responses are not based on intrinsic foreignness, but rather on how the immune system perceives an antigen (of the virus) in the larger context of the body's economy (Tauber, 2000, p.241 ). The immune system is thus in constant 'dialogue' with surrounding tissues and the exterior. In that way, the immune system determines what is to be protected and healed and what is foreign, and thus must be attacked and destroyed (Tauber, 2000 (Tauber, , 2008 .Although the immune reaction is often pictured as a hostile encounter between self and non-self -including its associated military metaphors of combat, invasion, aggression or counterattack e (Tauber, 1999, p.526) , this is not because the hostile encounter is axiomatic, but because its associated events are the most salient and consequential (Tauber, 1999, p.526 ). Yet, on the biological level, the norm in such encounters is \""truce rather than war, tolerance instead of destruction\"" (Tauber, 1999, p.526; Burnet, 1962, p.39) . As such, the biological body is not a battlefield, moreover, nor is the political body.For this reason, it is of utmost importance to also get rid of military metaphors in the debates on protection against infectious diseases. Besides, the account of all the factors involved in the transmission, evolution and emergence of infectious diseases described above underlines the nonsensicalness of utterances such as \""nature is the biggest bioterrorist\"", or \""Mother Nature as biggest threat\"" (Walsh, 2011; Carvajal, 2011; Visser, 2012) . As humans, we are an integral part of nature and our role is of crucial importance in the current upsurge of infectious disease incidence. As Sontag e so eloquently remarked e paraphrasing Lucretius e:, \""about that military metaphor (\u2026) \""give it back to the war-makers\"" (Sontag, 1988, p. 95) .The biological insight that immune responses include much more than simply a form of defence against an invading non-self (an a priori enemy) can (and should) be used to reconceptualise biosecurity. The contextual scheme of immunology should be transposed to the level of \""immunisation measures\"" involved in biosecurity. Parallel to the immune system, which appears to be far more complex and nuanced than a destructive army, the \""immune responses\"" involved in biosecurity should be more nuanced and complex and take into account the context in which they take place. \""Immunisation measures\"" that do not take into account the context in which they are applied do not only risk developing into \""autoimmune\"" responses but they are also less effective (Bingham and Hinchliff, 2008, p.174e193 ). This context thus not only involves the climatological and ecological factors involved in the emergence of viral threats (as emphasised by \""ecological virologists\"" or \""evolutionary virologists\"" (Cf. Suttle, 2007; Galama, 2010; Varela et al., 2009; Wilson, 1995) , but also the political context and socioeconomic conditions (Bingham and Hinchliff, 2008, p.174e193 ). Thus, a One-Health approach will not only prevent \""immunisation responses\"" evolving into \""autoimmune\"" responses but also increases the effectiveness of biosecurity measures. A One-Health approach that incorporates a broader and more nuanced \""immunological repertoire\"" than aggressive counter-proliferation not only acts as counter-measure against autoimmunitary tendencies but might also vitalise e in the words of Sloterdijk e the \""mental immune status of our enlightened society\"" (Sloterdijk, 2004, p.196 )."", ""Conclusion"": ""The Sloterdijkean immunological framework has shown how \""immunisation\"" attempts often concomitantly also explicate new viral threats. It has been argued how viral research potentially brings about 'collateral damage', through the explication of formerly unknown risks, for example the emergence of a more virulent reassortment of the virus. Given important characteristics of viruses such as their invisibility, their unpredictability, and their capacity to mutate quickly, virologists are bound to caution that despite immunisation measures, viral threats are always looming. This further promotes the shift to preparedness in public health, including a practice of pre-emption. The lab-bred mutant Avian flu is a paradigmatic example thereof. However, such strong defensive (and preventive) \""immunisation measures\"" risk evolving into \""autoimmune\"" responses. In the context of this article, \""autoimmune\"" responses involve a situation in which protective measures (against a viral threat) are more destructive for society than the original viral threat itself.The subsequent fierce global debate on the dual-use risks involved overlooks the fact that this strategy of pre-emption will be indefinite. If pre-emption develops into a standard doctrine, one needs to take into account the evolution rate and reassortment possibilities of this most abundant type of biological entity and the accordingly endless range of potential viral threats. The \""autoimmune\"" aspects of the lab-bred Avian flu involve not only the creation of new viruses, but also psychological damage by creating a permanent state of fear. More importantly, as long as virologists regard 'nature as the biggest bioterrorist', the worrisome entanglement between the protection of biological life (immunisation) and war including its \""autoimmunitary\"" effects will be furthered rather than contested.A One-Health approach, however, could act as counter-measure against such autoimmunitary developments. From the perspective of One-Health, the 'other' whether a virus or anything else is not a priori the enemy that has to be 'fought' and 'defeated'. The biological immune system does not simply operate as 'defence army' but mediates aggressive as well as cooperative (tolerant) interactions (Tauber, 2008) . More importantly, whether a virus or microbe is 'seen' as 'enemy' is dependent upon the context in which the immune reaction takes place. It appears that an antigen (that which elicits an immune response) is not a priori 'other' or the 'enemy', but only attains its 'meaning' within a particular context. In other words, immune responses are not based on intrinsic foreignness, but rather on how the immune system perceives an antigen (of the virus) in the larger context of the body's economy (Tauber, 2000, p.241) . Analogously, the \""immune systems\"" on socio-political level involved in biosecurity should also include a broader and more nuanced \""immunological repertoire\"". On the socio-political level not all viruses need to be (pre-emptively) 'fought'. A One-Health approach that involves such attention for the context in which (socio-political) immune reactions take place is needed.In that way, the One-Health approach involves a perspective that not only conveys how easily life is threatened, but also stresses our dependence upon others, of co-existence as a basis for our existence, biologically as well as politically. It articulates the radically dependency of humans on interrelationships with others (including viruses), as well as the vulnerability to all others. No biosecurity or immunisation measure can foreclose this dependency (Butler, 2004, p.19e50 ). This necessitates more nuanced than current attempts to achieve 'absolute' security or immunity.To conclude, the Sloterdijkean immunological framework illuminated the discontents of our (fierce) immunisation strategies and the risk of \""autoimmunity\"" in biosecurity. A One-Health approach acknowledges the fact that the fundamental dependency on anonymous others is not a condition we can get away from, neither on the political nor on the biological level. A One-Health approach that incorporates a broader \""immunological repertoire\"" than only 'fight and defeat' (i.e. pre-emption) would further our commitment to living with a certain kind of 'vulnerability to others' that actually gives our individual lives meaning (Butler, 2004, p.19e50) ."", ""Ethics approval"": ""For this paper ethical approval was not required because the paper does not include human subjects data.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,paper

In 2003, the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak was identified to be a novel, highly pathogenic, respiratory human coronavirus, the SARS-CoV [6] [7] [8] [9] .The viral envelope glycoprotein Spike (S) is a highly glycosylated trimeric type I membrane protein, which forms the typical spike structures at the envelope of coronaviruses. S is responsible for binding to cellular receptors and envelope fusion with host cell membranes. SARS-CoV S is 1255 amino-acids long. Although the exact boundaries of S transmembrane domain are not clearly defined, the N-terminal ectodomain and the C-terminal endodomain are most likely 1193 and 39 amino-acids long, respectively. SARS-CoV S mediates binding to the virus' cellular receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) on apical surfaces of epithelial cells [10, 11] . S cleavage into S1 and S2 subunits by either extracellular proteases [12] or the pH-sensitive endosomal protease cathepsin-L [13] is a prerequisite for its fusogenicity. This cleavage triggers the release of a hydrophobic fusion peptide at the N-terminal end of the S2 subunit, which inserts itself into host membranes, placing viral and cellular membranes at close proximity. S conformational changes lead to the fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. Membrane destabilization by the S juxtamembrane domain, localized in the ectodomain, as well as clusters of palmitoylated cysteines, found within the membrane-proximal half of the S endodomain, may facilitate the fusion process [14, 15] .A recent study has shown that a palmitoylation-null mutant S protein is deficient for partitioning into detergent resistant membranes and for mediating S-dependent cell-cell fusion [16] . Other regions within the endodomain may also regulate fusion and S-mediated entry into susceptible cells [17] [18] [19] . A C-terminal truncation of 17 residues was shown to increase S-mediated cellto-cell fusion [17] ; a truncation of the last 19 amino acids of S resulted in higher levels of transduction of Vero cells by murine leukemia virus (MLV) S-pseudotyped particles [19] . However it is unclear whether cellular factors bind to S endodomain and regulate fusogenicity.S endodomains are accessible to cellular machineries i/ during production, maturation, trafficking, and assembly of viral envelope proteins (pre-budding steps), and ii/ at a critical stage of virus entry, just after formation of the fusion pore, and after fusion. We hypothesized that during these crucial stages of infection, interactions between the S endodomain and cellular machineries could participate in regulating infectivity and host cell susceptibility to infection.We performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using S endodomain as bait. Here we describe for the first time the interaction between SARS-CoV S endodomain and ezrin, a member of the Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin (ERM) family of proteins. ERM have a crucial role in organizing membrane domains through their ability to interact with lipid rafts, transmembrane proteins and filamentous actin [20] . Hence, they mediate a fine-tuned linkage that strengthen the cell cortex, partition membrane clusters, and regulate signal transduction pathways [20] . Recent studies suggest that ezrin participates in the formation of either a diffusion barrier or a tether, which limits mobility of membrane components, in particular lipid rafts [21, 22] .Ezrin is found in a cytosolic dormant state where the C-terminal ERM-association domain, the C-ERMAD, and the N-terminal FERM domains interact with each other, quenching protein binding sites, and is activated through phosphatidyl-inositol 4,5 biphosphate binding and phosphorylation [20, 23] . Activation opens up the molecule and releases the FERM and C-ERMAD domains, which are then free to interact with membranes (phospholipids and endodomains of transmembrane proteins) and signaling molecules, and actin cytoskeleton, respectively [20, 24, 25] . Overexpression of the FERM domain of ezrin has a dominant negative effect, by saturating ezrin binding sites at the plasma membrane and inhibiting its interaction with actin by blocking C-ERMAD sites [20, 26] .Interestingly, viruses such as vaccinia virus and minute virus of mice were shown to modulate the pathways in which ERM proteins are involved to ensure viral entry and cell spreading, respectively [27, 28] . Furthermore, ERM proteins have been shown to have differential regulating roles in retroviral life cycles, depending on the viral step examined [29] [30] [31] [32] . Therefore, ERM proteins, which are crucial regulators of cell functions, may play important roles at various stages of virus life cycles.Our objectives were to confirm the interaction between SARS-CoV S and ezrin and to study the role of ezrin in S-dependent entry events. Here we show a novel restraining role of ezrin at early stages of SARS-CoV replication cycle. We discuss the relevance of our findings in the regulation of SARS-CoV entry in host cells."", ""Results"": ""The endodomain of the SARS-CoV S protein binds to the F1 lobe of the FERM domain of ezrin in yeastWe hypothesized that cellular proteins may interact with the carboxy-terminal endodomain of the S envelope protein and either help or restrict processes involving S. To identify such cellular factors, we performed a genomic yeast two-hybrid screen using the SARS-CoV S endodomain as bait ( Fig. 1A-B) . A random-primed cDNA library from human placenta was screened and 233 positive clones were identified. The most prominent result of the screen was the identification of the interaction between S endodomain and the cellular protein ezrin (Fig. 1A , C) with a total of 82 positive clones (35%) corresponding to this protein (Accession number: NM_003379; Fig. 1C ). The S -ezrin interaction was classified with high confidence score (Predicted Biological Score = A; Fig. 1A ) and was not found in parallel screens performed with other viral baits [33, 34] and data not shown). These data indicate that ezrin specifically interacts with SARS-CoV S endodomain in yeast.To determine the binding region of ezrin to S endodomain, the 82 ezrin cDNA sequences were aligned using ClustalW multiple sequence alignment program. All ezrin cDNA shared a common sequence of 264 base pairs corresponding to amino acids 6 to 93 (Fig. 1C) . Interestingly, this region corresponds almost completely to the F1 lobe of the N-terminal FERM domain (amino acids 2 to 82 [35] , Fig. 1C and 1D ). This suggests that interaction of ezrin with S endodomain requires a complete F1 lobe. This region was subsequently named ezrin F1/S Binding Domain or F1/SBD (Fig. 1C )."", ""S endodomain is sufficient to pull-down ezrin from epithelial cell lysates"": ""To confirm the interaction of S endodomain with human ezrin, GST-pull down assays were performed. Briefly, we used GST-fused S endodomain (GST-S endo ) protein bound to glutathione-coupled sepharose beads to pull down endogenous ezrin protein from cell lysates of HeLa human epithelial cells ( Fig. 2A) . Glutathionesepharose beads alone and GST protein fused to the ezrin FERM domain and bound to beads (GST-FERM) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively ( Fig. 2A lanes 2-3) . GST-FERM was able to pull down ezrin from the HeLa lysate. This result was expected as the FERM domain has the property to specifically interact with the C-ERMAD of ezrin. Furthermore, GST-S endo could coprecipitate ezrin in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 2A lanes 4, 5, 6) . This result confirms the interaction of the SARS-CoV S endodomain with the human ezrin protein.We then decided to analyze the interaction of the S endodomain with ezrin from the SARS-CoV-permissive Vero E6 cell line. Similarly, the GST-S endo could precipitate the Vero E6 endogenous ezrin protein ( Fig. 2B lanes 2-3) . Incubation of GST-S endo with Vero E6 cell lysates in the presence of rabbit serum against the endodomain of S significantly diminished the interaction ( Fig. 2B lanes 4-5) . Moreover, GST protein alone was not able to pull down ezrin ( Fig. 2B lane 6) , further confirming that the 39 amino-acids of SARS-CoV S endodomain are responsible for the interaction. These results collectively show that the S endodomain is capable of interacting specifically with ezrin in vitro.The last 8 carboxy-terminal residues and the membrane proximal cysteine cluster of SARS-CoV S endodomain are involved in ezrin binding in vitro To map the amino-acids on S that are important for the interaction with ezrin, we decided to construct a series of S endodomain mutants and analyze their capacity to bind ezrin in GST pull down assays (Fig. 3A) . Analysis of the SARS-CoV S endodomain sequence revealed three regions with distinctive characteristics: a carboxy-terminal basic region (amino-acids 1248-1254), a central acidic stretch (amino-acids 1239-1244) and a series of clusters of cysteine residues (amino-acids 1217-1236). We reasoned that these regions could be involved in the interaction with ezrin. First, we constructed truncation mutants by deleting the carboxy-terminal regions either containing the basic cluster or both the basic cluster and the acidic stretch. These truncation mutants consisted in deletion of eight and nineteen amino-acids, respectively (S endo D8 and S endo D19 , Fig. 3A ). As expected, glutathione-conjugated beads and GST-coupled beads could not pull down ezrin whereas beads coupled to GST-S endo wt could precipitate ezrin efficiently from a Vero E6 cell lysate ( Fig. 3B lanes 2-6) . Both D8 and D19 truncations were able to significantly diminish interaction with ezrin at similar levels, but not abrogate it ( Fig. 3B lanes 7 , 8, 9, 10) . These data show that the eight carboxy-terminal amino-acid stretch, which is rich in basic residues, is important for ezrin binding and that another motif in the endodomain may contribute to the interaction. Conversely, the acidic stretch does not seem involved in the interaction.We then analyzed the implication of the nine cysteines in the interaction with ezrin. These residues are found in the membrane proximal region of the S endodomain. To simplify the analysis, we decided to pool cysteines into four clusters, namely C1 to C4, of two to three residues (Fig. 3A) . While mutations of C2, C3, and C4 clusters had little impact on the interaction with ezrin ( Fig. 3C compare lanes 9-14 with lanes 5-6), mutation of the cluster C1 was able to almost completely abrogate the interaction (Fig. 3C  lanes 7-8) . Consistently, mutation of all clusters of cysteines also greatly reduced binding to ezrin ( Fig. 3C lanes 15-16) . This result indicates that the C1 membrane proximal cysteine cluster is important for binding to ezrin in vitro.Since endodomain truncations and cysteine to alanine mutations of the SARS-CoV S endodomain were found to diminish interaction with ezrin individually, both types of modifications were next tested simultaneously (S endo D8 C1-4 and S endo D19 C1-4 ). Additionally, a truncation mutant was tested where the cysteine cluster-containing portion (residues 1217 to 1236) of S endodomain was deleted (S endo DC ). Also, the positively-charged residue lysine 1227 and the polar residue threonine 1220 were pointmutated into alanines to investigate their possible involvement in the S-ezrin interaction (S endo K1227A and S endo T1220A ; Fig. 3A ). As expected, the DC truncation almost completely abrogated the interaction with ezrin, although a faint band was still observed further indicating that the C-terminal half of S endodomain contains some interaction determinants ( Fig. 3D lane 6) . The point mutation on the lysine K1227 did not significantly affect binding with ezrin. The point mutation on the threonine T1220 had no effect on binding with ezrin. Confirming our previous results, S endodomain mutants containing both truncations (D8 or D19), and the cysteine mutations (C1-4) were not able to bind ezrin ( Fig. 3D lanes 4-5) . Together, these data show that the membrane proximal cysteine cluster C1 and the last eight C-terminal residues are important determinants of interaction of SARS-CoV S endodomain with ezrin in vitro.Ezrin is present at the site of entry of Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particleConsidering the major role of S in virus entry and membrane fusion, we first assessed whether S endodomains could be accessible to ezrin at early stages of infection. To mimic SARS-CoV entry, we used Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles 6) . B. The endodomain of S pulls down ezrin from Vero E6 cell lysate. Similarly, cell lysate was incubated with Glutathione-Sepharose beads bound either to GST fused to S endo in absence (lanes 2-3) or presence (lanes 4-5) of rabbit serum that recognizes the endodomain of S, or to GST alone (lane 6). For both A. and B. 10 mL of cell lysate was used as input control which represents 1.6% and 4% of the volume used for the pull down for A. and B., respectively. IB: Immunoblot. Results shown are representative of two independent experiments. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0049566.g002 (SARSpp), which were previously shown to enter cells in an ACE-2, cathepsin-L, and low pH dependent pathway, faithfully recapitulating the entry process of native SARS-CoV virions [36] [37] [38] [39] . Vero E6 epithelial cells stably expressing RFP-ezrin fusion protein were infected with GFP-Vpr SARSpp. At 30 minutes post-infection, cells were analyzed using a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM) to visualize events occurring at proximity of the plasma membrane and minimize background from the other layers of the cells. Green dots corresponding to GFP-Vpr SARSpp were readily observed and found associated with RFP-ezrin enriched domains (Fig. 4 , white arrowheads, Supporting movie S1). This result indicates that ezrin is present at sites of SARSpp entry, possibly coating endosomes following internalization of particles. Similar data were obtained using a spinning disc confocal microscope on live cells expressing RFP-ezrin (data not shown). This would suggest that after the formation of the fusion pore, S endodomains facing the host cell cytosol have the possibility to interact with ezrin molecules."", ""Knock down of ezrin by siRNA increases SARS-CoV Smediated entry"": ""To investigate the potential role of ezrin in S-dependent entry, we decided to silence the expression of ezrin by specific siRNA. HeLa-F5 cells, stably expressing the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2, were transfected with siRNAs that target ezrin mRNA or nontargeting control siRNAs. The ezrin siRNA transfection decreased expression significantly, with a quantified 80% knock down at the protein level (Fig. 5A) . Ezrin siRNA was shown to slightly increase transduction levels by Denvpp and VSVGpp (around 3-and 5-fold increases, respectively) (Fig. 5B) . Interestingly, the highest foldchange observed was for SARSpp where S-mediated entry was enhanced more than 12-fold. These data indicate that ezrin expression silencing has a slight enhancing effect on entry of viral particles uptake in general, as well as a more specific highly increasing effect on entry of SARS-CoV S pseudotyped particles. This suggests a negative regulatory role for ezrin in SARS-CoV Smediated entry."", ""Mutation of the ezrin-binding domain on S endodomain favors SARSpp entry into Vero E6 cell"": ""To confirm that ezrin binding to S endodomain negatively regulates SARSpp entry, we have generated mutated SARS-CoV S proteins that contain modified endodomains and pseudotyped them. The mutated SARS S pseudotyped particles were designed by taking into account the biochemical pull-down data we have established (Fig. 3) . To completely abolish ezrin interaction, we constructed a S mutant with cysteine to alanine mutations of the first cysteine cluster and with a deletion of the last 8 amino acids (SD8 C1). Considering that the C1 mutation could have severe consequences on fusion [14] , we also generated a second S mutant with only a deletion of the 8 last amino acids of the C-terminus (SD8), a modification which should partially alter interaction with ezrin. SD8 and SD8 C1 S proteins could be incorporated into lentiviral particles (Fig. 6A , upper panel) and similar amounts of particles were found in concentrated supernatants, as indicated by detection of the HIV p24 protein (Fig. 6A , lower panel). Levels of incorporation of wt S, SD8 and SD8 C1 were quantified by densitometry and normalized to p24 levels. The ratio of S incorporation was 1 : 2.5 : 3.9 for wt S, SD8 and SD8 C1, respectively. Entry of mutated S pseudotyped particles along with wt S SARSpp was analyzed in SARS-CoV-susceptible Vero E6 cells (Fig. 6B ). Both mutated SARSpp were found to transduce Vero E6 cells more efficiently than wt S SARSpp. Although mutation of C1 is expected to induce a defect in fusion [14] , a 2fold increase in transduction was measured for SD8 C1 SARSpp. This increase can be explained by both the efficient incorporation of SD8 C1 in pseudotyped particles and the lack of interaction with ezrin. Interestingly, significantly higher levels of transduction were observed for the SD8 SARSpp, with an increase of transduction of approximately 11-fold compared to wt S SARSpp. This result is in agreement with previously published data where murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based SD8 SARSpp were found to transduce Vero cells more efficiently than wt S pseudotyped particles [19] . In our study, better incorporation of SD8 could be in part responsible for the increase of transduction. However, the difference in fold-change that was observed for SD8 incorporation into pseudoparticles and cellular transduction (2-fold compared to 11-fold increase, respectively) suggests that partial disruption of interaction with ezrin contributes to this enhancement of transduction. Taken together, these data are in agreement with the hypothesis that ezrin binding to S endodomain decreases entry of viral particles."", ""Expression of the ezrin FERM domain increases susceptibility of Vero E6 cells to SARS-CoV infection"": ""To further study the role of ezrin during SARS-CoV infection, we produced clonal Vero E6 stable cell lines that either express wild-type ezrin (ezrin wt ) or the N-terminal FERM domain of ezrin (ezrin FERM ) fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The latter form of ezrin is known to have a dominant negative effect on endogenous ezrin [26] . The levels of expression and subcellular localization of GFP-ezrin wt and GFP-ezrin FERM in selected clones were monitored by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, respectively (Fig. 7A a-b) . Flow cytometry analysis showed that clones GFP-ezrin wt and GFP-ezrin FERM had means of fluorescence intensities of 2610 3 and 7610 2 , respectively (Fig. 7A a) . As expected, GFP-ezrin wt distributed in the cell cytosol with occasional enrichments at the cell cortex, whereas GFP-ezrin FERM was almost exclusively found at the cell cortex, in membrane ruffles and lamellipodia (Fig. 7A b) . We verified that Vero E6, and clones GFP-ezrin wt and GFP-ezrin FERM expressed similar levels of ACE-2 receptor at cell surface (data not shown).The stable cell lines and control Vero E6 cells were first infected with SARS-CoV. Infection levels were then monitored by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) on the viral N gene at 3, 6 and 24 hours post infection (Fig. 7B ) and by immunofluorescence assay at 24 hours post-infection (Fig. 7C) . During the whole time course of infection, levels of N RNAs measured in infected GFP-ezrin wt cells were comparable to those counted for control Vero E6 cells (Fig. 7B ). Normalized N levels at early time points ranged between 3.2610 4 and 3.6610 4 and reached approximately 2.6610 6 at 24 hours post-infection for these two cell lines (,2 log increase between 6 and 24 hours). Interestingly, although the replication rate at 24 hours was lower in clone GFPezrin FERM than control Vero E6 cells (normalized N levels of In parallel to qRT-PCR analysis, cells were analyzed by immunolabeling and fluorescence microscopy at 24 hours postinfection (Fig. 7C a) . S was labeled to mark infected cells. All cells were stained for either actin or nuclei. For each cell line, the percentage of infected cells was calculated (Fig. 7C b) . Infection rates in Vero E6 and Vero E6 GFP-ezrin wt cells were similar with 2.5% of S-positive cells. Interestingly, a 5.8-fold increase in the percentage of infected cells (15% of cells) was observed for the GFP-ezrin FERM cell line, when compared with control cells. This higher susceptibility to infection is consistent with higher levels of N RNAs detected at early time points post-infection for the clone GFP-ezrin FERM . These data indicate that partial disruption of ezrin function by expression of its dominant negative form increases host cell susceptibility to infection."", ""Expression of the ezrin FERM domain increases Smediated entry"": ""To verify that the enhanced permissiveness to SARS-CoV infection observed in cells expressing the ezrin FERM domain is due to a higher efficiency of entry of virions, we investigated levels of transduction of control, GFP-ezrin wt and GFP-ezrin FERM clonal Vero E6 cells by SARSpp (Fig. 8A) . Interestingly, whereas the transduction level of GFP-ezrin wt was not significantly different than in control Vero E6 cells, GFP-ezrin FERM cells showed a ,15fold increase in luciferase activity values. This result indicates that clone GFP-ezrin FERM is more permissive to SARS-CoV Smediated entry and is consistent with the higher rates of infection observed with SARS-CoV in this cell line (Fig. 7B-C) .To exclude a clonal effect, a new batch of polyclonal Vero E6 cells expressing GFP-ezrin FERM was generated. As control, we used Vero E6 cells transduced to express a non-relevant HcRed protein. Expression level of GFP-ezrin FERM was monitored by flow cytometry (Fig. 8B a) . These cells were used to carry out infections using SARSpp (Fig. 8B b) . Consistently with previous data on clonal cell lines, polyclonal cells expressing GFP-ezrin FERM showed a 9-fold increase in luciferase activity, indicating higher susceptibility to SARSpp infection. Of note, SARSpp infection was not enhanced in cells selected to express high amounts of GFPezrin FERM (data not shown). Altogether, our data indicate that partial disruption of ezrin activity by expression of low levels of GFP-ezrin FERM enhances cell susceptibility to S-mediated entry and support a restraining role of ezrin at this stage."", ""Expression of the FERM domain of ezrin by target cells enhances S-mediated cell-cell fusion"": ""Our previous functional experiments have demonstrated a negative regulatory role for ezrin during S-mediated entry. To characterize further this phenomenon, we questioned whether ezrin could be involved in the S-mediated fusion process, during which S endodomains become accessible to the cytosol. To that end, we chose to study the effect of expression of the FERM domain of ezrin on S-dependent fusogenicity in an in vitro cell-cell fusion assay. In this experiment, HeLa cells stably expressing both S and a HcRed fluorescent marker (HeLa HcRed Spike) were coincubated with GFP, GFP-ezrin wt or GFP-ezrin FERM Vero E6 stable cell lines. As expected, control HeLa HcRed cells were not able to fuse with any of the three Vero E6 cell lines, as no syncytia were found (Fig. 9A panels a to c) . Similarly, no syncytia were observed for HeLa HcRed Spike cells incubated with Vero E6 stable cell lines but not activated by trypsin treatment (Fig. 9A  panels d, f and h) . Conversely, about 4.5% of nuclei were found in syncytia when HeLa HcRed Spike cells were incubated in presence of either GFP or GFP-ezrin wt Vero E6 cells after trypsin activation (Fig. 9A panels e and g and Fig. 9B ). Interestingly, 8% of nuclei were found to be in syncytia in the condition where HeLa HcRed Spike cells were co-cultured with GFP-ezrin FERM cells after trypsin activation (Fig. 9A panel i and Fig. 9B ). This 2-fold increase of fusion, linked to expression of GFP-ezrin FERM in target cells, was consistently found in four independent experiments. This result shows that target cells expressing the FERM domain of ezrin are more susceptible to S-dependent cell-cell fusion and further indicates that ezrin plays a restrictive role during SARS-CoV Sdependent fusion process."", ""Discussion"": ""Our data demonstrate for the first time an interaction between the membrane tethering protein ezrin and the endodomain of the SARS-CoV S envelope glycoprotein and describe a novel mechanism involving ezrin as a restraining factor of SARS-CoV entry. We show that ezrin, by binding to S endodomain, limits Sdependent early events of infection, most likely by affecting efficacy of fusion. Our data point towards a novel role of ezrin as a regulator of early events of infection of susceptible cells by SARS-CoV."", ""SARS-CoV S endodomain interaction with ezri"": ""Ezrin was identified for its interaction with the SARS-CoV Spike endodomain by yeast two-hybrid screening (Fig. 1A) . Analysis of sequences of prey hits has shown that the F1 lobe of the N-terminal FERM domain of ezrin mediates interaction with S endodomain (Fig. 1C-D) . FERM lobes of a number of FERMdomain containing proteins have been described as mediating specific interactions with proteins or phospholipids at the plasma membrane. For example, a region located between the F1 and F3 lobes is the site where inositol-(1,4,5)-triphosphate (IP3) interacts with the FERM domain of radixin [40] . Moreover, crystallographic data have shown that sites within the F3 lobe of radixin are the binding regions of CD44 cytoplasmic region [41] and ICAM-2 [42] . In addition, moesin F3 lobe was found to interact with the EBP50 scaffolding protein [43] .Interestingly, radixin, which shares 76% amino-acid sequence identity with ezrin [24] , was also identified in the yeast two-hybrid screening for its interaction with S endodomain, albeit with a lower Predicted Biological Score (B), and only three independent clones were found. The functional experiments presented here focused on ezrin exclusively; however, the fact that radixin was found in the screen suggests that other ERMs could be implicated in the life cycle of SARS-CoV. Furthermore, it was shown recently that ezrin, radixin, and moesin play differential roles in the life cycle of HIV-1, with some reports demonstrating that ERMs may negatively regulate post-entry events by affecting stable microtubules, and others that show ezrin and moesin as important for entry events of the virus [29] [30] [31] [32] . Experiments on radixin and moesin should be performed to further investigate whether other ERMs have a role in the SARS-CoV life cycle."", ""Confirmation of SARS-CoV S endodomain -ezrin interaction and characterization of interaction determinant"": ""GST-pull down assays (Fig. 2) showed that the S endodomain of SARS-CoV could pull down ezrin from HeLa and Vero E6 lysates, providing evidence of specific interaction between both partners. Attempts of coimmunoprecipitation using full length SARS-CoV S and ezrin have not been successful. Difficulty to coimmunoprecipitate ERM proteins in our and others' studies could be due to the low proportion of activated proteins in cells, which, moreover, interact with actin and are therefore insoluble. GST-pull down assays using a series of GST-S endodomain mutants demonstrated that residues in the last 8 amino-acids as well as cysteines (particularly the juxtamembrane-most first cluster C1) were important determinants for binding with ezrin (Fig. 3) . The positively charged amino-acids found in the very last 8 aminoacids contain a KxHxx dibasic motif that was shown to function as an ER retrieval signal [44, 45] . The positively charged amino-acids were of particular interest in our study as ERM proteins have been shown to interact with the C-terminal tails of transmembrane protein that contain juxtamembrane stretches of positively charged amino-acids [46] . The finding that the C1 cluster of S endodomain is also involved in ezrin binding in vitro is intriguing. Cysteine residues are highly conserved among coronaviral Spike proteins. SARS-CoV S cysteines are known to be palmitoylated and important for S association with detergent-insoluble cellular fractions and S-dependent cell-cell fusion [14, 16] . It could be argued that the GST-S endo proteins, which have been purified from bacteria in our study, may not reflect the palmitoylation state of S. Whether a small fraction of S C1 clusters is not palmitoylated and free to interact with ezrin in vivo would need further investigation."", ""Ezrin is present at the site of virus fusion"": ""Analysis of GFP-Vpr SARSpp entry in Vero E6 cells by TIRF microscopy has revealed that after binding and endocytosis, RFPezrin could be associated around some of the internalized particles, perhaps surrounding the endosomal membrane (Fig. 4) . Although recruitment of ezrin around endosomal membranes may not be specific to SARS particles' internalization, our result suggests that ezrin is present at the SARS-CoV fusion site. It is therefore plausible that following initiation of the pore opening, ezrin molecules come into contact with some newly accessible S endodomains. Topologically, an interaction between ezrin and S endodomains requires that the fusion pore be open. Knowing the function of ezrin in regulation of membrane fluidity, one could expect that ezrin modulates the efficacy of fusion at a step following the opening of the pore."", ""Reduction of cellular levels of ezrin enhances S-mediated entry"": ""We first studied the role of ezrin in S-mediated entry of SARSpp. Reduction of cellular levels of ezrin by gene silencing induced a marked increase in susceptibility to SARSpp by more than 12-fold (Fig. 5) . Our results also show that silencing ezrin expression enhances, to a lower extent, entry of pseudotyped particles with no envelope or VSV G. A slight ,2-fold increase in entry levels for HIV-gp-pseudotyped particles has also been observed (Supporting Fig. S1 ). No significant increase has been detected for influenza virus HA-pseudotyped particles. These enhancements have consistently been found to be lower than the one found for SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. The moderate enhancement effect of ezrin depletion by siRNA treatment on VSV G and HIV-gp pseudotyped particles suggests that ezrin may also have a general restricting effect on viral entry. Ezrin is a scaffolding protein that links actin cytoskeleton and cholesterolrich lipid domains at the plasma membrane. It contributes to membrane structure and organization. First, ezrin provides rigidity to specific cortical areas of the cell by linking membranes to cortical actin. For instance, ezrin is important for extensions of lamellipodia and filopodia [47, 48] . Second, ezrin enables the organization of membrane microdomains by controlling fluidity of membrane components. This process is extremely important in the regulation of signalization by trans-membrane receptors and signaling molecules [49] [50] [51] . Moreover, ezrin enables the compartmentalization of signaling molecules into microclusters and prevents their free movement to restrict signaling. This has been well described for the B and T cell receptors [50, 52] . Therefore, it is possible that the membrane rigidity induced by ezrin limits viral entry in general, with a more important effect on SARS-CoV Smediated entry, due to the specific interaction with S.Of note, ezrin was also identified as a strong enhancer of SARS-CoV S-mediated entry in an independent functional siRNA library screen performed in the laboratory (Dr. Dongjiang Tang, Dr. Peigang Wang, BN, unpublished data). In this study, a library targeting 122 cellular genes implicated in cellular trafficking was used to characterize cell factors that regulate SARSpp entry. Remarkably, ezrin siRNAs had the second-most enhancing effect."", ""Mutation of the S protein ezrin-binding domain is associated with an increase of SARSpp transduction level"": ""The deletion of the last 8 amino acids of the S protein, which was shown biochemically to decrease interaction with ezrin (Fig. 3) , allowed pseudotyped particles to achieve higher transducing levels than wt S SARSpp (Fig. 6 ). This finding further supports the notion that ezrin's interaction with S negatively modulates entry, although we may not exclude the possibility that higher S incorporation observed in the case of SD8 SARSpp also contributes in increasing viral entry. Effects of truncations of S endodomain have been analyzed in several independent studies. Petit et al. have shown that a truncated S lacking the 8 C-terminal amino-acids, named T1247 in their study, was less efficient in mediating S-driven cell-cell fusion than wt S (34.01% of wt S) [17] . This was explained by an altered surface expression of S T1247 (79.15% of wt S). In another study by Giroglou et al., although low cell surface expression of SD8 was also documented in 293T cells, SD8 SARS-MLV pseudotyped particles could be produced and could transduce Vero cells ,10-fold more than wt S SARS-MLVpp [19] . In addition, deletion of the last C-terminal 17 amino acids increased S-mediated cell-cell fusion [17] and SD19 mutants were shown to be efficiently expressed at the cell surface of 293T pseudotyped particles producer cells and induced a 100-fold increase in transduction of Vero cells [19] . A study by Moore et al. has shown that a S protein variant with a deletion of the last Cterminal 27 amino-acids and addition of the eight most membrane-proximal residues of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein cytoplasmic domain (S-H2 in this study) induces better cell surface expression, incorporation into simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) pseudotyped particles and capacity to mediate transduction by SIVpp than wt S [18] . The authors concluded that the greater efficiency of transduction of S-H2 pseudotyped particles compared to wt S SARS-SIVpp was likely due to preferential incorporation of S-H2. Further truncations altering cysteine residues have resulted in decreased transduction levels [18, 19] and deficiencies in cell-cell fusion [14] . Interestingly, in our study we found that SD8 C1 SARSpp could transduce slightly more potently Vero E6 cells than wt S SARSpp (Fig. 6) . We have shown that SD8 C1 can no longer bind ezrin in vitro (Fig. 3) . SD8 C1 was better incorporated into HIVpp than wt S (3.9-fold difference). The higher incorporation level could be partly responsible for the enhancement of transduction. However, the contribution of the absence of ezrin binding cannot be excluded in the observed enhancement of SD8 C1 SARSpp entry. Our work indicates that, in addition to the levels of S incorporation into pseudotyped particles and S fusogenicity, binding to ezrin may also contribute to modulate the efficiency of S-mediated entry."", ""Expression of the dominant negative FERM domain of ezrin increases host cell susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV and SARSpp and S-mediated cell-cell fusion"": ""Expression of the dominant negative N-terminal FERM domain of ezrin in Vero E6 cells was used to investigate the consequences of ezrin function disruption on the host cell susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection and entry of SARSpp. Replication levels and rates of infection were similar for Vero E6 and Vero E6 cells expressing GFP-ezrin wt (Fig. 7B-C) . When the FERM domain of ezrin was expressed, cell susceptibility to infection was enhanced with either SARS-CoV or SARSpp ( Fig. 7 and 8 ), further indicating that ezrin's restricting role on SARS-CoV infection takes place at the entry step. We speculate that ezrin acts at the fusion stage, as cells expressing GFP-ezrin FERM were twice more susceptible to fuse with S-expressing HeLa cells than GFP or GFP-ezrin wt Vero E6 cells (Fig. 9) . Interestingly, in these experiments expression of GFPezrin wt did not inhibit infection or fusion. As ezrin is naturally abundantly expressed in the cells used in this study, moderate expression of GFP-ezrin wt has no effect simply because it does not change massively the overall cellular content of ezrin. In other experiments, we have observed that significant overexpression of GFP-ezrin wt was able to enhance SARSpp transduction (data not shown). We speculate that massive overexpression of GFP-ezrin wt has consequences on ezrin functions in the cell that can ultimately impact SARSpp entry. The use the dominant negative FERM domain or of siRNA appears to be more relevant to study the role of ezrin. The fact that the replication level measured by qRT-PCR was slightly lower in the clone expressing the FERM domain of ezrin than control cells at 24 hours post-infection (Fig. 7B) suggests that although ezrin restricts the rate of infection at early time points, its function may be important for later stages. Alternatively, cell fitness may be affected in FERM expressing cells, affecting virus replication rate. We have investigated the potential involvement of ezrin on viral release using the SARS S, M, N and E-containing virus-like (VLP) particle system developed in the laboratory [53] . While we could not detect ezrin at sites of VLP budding, we have found presence of ezrin in preparations of purified VLPs. However, this incorporation was S-independent and expression of ezrin FERM had no impact on release of VLPs (data not shown).Recent studies on influenza HA and baculovirus gp64 viral glycoprotein-induced fusion have revealed that while the initial pore formation step is mainly controlled by the fusion protein, the subsequent steps of widening of the pore is a complex, multi-step mechanism involving cell metabolism and components, in particular membrane-curvature generating proteins [54, 55] . Interestingly, it was shown that the actin cytoskeleton restricts the opening of the fusion pore, and disrupting the actin network enhances fusion pore widening [55] . In light of this, it would be interesting to study ezrin's role in the fusion pore expansion induced by SARS-CoV S, considering the role of ezrin as a key actin-membrane linker and its interaction with SARS-CoV S endodomain after the fusion pore opening.The present study has put to light an interaction between the SARS-CoV S endodomain and the plasma membrane-actin linker ezrin. Although direct evidence of the interaction occurring during early stages of SARS-CoV infection has yet to be demonstrated, our functional analysis reveals that ezrin has a limiting effect on SARS-CoV entry. Owing to topological constraints, we can put forward that ezrin binding to SARS-CoV S endodomain would occur during the fusion process, after the opening of the fusion pore. The findings that disruption of ezrin function enhances SARS-CoV S-dependent entry and S-mediated cell-cell fusion, would point towards a model in which ezrin scaffolds interactions with S endodomains, impose a limitation on membrane fluidity and act as a physical constraint restraining completion of fusion. The data shown here provides the basis for the establishment of a new mechanism of regulation by ezrin in the entry process of SARS-CoV."", ""Cell"": ""The African green monkey kidney Vero E6, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T, human cervix carcinoma HeLa cell lines (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), and HeLa-F5, which stably express ACE2 [10] , were used in this study."", ""Antibodies"": ""Rabbit polyclonal serum against the endodomain of SARS-CoV S was from Proscience (Poway, CA, USA).

""}",Ezrin Interacts with the SARS Coronavirus Spike Protein and Restrains Infection at the Entry Stage,"BACKGROUND: Entry of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and its envelope fusion with host cell membrane are controlled by a series of complex molecular mechanisms, largely dependent on the viral envelope glycoprotein Spike (S). There are still many unknowns on the implication of cellular factors that regulate the entry process. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using as bait the carboxy-terminal endodomain of S, which faces the cytosol during and after opening of the fusion pore at early stages of the virus life cycle. Here we show that the ezrin membrane-actin linker interacts with S endodomain through the F1 lobe of its FERM domain and that both the eight carboxy-terminal amino-acids and a membrane-proximal cysteine cluster of S endodomain are important for this interaction in vitro. Interestingly, we found that ezrin is present at the site of entry of S-pseudotyped lentiviral particles in Vero E6 cells. Targeting ezrin function by small interfering RNA increased S-mediated entry of pseudotyped particles in epithelial cells. Furthermore, deletion of the eight carboxy-terminal amino acids of S enhanced S-pseudotyped particles infection. Expression of the ezrin dominant negative FERM domain enhanced cell susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV and S-pseudotyped particles and potentiated S-dependent membrane fusion. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Ezrin interacts with SARS-CoV S endodomain and limits virus entry and fusion. Our data present a novel mechanism involving a cellular factor in the regulation of S-dependent early events of infection.",10.1371/journal.pone.0049566,Medline; PMC,PMC3504146,23185364.0,cc-by,2012-11-21,PLoS One,,,,18251837.0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23185364/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0049566,2012.0,paper

As its name implies Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is responsible for acute respiratory tract infections in chickens. Laying hens experience reduced production, eggshell abnormalities, and decreased internal egg quality. In addition to tracheal damage, some strains of IBV can cause renal lesions. The positive-sense viral genome 27.6 kb in length encodes at least ten open reading frames (ORFs) organized as follows: 5\u2032 UTR-1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-5b-N-3a-3\u2032UTR. ORFs 1a and 1b encode 15 non-structural proteins responsible for viral replication and pathogenesis. Four structural proteins including the spike glycoprotein (S), small membrane protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N) are encoded by mRNAs 2, 3, 4 and 6, respectively [1, 2] . The spike protein is post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2. The S1 subunit is the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Evolution in IBV is essentially associated with the sequences of the S1 glycoprotein, and the genetic diversity of IBV is principally screened by analysis of the S1 gene. Mutations in the S1 leads to the emergence of variant serotypes which do not confer complete cross-protection against each other [3] [4] [5] [6] . Among a large number of serotypes or variants emerged after the first documentation of IBV in 1931, Massachusetts 41 (M41) and 793/B serotypes have been expanded through the world and commercial vaccines are available against both serotypes providing a broad crossprotection against many different IBV types when used together [7] [8] [9] . Despite vaccination efforts, novel field IBVs continue to emerge; some antigenic variants may subsequently become dominant which makes prevention of IBV infections very challenging [10, 11] . Similar to what has been happening in Iranian poultry farms leading to unceasing IB outbreaks despite extensive vaccination. In this work, we focus on potential IBV variants escaping from vaccine-induced immunity."", ""Sample collection"": ""Tracheal swab samples were collected from 170 broiler flocks representing signs of the respiratory complex in 2017. Chickens had a history of vaccination against IBV (Massachusetts + 793/B type vaccines). The chicken farms were located in nine different provinces of Iran including Qazvin, Ardabil, Semnan, Kerman, Khurasan Razavi, Chahrmahal-E-Bakhtiari, Kurdistan, Qom, and Golestan. Geographical locations of these provinces are shown in Fig. 1 ."", ""RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis"": ""Ten tracheal swabs from each flock were pooled. Homogenized pooled samples were submitted for RNA isolation using RNA easy mini kit (Qiagen). The cDNA was synthesized using a RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific) [12] ."", ""Real-time PCR for IBV detection and RT-PCR for IBV Genotyping"": ""A previously designated Real-time PCR [13] was used for IBV detection targeting 5\u2032 UTR of the IBV genome. IBV positive samples were submitted to a nested PCR amplification with the aim of genotyping [12] .

The phylogenetic analysis revealed detected IBVs were divided into five major clusters (Fig. 2) . The distribution of prevalence rates in each province is depicted in Table 1 . IS-1494-like IBV was the most common type accounted for 85% of detected strains. The other types overall created a lower proportion; including 793/B having a prevalence of 7%, QX, and Mass with prevalence rates of 5% and 2%, respectively, and D274 with the incidence of 1% (Fig. 3) The sequence identity among IS/1494/06 IBV types detected in this "", ""Discussion"": ""Despite vaccination efforts, novel field IBVs continue to emerge in many parts of the world, leading to the dominance of some antigenic variants that makes prevention of IBV infections very challenging [10, 15] . Two independent studies have been dedicated to investigating the IBV epidemiology in Iran. The first one was carried out by Najafi et al. between 2014 and 2015 [16] , the second was done during 2015-17 [12] . Comparison of their results with the result obtained in this study showed the growing trend in IS/1494/06 IBV prevalence (Fig.6) .The circulation of such a high rate of IS/1494/06 genotype unrelated to the used vaccine strains declaring they originated from several sources. It is one of the most prevalent IBV genotypes in Middle East countries such as Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Saudi Arabia [17] . High sequence similarities among IS/1494/06 IBVs in Iran and those Fig. 2 . Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on partial S1 gene sequences of Iranian IBVs and selected reference strains. The percentages of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches IBVs obtained in this study are marked with black squares; other Iranian IBVs detected in recent years are shown by black diamonds. Table 2 Nucleotide homology between representatives from each distinct cluster and selected reference strains for partial S1 sequences. [19] , another possible reason is intense trade among Middle East countries and illegal movement of animals across borders. With much lower prevalence, 793/B was the second most predominant IBV type in this study. The 793/B serotype is one of IBV types used in our national vaccination program. As the method used in the present study could not differentiate field and vaccine strains, 793/B IBV type was expected to the 793/B vaccine strain use (Fig. 6) . In breeder and laying hens QX-type causes delayed the onset of production, poor peak in egg production, a high percentage of falselayers and poor quality of eggs [20] . The QX prevalence obtained in the present study was 5% which could reflect the efficacy of vaccination [21] . Although the prevalence is relatively low, the 2 to 10% fluctuation in its prevalence within a few last years and also increase the genetic distance between field and vaccine strains are worrying, since it is probably currently the IB variant of most concern for breeder/ layer flocks. At the stage that the QX live vaccines are not registered in Iran. D274, a Dutch strain was first isolated in 1979, reported to be serologically related to both A and B serotypes [22, 23] . Strains D207 and D3896 considered belonging to the same serotype as D274 [24] . D207 was isolated in samples collected between 1981 and 1983 in Britain [25] . D274 isolates were recovered from vaccinated and especially nonvaccinated broilers over a 10-year period from 1986 to 1995 in Belgium [26] . It was identified in Egypt (Egypt/D274/D/89) [27] . D274 was detected in Sweden, England and Russia in 1995, 1996 and 1998, respectively [28] . Several reports have been confirmed D274 presence in Western Europe from 2002 to 2006 [19, 29, 30] . D274 was not detected in the Middle East countries before 2005, its first report from Jordan [31] . After that in a six-year investigation of the dynamics of IBV, D274 was detected in Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, regarding the sequencing data, 62.50% of them identified as field and not vaccine strain [17] . D274 has been detected once in Iran using serological assays (personal communication); the present study reports the first molecular detection of D274 genotype. Since D274 is not included in any vaccine strains used in Iran, it is probably originated from neighboring countries. In addition to biosecurity practices, vaccination is usually needed to control IB. Selecting the proper vaccination schedule will be more complicated considering the existence of many IBV variants. It has been shown that vaccination with two antigenically distinct live-attenuated vaccines such as Mass and 793/B can result in a broad cross-protection against many different IBV types [15] . Awad et al. showed that administering combined live H120 and CR88 vaccines simultaneously at day-old followed by the CR88 vaccine at 14 dold gave more than 94% tracheal ciliary protection IS/1494/06. The other vaccination program, H120 at day-old followed by CR88 at 14 dold, the tracheal ciliary protection conferred was 80 percent from IS/ 1494/06-like [32] . Our experiment in which combination of H120 and 793/B provided better protection than using homologous H120-H120 vaccination strategy, while it was not still completely protect against Fig. 4 . Percent identity of partial S1 gene sequences of some IBVs from the current study to H120 vaccine strain. [11] . Mohammadi et al. showed a protective ability of the used vaccination program. The H120 at first day of age followed by 793/B at 14 d of age obtained 81% protection against QX variants circulating in Iran [34] .Ignoring some differences, Mass, and 793/B vaccination strategy seems more relevant in our conditions, in which we are not allowed to use D274, QX, and IS/1494/06 variant vaccines. Another challenging issue is about the application route and timing of vaccination. Vaccines are applied with spray route in a hatchery or the first day of age. Although it is preferred to apply the booster in the form of a spray, mass application through the water is often chosen as chicks grow. The main disadvantages of the latter route are inconsistencies of vaccine dosage depending on water consumption, and the potential for some birds to receive no vaccine at all. This study suggests a vaccination schedule using an initial combination of Mass + 793/B vaccine followed by a 793/B vaccine two weeks later, which appears to confer more protection than an only Mass type vaccine boosted by a 793/B vaccine and the continuing IBV surveillance necessary to make new approaches.

IS/1494/06 was showed to be dominant IBV type circulating in broiler farms with a significantly higher prevalence than other four genotypes.

Nevertheless, in many cases, patients undergoing intensive treatment experience severe side-effects, either immediately or even years after the therapy. It is well recognized that some anticancer drugs are gonadotoxic, with infertility now representing a major concern for women undergoing cancer treatments, particularly so for younger patients (Meirow et al., 2010) . The key basis for the adverse effects on the ovary is the limited supply of oocytes contained within the ovarian follicles, which are formed before birth. This population of primordial follicles represents a female's ovarian reserve. The reproductive lifespan of a woman ceases when the number of primordial follicles becomes too low (less than around a thousand), leading to the menopause (Wallace and Kelsey, 2010) . Insults and pathological circumstances affecting the ovary can precociously deplete this reserve, leading to premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) with loss of fertility and the consequences of estrogen deficiency.The severity of ovarian toxicity caused by the taxane class of chemotherapeutic agents has been difficult to determine, in part because they are usually administered in association with other drugs and other adjuvants (Han et al., 2009; P\u00e9rez-Fidalgo et al., 2010; Torino et al., 2012) . Docetaxel (DOC), a second generation taxane, represents one of the most powerful chemotherapeutic drugs against local or metastatic breast, non-small cell lung and ovarian cancer and displays a high level of radio-sensitizing activity (Gligorov and Lotz, 2004) . DOC triggers cells into a programmed cell death pathway, mainly by binding with the b-subunit of tubulin, thus stabilizing microtubules and inhibiting their depolymerization. This results in cell cycle arrest, followed by phosphorylation of bcl-2 and apoptosis (Subrata et al., 1997) . Taxanes can also directly change mitochondrial membrane permeability, ultimately activating caspases (Fabbri et al., 2006) . DOC plasma concentrations in patients are highly variable, with different regimens of 40 mg m 22 administered weekly or 100 mg m 22 administered every 3 weeks used clinically. Pharmacokinetic studies report a plasma concentration of 0.1-1.2 mM and maximum concentrations (C max ) ranging between 0.3 and 6.9 mM within 24 h post-treatment (Baker et al., 2004; Slaviero et al., 2004; Brunsvig et al., 2007) .There is some evidence from clinical studies that DOC increases reproductive impairment when administered in combination with other drugs (Martin et al., 2005; Han et al., 2009) and there is evidence in an animal model of loss of primordial follicles after treatment with the related drug paclitaxel (Gucer et al., 2001) . However, effects of DOC are particularly controversial, with other work showing that patients treated with taxanes restore normal menstrual cyclicity more frequently than those treated with other drugs (Minisini et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2010) . Ovarian damage has been difficult to assess directly, and most studies have used chemotherapy-induced amenorrhoea as a surrogate for POI, a method that does not allow detection of incomplete ovarian damage. Using a detailed assessment of ovarian function, we previously reported evidence for taxane-induced toxicity in women treated for early breast cancer (Anderson et al., 2006) .It is likely that each anticancer drug will affect ovarian tissue differently, according to its mechanism of action (Morgan et al., 2012) . Drug-specific damage therefore needs to be characterized to define toxicity, with the aim of then finding protective approaches. One possible protective strategy could be to target the ovary with a compound that antagonizes chemotherapy toxicity, but so far this approach has been explored only by laboratory studies. Such studies have investigated different molecular approaches, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate, the retrovirusmediated multidrug resistance gene and the c-Abl inhibitor imatinib (Morita et al., 2000; Gonfloni et al., 2009; Salih, 2011; Morgan et al., 2012) . As one example of this kind of protective approach, thyroid hormones have been hypothesized to minimize the impact of taxanes on ovarian functionality, due to their role on cell proliferation and apoptosis in ovarian somatic cells (Verga Falzacappa et al., 2009 , 2012 . To date, one report has shown that 3,5,3 \u2032 -triiodothyronine (T3) is able to counteract the apoptosis of rat ovarian GCs exposed to the taxane paclitaxel (Verga Falzacappa et al., 2012) .Here, a culture system of neonatal mouse ovaries has been used to investigate DOC-induced damage to the resting pool of primordial follicles and to the early stages of follicular development. This in vitro system has been demonstrated to be a reliable and physiological model for studying effects of compounds on folliculogenesis in a highly controlled environment (Morgan et al., 2013) . In addition, in order to explore potential protective strategies, the role of T3 supplementation has been investigated for its ability to prevent DOC-induced damage in the intact ovary."", ""Animals"": ""All experiments were approved by the University of Edinburgh's Local Ethical Review Committee and were carried out in accordance with UK Home Office regulations. C57Bl/J6 mice were housed in a 14 h light-10 h dark cycle, with food and beverage provided ad libitum."", ""Tissue culture"": ""Newborn mouse ovary culture was performed according to Morgan et al. (2013) . In brief, on the day of birth, female mice were sacrificed by decapitation and ovaries dissected out and placed in pre-warmed Leibovitz L-15 medium (Invitrogen, UK) supplemented with 3 mg ml 21 bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich Ltd, UK) and kept at 378C. Whole ovaries were transferred into a 24-well plate (Grenier Bio-one, Stonehouse, UK) containing a-Minimum Essential Medium (Invitrogen, UK) supplemented ith 3 mg ml 21 BSA, placed on floating polycarbonate membranes (Whatman Nucleopore Polycarbonate Membrane, Camlab Ltd, Cambridge, UK) and incubated in a 5%CO 2 atmosphere at 378C (Day 1). On the second day of culture (Day 2), medium was supplemented with 0.1% ethanol-vehicle (CONTROL) or with one of three Docetaxel concentrations (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd, UK): 0.1 mM (LOW-DOC), 1 mM (MID-DOC) or 10 mM (HIGH-DOC). Doses of DOC were chosen to cover the range of concentrations found in the plasma of patients undergoing cancer treatments (Baker et al., 2004; Brunsvig et al., 2007) . On Day 3, all ovaries were transferred into fresh control medium. Half of the medium was replaced on Day 5, with the culture continued to the end of Day 6. Previous work using this experimental paradigm has shown that this time frame supports the health of control cultures, and allows growth initiation of the majority of follicles (Morgan et al., 2013) . Intracellular location of cytochrome C was examined in control and HIGH-DOC treated ovaries. In each run of the cytochrome C experiment, four ovaries were dissected from mice, two placed in CONTROL and two in HIGH-DOC conditions. After 6 days in culture, pairs of ovaries were processed for western blotting as detailed below.In the T3 experiment, ovaries were cultured as above but exposed on Day 2 to: 0.1% ethanol-vehicle (CONTROL), 10 27 M of T3 (T3), 0.1 mM of DOC (LOW-DOC) or a combination of 10 27 M of T3 and 0.1 mM DOC (T3+LOW-DOC). T3 was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich Ltd (UK). The lower DOC dose was chosen because it resulted in a robust increase in the percentage of unhealthy follicles but with less extensive damage than the two higher doses. The concentration of 10 27 M T3 was chosen on the basis of a previous paper showing that this concentration of T3 is able to overcome paclitaxel-induced damage to GCs (Verga Falzacappa et al., 2012; Verga Falzacappa, personal communication) . Ovaries in the T3 and T3+LOW-DOC groups were also exposed to T3 during Days 3 -5, but not to DOC after Day 2. The culture finished at the end of Day 6. For each experiment, ovaries were processed at the end of the culture period for histology, western blotting or immunohistochemistry (IHC), as detailed below."", ""Follicle classification and quantification"": ""On Day 6 of culture, ovaries were fixed in Bouin's fluid and embedded in paraffin wax. Serial sections (5 mm thick) were collected and every sixth section stained with haematoxylin and eosin and photomicrographed (DMLB Leica microscope, Leica Microsystem Ltd, UK). Follicle counts were performed with the assessor blind to treatments and using ImageJ software. Total number of follicles per ovary was estimated from counts of follicles with a visible germinal vesicle in the section, with counts then corrected using the Abercrombie formula (Abercrombie, 1946) . Follicles were classified in accordance with Morgan et al. (2013) .

Exposure of ovaries to DOC led to a specific reduction in the number of primary follicles (Fig. 1A ) without a change in the overall follicle number. The number of primary follicles was significantly reduced when ovaries were exposed to DOC in a dose-dependent fashion ( Fig. 1A -iv). The total follicles number per ovary did not vary at LOW-DOC and MID-DOC, while a marked decrease was observed at HIGH-DOC compared with the number of follicles in the CONTROL group, but this was not statistically significant (P \u00bc 0.07; Fig. 1A -i). Similarly, the number of primordial and transitional follicles did not decrease significantly when exposed to DOC (Fig. 1A -ii and -iii)."", ""Docetaxel damages follicle health"": ""Follicle health was affected more markedly then follicle number (Fig. 1B) . In fact, despite the relatively good preservation of the total ovarian follicle population, a dramatic decrease in follicle quality was observed, with a significant increase in the percentage of unhealthy follicles even after exposure to the lowest concentration of DOC ( Fig. 1B-i) . When unhealthy follicles were further categorized within each developmental stage, primordial follicles did not show signs of damage ( Fig. 1A-ii) . In contrast, growing (transitional and primary) follicles were greatly affected by DOC treatment, with a significant increase in the percentage of unhealthy follicles observed (Fig. 1B-iii and -iv) . Although there was a lower percentage of unhealthy primary follicles in the HIGH-DOC than in the LOW-and MID-DOC groups, this may reflect the marked depletion of that follicle stage, as only 5 + 1 primary follicles were left in these ovaries (Fig. 1A-iv and B-iv) . Ovarian toxicity of docetaxel in neonatal mice Docetaxel primarily affects GCs of early growing folliclesIn order to analyse which follicle cell type was the principal target of DOC damage, the percentage of follicles with unhealthy oocyte only, GCs only or both oocyte and GCs (OO + GCs) was determined (Fig. 2) . When the total follicle population was considered, there was a significant increase in the percentage of follicles with unhealthy oocytes relative to CONTROL only in the HIGH-DOC group ( Fig. 2A-i) . In contrast, GCs were markedly affected by DOC exposure even at the lowest drug concentration: the percentage of unhealthy follicles because of unhealthy GCs relative to the total number of follicles significantly increased at all doses tested, compared with no follicles classified as unhealthy due to poor GCs in the CONTROL group ( Fig. 2A-ii) . The percentage of follicles categorized as unhealthy due to unhealthy oocytes and GCs (OO + GCs) was also significantly greater in the MID-and HIGH-DOC groups compared with CONTROL ( Fig. 2A-iii) . When each stage of follicle development was analysed separately, primordial follicles showed no signs of damage in response to drug treatment over that seen in CONTROL primordial follicles (Fig. 2B-i, B- ii, B-iii). In contrast, growing (transitional and primary) follicles were in most cases significantly affected by DOC treatment, exhibiting poor GC, or OO+GC health, even if not in a dose-response manner (Fig. 2B-ii, B-iii) . Overall, results indicate that the primary cell type affected by DOC exposure is the GCs of growing follicles, with significant increase in degeneration even at the lowest concentration. Growing follicles of ovaries exposed to LOW-DOC dose showed signs of pyknosis primarily localized to the GCs (Fig. 3A -D) ."", ""Docetaxel induces apoptosis of ovarian stromal and follicular cells"": ""The ability of DOC to induce activation of the intracellular apoptotic pathway in the mouse ovary was tested by analysing the expression of the following programmed cell death markers: CC3 (n \u00bc 5 each for CONTROL and LOW-and MID-DOC, n \u00bc 4 for HIGH-DOC) and CC8 (n \u00bc 4 for CONTROL and LOW-DOC, n \u00bc 6 for MID-and HIGH-DOC), both examined using IHC. In addition, western blotting was used to assess expression of Bax (n \u00bc 3 for all groups), release of Cytochrome C (CytC) from mitochondria into the cytosol (n \u00bc 5 for both CONTROL and HIGH-DOC groups) and cleavage of PARP (cPARP) (n \u00bc 5 for all groups). CC3 expression was analysed both by manual counting and also using a more automated system. Firstly, for manual counting, the number of follicles with oocyte and/or GCs that were CC3-positive was recorded and expressed relative to the number of follicles in the section, with follicle counts determined by numbers of MVH-expressing oocytes (Fig. 3C -F) . DOC treatment significantly increased the proportion of CC3-positive apoptotic follicles relative to CONTROL (Fig. 3G) . Secondly, for the semi-automated system, the CC3-expressing area of somatic (granulosa and stromal) cells within a section was measured and analysed relative to total section area; as with the manual counting, the area of apoptosis increased in all DOC-treated groups (Fig. 3H ). The degree of activation of programmed cell death of follicles detected by CC3 expression thus reflected the degree of damage observed by morphological observation after DOC treatment. Furthermore, the level of CC3 expression within the follicles of DOC-treated ovaries was comparable with its level in the somatic cells: in both cases CC3 increased 8-11 fold versus CONTROL. It is noteworthy that the matching of the outcomes in both systems confirms the reliability of this semi-automated system and for this reason, only the latter system was chosen to analyse CC8 expression (Fig. 4) . All treated groups showed an increase in CC8 levels in comparison with untreated tissue (Fig. 4A -D) , with the increase following a doseresponse pattern and significant at MID-and HIGH-DOC doses (Fig. 4E) . In order to further explore the DOC-induced apoptotic pathway, western blotting analysis for Bax, CytC and cPARP was performed (Fig. 5) . Bax expression significantly increased 3.3-fold (relative to b-actin) over CONTROL in the HIGH-DOC group (Fig. 5A-ii) . Exposure to HIGH-DOC also induced release of CytC from mitochondria into the cytosol, leading to a 3-fold decrease in the ratio of mitochondrial:cytosol CytC (Fig. 5B-ii) . PARP cleavage showed a significant increase of 3.6-fold (relative to expression of b-actin) only in the HIGH-DOC group (Fig. 5C-ii) ."", ""T3 does not protect ovarian follicles from Docetaxel-induced damage"": ""In order to test whether T3 plays a putative protective role against DOC damage, medium was supplemented with T3 in the presence (T3 + LOW-DOC, n \u00bc 10) or absence (T3, n \u00bc 8) of LOW-DOC, with data compared with CONTROL group (n \u00bc 7) or LOW-DOC alone (n \u00bc 6). T3 alone did not affect normal ovarian morphology, with the percentage of unhealthy follicles similar to the CONTROL group. As in the previous experiment (Fig. 1B-i) , LOW-DOC significantly increased the percentage of follicles classified as unhealthy (Fig. 6) . A similar degree of damage was obtained when LOW-DOC and T3 were added together (Fig. 6 ). There is, therefore, no indication that T3 is able to protect ovarian follicles from DOC-induced damage at the concentrations used here."", ""Discussion"": ""The potential to design protective agents and strategies to reduce ovarian toxicity from chemotherapy regimens requires detailed understanding of the affected cells and pathways involved. Using an in vitro mouse model we have shown that DOC directly impairs the early stages of ovarian follicle development, but does not directly affect the resting pool of primordial follicles. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GCs of growing follicles are the first cellular target of DOC-induced follicular damage, indicating that oocyte damage is indirect, and that DOC induces damage of somatic cells following a mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway. No protective effect of T3 was found.Results here showed that DOC induces loss of follicles in the very early stages of growth even at concentrations of DOC (0.1 mM), lower than that found in the plasma of cancer patients (Slaviero et al., 2004; Baker et al., 2004; Brunsvig et al., 2007) . This effect must be due either to decreasing numbers of follicles reaching the primary stage or increasing numbers dying soon after they reach the primary follicle stage. Moreover, exposure to these low concentrations of DOC severely impaired follicle health, with abnormal morphology seen in 30% of transitional follicles and .80% of primary follicles. This scenario became even more severe at drug concentrations in the higher range of plasma levels to be found in DOC-treated patients.Several groups have used in vivo and in vitro rodent models to test the effect of ovotoxic compounds which are used in human medicine (for example, Petrillo et al., 2011; Maiani et al., 2012) . The culture system used in the present study has been previously used in our laboratory to test the damage caused to the ovarian follicle population by other chemotherapeutic agents, including examination of the chemotherapy drug cisplatin that is considered to have moderate clinical ovotoxicity (Morgan et al., 2013) : in vitro exposure of ovaries to clinically relevant doses of cisplatin induced a similar degree of damage to that observed in the present study, in which ovaries were exposed to clinically relevant doses of DOC. Bearing in mind the need for caution in extrapolating results from an in vitro animal model to consideration of the effects of DOC on human patients, this does together indicate that chemotherapeutic doses of DOC may well induce moderate levels of ovarian toxicity: certainly, further examination of the effects of DOC on the fertility of younger female patients is warranted.The limited information about the impact of DOC on patient fertility that is available largely refers to the length of temporary, or time until permanent, amenorrhoea, which are not good indicators of partial ovarian damage (Berliere et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2010) . Furthermore, within the studies examining the degree of amenorrhoea following DOC treatment, some have suggested a marked effect of DOC (Martin et al., 2005; Han et al., 2009) , while others have not (Minisini et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2010) , although a more detailed analysis indicated that taxane administration in combination with other chemotherapy agents does add to the treatment's ovarian toxicity (Anderson et al., 2006) . To the best of our knowledge, no data are available from animal models to determine detrimental effects of DOC on fertility. There are some in vivo studies testing the effect of the first generation taxane, paclitaxel, on primordial follicles in adult mice, but these are contradictory. Injection of 7.5 mg/kg of paclitaxel (considered a high dose) in a single or repeated administration, decreased primordial follicle count 1 week after drug exposure (Gucer et al., 2001; Yucebilgin et al., 2004) , while in contrast, another in vivo study used repeated administration of paclitaxel (5 mg/kg) on adult rats, but found no reduction of follicle counts at any pre-antral development stage, with only antral follicles affected (Tarumi et al., 2009) . Mature oocytes exposed to paclitaxel undergo a delay of nuclear maturation and defective spindle formation, leading to aneuploidy (Mailhes et al., 1999) .Women undergoing chemotherapy usually receive several treatments over a period of months. As human ovarian follicles take 6 months to develop from the dormant state to the fully grown ovulatory follicles ( McGee and Hsueh, 2000) , each treatment will affect a range of follicles at different developmental stages. The major concern about ovarian damage is if it markedly affects the ovarian reserve of resting primordial follicles, as this can lead to POI. Primordial follicle loss could result from a direct effect of damage to the primordial pool, or could be an indirect effect, where the decrease in primordial follicle numbers is through an increased rate of growth initiation due to a major loss of growing follicles, a process termed the burnout model . Although some authors consider mature follicles to be more sensitive to chemotherapy than small follicles (Nicosia et al., 1985; Gucer et al., 2001) , damage specifically to the small number of follicles that are at the late antral stage at any one time point should have, at most, a minor impact on long-term fertility. The present results demonstrated that immature, early growing follicles are severely affected by DOC, in both their number and quality, even at low DOC concentrations. Since early growing follicles are present in large numbers, marked damage to this follicle pool could well result in follicular burnout (Kalich-Philosoph et al., 2013; Morgan et al., 2013) . The burnout model is also in accordance with the observations of others using high doses of paclitaxel on mice in vivo (Gucer et al., 2001; Yucebilgin et al., 2004) . In the present study, primordial follicle number did not decrease significantly, but a negative trend was observed at the highest DOC concentration. This may reflect the particular characteristic of the present model, as the primordial follicle pool in mouse is not completely formed at birth and the short duration of the experiment may not allow full elaboration of secondary effects.Given that the oocyte and somatic cells of the follicle are mutually interdependent, damage to the latter would inevitably affect the health of the oocyte as well. In addition, the loss of stromal integrity could Aii, Bii and Cii: Densitometric analyses of proteins, expressed as relative to that of b-actin (Aii, Cii) or as a ratio of mitochondrial: cytosol expression (Bii). Bax and cPARP expression increased significantly only when ovaries were exposed to HIGH-DOC. HIGH-DOC treatment also induced release of Cytochrome C from the mitochondria into the cytosol. For Bax, a total of six ovaries were used for each treatment group in three independent experiments and Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn post hoc tests were applied. For CytC, a total of 10 ovaries were used for each treatment group in five independent experiments and a paired t-test was used. For cPARP, a total of 10 ovaries were used for each treatment group in five independent experiments and Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn post hoc tests were applied. Data are mean + SEM.

P , 0.05 (*). lead to subsequent follicle damage. The present study showed that DOC severely affects early growing follicles, initially damaging GCs, with oocyte damage becoming apparent only after GCs were compromised. Our data also suggest that DOC negatively impacts on stromal components of the ovary, as has been seen from other chemotherapy drugs. A timeline study of the damage produced by doxorubicin, an anthracycline agent used in cancer treatment, revealed that, in the mouse, stromal tissue is the first target, probably due to its contact with the circulatory system (Roti Roti et al., 2012) . Furthermore, human ovarian cortex of cancer patients showed damage to blood vessels and fibrosis, suggesting that the loss of stroma integrity could lead to follicle damage (Meirow et al., 2007) . The explanation for the DOC-induced damage probably lies in the principal mechanism of action of this group of chemotherapeutic drugs: taxanes promote microtubule assembly and inhibit their polymerization, leading to mitotic arrest and apoptosis. Mitotically active cells, such as GCs and stromal cells, are, for that reason, more likely to be vulnerable to DOC damage than oocytes. Oocyte death would follow as a downstream consequence of GC damage and loss of oocyte-GC connections (Thomson et al., 2010) . This DOC mechanism of action may also explain the absence of a dose-response pattern of damage in much of the data presented here: the plateau of damage is perhaps already reached at the lowest concentration able to perturb the cell cycle in dividing GCs within activated-early growing follicles and stroma cells at the time of DOC exposure. Thus, if the ovary was exposed to repeated doses rather than higher doses, this would affect an increasing number of cells subsequently entering into the G2/M phase, and could well lead to more wide spread damage. Similarly, a cytometric study using a bladder cancer cell line (HT1376, American Type Culture Collection line) failed to find a dose-response relationship after 1 h of DOC treatment, while 24 h treatment induced dosedependent cytostatis (Fabbri et al., 2006) .Here, we show that DOC activates the intrinsic, mitochondrialdependent apoptotic pathway in the somatic compartment of the ovary, inducing expression of key cell death markers (for schematic, see Fig. 7 ). Pro-caspase 8 is thought to be the first intracellular cysteine protease activated upon binding of a cell death receptor (Manabe et al., 2004) . GCs then activate the intrinsic, type II mitochondrialdependent apoptotic cascade, subsequently interacting with proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bax (Sai et al., 2012) . Bax is a pro-apoptotic protein that plays a principal role in the mitochondria involvement in cell death. It undergoes conformational changes, integrating into the mitochondrial membrane and hence disrupting its membrane potential. That in turn induces an increase in the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane, with a consequent release of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol (Liu et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2010; Khan et al., 2014) . Cytochrome C activates the downstream caspases, including effector caspases such as caspase 3, which in turn leads to cleavage of the nuclear substrate PARP, inactivating its ability to support DNA repair.In the longer term, it may be possible to develop protective measures against the gonadotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents. The proposed protection exerted by thyroid hormone (T3) was investigated here. Thyroid hormones are involved in the development and functionality of the reproductive system, with both hypo-and hyperthyroidism associated with subfertility (Stavreus-Evers, 2012). T3 has been proposed to prevent paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in a rat GC line (Verga Falzacappa et al., 2012) . The present studies show that the same dose of T3 was unable to prevent the ovarian damage induced by a low dose of DOC. DOC and paclitaxel do differ: DOC binds tubulin with higher affinity than paclitaxel and is capable of direct induction of apoptosis via bcl-2 phosphorylation (Gligorov and Lotz, 2004) . Nonetheless, the discrepancy between our data and the results of Verga Falzacappa et al. (2012) could instead be due to the markedly different experimental paradigms used: we suggest that the organ culture system utilized here, where follicles are maintained intact and able to develop intact, as in vivo, is much more physiological than a GC line. While DOC dose was representative of the lowest doses found in serum samples of treated cancer patients, the T3 concentration used here (10 27 M) and in Verga Falzacappa et al. (2012) is almost 30 times higher than the serum concentration of T3 in healthy people and 8 times that in patients with thyrotoxicosis (Sterling et al., 1969) .In conclusion, the present study in mice shows clear evidence of ovarian toxicity of DOC at clinically relevant concentrations. The model used does not allow analysis of effects on later stages of follicle growth, but demonstrates effects on the stages highly relevant to longterm fertility, namely that of early growing follicles. DOC was demonstrated here to cause loss of primary follicles, but with no evidence of direct effects on primordial follicles. Primordial follicles could however be the site of secondary effects, with increased activation and thus premature depletion.""}","Docetaxel induces moderate ovarian toxicity in mice, primarily affecting granulosa cells of early growing follicles","Advances in cancer therapy have focused attention on the quality of life of cancer survivors. Since infertility is a major concern following chemotherapy, it is important to characterize the drug-specific damage to the reproductive system to help find appropriate protective strategies. This study investigates the damage on neonatal mouse ovary maintained in vitro for 6 days, and exposed for 24 h (on Day 2) to clinically relevant doses of Docetaxel (DOC; low: 0.1 µM, mid: 1 µM, high: 10 µM). Furthermore, the study explores the putative protective action exerted by Tri-iodothyronine (T3; 10(−7) M). At the end of culture, morphological analyses and follicle counts showed that DOC negatively impacts on early growing follicles, decreasing primary follicle number and severely affecting health at the transitional and primary stages. Poor follicle health was mainly due to effects on granulosa cells, indicating that the effects of DOC on oocytes were likely to be secondary to granulosa cell damage. DOC damages growing follicles specifically, with no direct effect on the primordial follicle reserve. Immunostaining and western blotting showed that DOC induces activation of intrinsic, type II apoptosis in ovarian somatic cells; increasing the levels of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 8, Bax and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, while also inducing movement of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol. T3 did not prevent the damage induced by the low dose of DOC. These results demonstrated that DOC induces a gonadotoxic effect on the mouse ovary through induction of somatic cell apoptosis, with no evidence of direct effects on the oocyte, and that the damaging effect is not mitigated by T3.",10.1093/molehr/gau057,PMC,PMC4172173,25080441.0,cc-by,2014-07-30,Mol Hum Reprod,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4172173/,2014.0,paper

This dataset was collected using a 300 kV microscope, as opposed to a 200 kV one, and was over twice as large as that previously analysed (Namy et al., 2006) . The contrast transfer function (CTF) was determined per micrograph using CTFIT (Ludtke et al., 1999) and corrected by phase flipping with the program Applyctf followed by combination of corrected images that had different defocuses (EMAN; Ludtke et al., 1999 ). An initial reconstruction, with a resolution of 17.6\u00c5, was generated by reference-based alignment and reconstruction using our previous model of 80S SL (Namy et al., 2006 ). This initial model was refined using reference based methods with correlation coefficient-based particle selection calculated over the P-site tRNA, as defined by a spherical mask. The refinement process was iterated six times, whereupon the resolution had reached 13.6\u00c5 and incorporated 24,738/38,720 particles. The resolution was assessed by Fourier shell correlation and used the FSC=0.5 criterion for resolution determination ( Figure S1A ).We note that for the 80S SL dataset, as for the 80S PK dataset and its subclasses, the numbers of particles analysed are similar to several recently-reported cryo-EM studies. Examples include the structure of an 80S-EF-2 transition state ribosome that used 28,842 particles (Sengupta et al., 2008) ; a set of reconstructions of the 40S small subunit incorporating ~30,000 particles each (Passmore et al., 2007) ; a 70S-SecY complex reconstruction with ~38,000 particles (M\u00e9n\u00e9tret et al., 2007) ; and the structure of a spontaneously-arisen A/P hybrid state based on 63,359 particles (Juli\u00e1n et al., 2008) -our hybrid state structures are based on 64,413 particles (see below).Data analysis for the PK-stalled ribosome 64,413 particles were excised using Boxer (EMAN program suite; Ludtke et al., 1999) with a combination of automatic and manual particle picking. The dataset used was over four times the size of that previously analysed and as above was collected using a 300 kV microscope rather than a 200 kV one. The CTF was determined and corrected as for the 80S SL sample above. After a few rounds of reference-based refinement starting from a previouslydetermined 80S PK reconstruction (Namy et al., 2006) in Spider (operations AP SH and BP RP; Frank et al., 1996) , the reconstruction converged displaying a bent tRNA, and quite weak EF2 density (Main text Figure 1A , 1B). The resolution of the map could not be improved beyond 16.7\u00c5 (which was also the resolution of our previously-determined 80S PK complex structure). This led us to hypothesise that the particle population was heterogeneous in composition, with higher occupancy of tRNA than EF-2. To examine particle heterogeneity, we created an omit map by electronically removing EF-2, tRNA and pseudoknot density from our pseudoknot-stalled ribosome using a spherical mask for the tRNA and tubular masks for the pseudoknot and EF-2. This model served for a round of reference-based alignment and reconstruction using Spider, as above. As shown in Main text Figure 2C (lower panel) weaker density, and therefore lower occupancy, was found for EF-2 compared to tRNA, which had strong density and clearly was in a bent conformation as previously observed. As it was observed in the context of an omit map calculation, this bent hybrid-state conformation of the A/P tRNA in the pseudoknot-stalled ribosome is further confirmed, similar to the way that the presence of an antigen peptide in a major histocompatibility complex groove confirms a successful molecular replacement solution in crystallography (Stewart-Jones et al., 2005) . Based on our omit map observations we sorted our particle image dataset into three subsets using multi-reference supervised classification (Allen et al., 2005; Gilbert et al., 2007) : 80S Apo , 80S PK-tRNA and 80S PK-tRNA-EF-2 . To do this, we generated three models. For the 80S Apo subset we used the 80S Apo reconstruction determined previously (Namy et al., 2006) , for the 80S PK-tRNA-EF-2 subset we used the 80S PK reconstruction determined previously (Namy et al., 2006) , and for the 80S PK-tRNA subset we again used our previously-determined stalled complex, but with density arising from EF-2 computationally set to background level. These three models were then used in multi-reference reprojection-based alignment of the data and the whole dataset of 80S PK images sorted by correlation coefficient following alignment, using spherical or generous-threshold masks to focus the correlation calculation on the regions of the images occupied by PK, tRNA and EF-2. Spherical masks were used for the pseudoknot and tRNAs, and a generously-thresholded tubular mask for EF2 were computed using the program GAP (Grimes et al., 1998; Gilbert et al., 2004) assisted by Chimera software (Pettersen et al., 2004) . We thus minimised model bias deriving from selection of particles for reconstruction based on density within masks having the same form as the molecules for which we were searching (Penczek et al. 2006 ). The sorted particles and their corresponding alignment parameters were used to generate three new reconstructions (80S Apo , 80S PK-tRNA and 80S PK-tRNA-EF-2 ) which were used again to align the whole dataset and so select particle images for the three subsets; this scheme was iterated 5 times. When we were confident that realistic subclassification of the particle images had been obtained, we refined the 80S PK-tRNA and 80S PK-tRNA-EF-2 subsets over four more iterations, using multi-referencebased reconstruction with correlation coefficient-based particle selection, to resolutions of 15.3\u00c5 for 80S PK-tRNA-EF-2 and 14.9 \u00c5 for 80S PK-tRNA . The final image distribution was 19,705 images to the 80S Apo subset, 20,215 to 80S PK-tRNA-EF-2 and 24,494 to 80S PK-tRNA . The 80S Apo reconstruction was not refined subsequent to the final subclassification since our previous 80S Apo structure is superior, coming from a homogeneous 80S Apo sample preparation. As for the 80S SL structure, all resolutions were estimated by Fourier shell correlation ( Figure S1A )."", ""Choice of display contour"": ""We chose our contour for map display using the atomic model for a mammalian ribosome built on the basis of a canine ribosome reconstruction at 8.7\u00c5 resolution (Chandramouli et al., 2008) . As shown in Figure S1B , at the resolution achieved in our maps the grooves in RNA helices are visible, demonstrating visually the detail provided by the structure."", ""Structure Factor scaling by Guinier analysis"": ""The structure factor amplitudes from reconstructions determined from cryo-EM data are attenuated, as resolution increases, by the microscope's envelope function and by computational processing (Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003) . To ameliorate this we computed thermal B factors, after Rosenthal and Henderson (Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003) , using Guinier analysis and then applied them, negatively, to the reconstructions. For each of the maps spherically averaged structure factor intensities were calculated using the map analysis program WellMAP (J.F.F. and R.J.C.G., manuscript in preparation). Then, thermal B factors in the data were extracted by fitting a line to the Wilson scattering regime, below 10\u00c5, where the slope determines the B factor applied to each reconstruction (Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003) . The 80S SL reconstruction was found to have a B factor of 240 \u00c5 2 , the 80S PK-tRNA-EF-2 190 \u00c5 2 , and the 80S PK-tRNA 210 \u00c5 2 . These thermal B factors were applied, negatively, to each reconstruction, again in WellMAP. The plots by which they were determined are shown in Figure S1C ."", ""Fitting of atomic models"": ""We used the atomic model of the canine 80S ribosome (Chandramouli et al., 2008) , RCSB-PDB IDs 2ZKQ and 2ZKR, to fit the ribosome EM density, EF-2 from the yeast 80S-EF-2 model (ID 1S1H) (Spahn et al., 2004) to fit the EF-2 density and yeast phenylalanine tRNA (PDB ID 1EVV; Jovine et al., 2000) to fit the tRNAs. Each model was manually fitted into reconstructed density with O (Jones et al., 1991) and refined using URO (Navaza et al., 2002) . The tRNAs and EF-2 were fit as single rigid bodies while the 40S (2ZKQ) and 60S (2ZKR) subunit fits were further refined as separate rigid bodies. Small subunit regions protein RACK1 and expansion segment ES6 part I, and large subunit regions protein L12 and ES7, ES9, ES15 and ES19 were treated in this way. In the case where no suitable density was found for a feature of the model it was removed. The caption for Figure S2 lists the removed model segments. For the density arising from EF2 associated with tRNA, the tRNA was fit first, due to its highly distinctive density, allowing us to define more easily the molecular envelope of EF-2. As the tRNA and EF2 have undergone significant conformational changes their fits were refined after rigid-body alignment using NMFF (Tama et al., 2003; using the 20 lowest modes and a maximum displacement of 1\u00c5 per iteration to minimize stereochemical perturbations. After NMFF fitting we performed 10 cycles of RefMac5 (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 (1994)) structure idealization. The tRNA fits are shown in Figure 4C of the main text and in Figure S5A for the two PK-stalled tRNAs, for clarification. In Figure S5B -D we show the normal modes-assisted fit compared to the structure of EF-2 complexed with sordarin and the previous rigid body fit (Namy et al., 2006) . The conformation uncovered by normal modes-guided fitting, like the rigid-body fit, reveals that domains I, II and G' superimpose well with the crystal structure of yeast eEF2 complexed with sordarin ( Figure S5B ). This is to be expected given that these domains within the EF-2-sordarin complex superimpose well on Apo EF-2 and seem to be structurally conserved (J\u00f8rgensen et al. 2003) . However, the ~90\u00b0 rotation of domains III-V about domains I, II and G' discovered in the normal modes-assisted fit (Supplementary Figure 5C ) is greater than the twist modelled previously without them (Namy et al., 2006) , where an additional rotation of ~45\u00b0 about domain IV, with respect to EF-2-sordarin, and a small translation towards the P site, were inferred ( Figure S5D ). Our new model illustrates good packing between domains I-G' and domains III-V, whereas our previous model had these regions slightly detached; however the key point is that both models reveal domain IV in contact with the tRNA (Figures S5C and S5D) . Given the improved density to which we are able to fit EF-2, the assistance of normal modes, and the resulting better molecular packing within the fitted EF-2, this represents an improved model of EF-2 bound to a ribosome and caught in the process of translocation.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,paper

We report on the first wave of seroprevalence surveys relying upon on household probabilistic samples of 133 large sentinel cities in Brazil, including 25,025 participants from all 26 states and the Federal District. Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, assessed using a lateral flow rapid test, varied markedly across the cities and regions, from below 1% in most cities in the South and Center-West regions to up to 25% in the city of Breves in the Amazon (North) region. Eleven of the 15 cities with the highest seroprevalence were located in the North, including the six cities with highest prevalence which were located along a 2,000 km stretch of the Amazon river. Overall seroprevalence for the 90 cities with sample size of 200 or greater was 1.4% (95% CI 1.3-1.6). Extrapolating this figure to the population of these cities, which represent 25% of the country population, led to an estimate of 760,000 cases, as compared to the 104,782 cases reported in official statistics. Seroprevalence did not vary significantly between infancy and age 79 years, but fell by approximately two-thirds after age 80 years. Prevalence was highest among indigenous people (3.7%) and lowest among whites (0.6%), a difference which was maintained when analyses were restricted to the North region, where most indigenous people live.

Different control programs aimed to decrease the impact of the disease have been instrumented in many countries. Although the rate of success has been highly variable, it has become evident that a tight control of dog infections is the key element to arrest the life cycle of the parasite. This has created a demand for reliable diagnostic tests for canine echinococcosis as a tool to obtain epidemiological baseline information and help in the surveillance of hydatid control [2] [3] [4] [5] . However, accurate diagnosis of dog infection is complex and challenging, and other than careful necropsy of dogs, there is no perfect gold standard [6] .Parasitological examination of eggs is unsafe and not very useful because E. granulosus are morphologically difficult to distinguish from other taeniae eggs, and appear late (after the first month) of infection. Traditionally, screening of dogs for E. granulosus has been done by arecoline purgation, followed by examination of the purge for parasites by trained personnel. The method is highly specific, but it is tedious, biohazardous, unpopular among dog owners, and its sensitivity is modest, particularly when the parasite burden is low and bowel evacuation is incomplete [7, 8] . As an alternative, different laboratory tests for ante-mortem diagnosis of canine echinococcosis have been developed, including detection of antibodies in serum, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of parasite DNA and immunological detection of antigens (coproantigens) in fecal samples. Different studies have been carried out to explore the potential use of dog serology to diagnose the disease. However, the systemic immune response to the parasite is poor and consequently the sensitivity attained is also low [4] . Parasite DNA excreted with eggs, proglottids or cells has been detected in fecal specimens by PCR amplification using specific primers derived from mitochondrial DNA [9, 10] . The method has provided the high specificity of PCR, but due to the presence of inhibitors the DNA extraction procedure is cumbersome and the technique requires expensive reagents and specialized laboratories [11] . In addition, the pre-patent period of the infection, when there is no egg production, is a critical time-window that challenges the sensitivity of the test. Introduced at the beginning of the 1990's, the detection of parasite antigens in fecal samples by immunoassays became a widely accepted diagnostic test [12, 13] . The major attractive features of the method include its simplicity, the possibility of detecting parasite components even in the prepatent period, and the fact that the target antigens (coproantigens) are highly stable. Samples can be collected in 1% of 40% formaldehyde and kept at room temperature for extended periods of time, facilitating the logistics of large-scale studies in remote areas [7, [14] [15] [16] . The study of a large group of infected dogs necropsied at the end of the pre-patent period demonstrated a superior sensitivity for the copro-ELISA (83%), when compared to copro-PCR (26%) or arecoline purgation (43 and 77% after one or two doses, respectively). Most failures to detect positive infected dogs occurred when the number of worms was less than one hundred [5] .Despite its proven utility and the numerous reports of copro-ELISA developments, the availability of commercial or homemade tests is often a major obstacle to the implementation and evaluation of echinococcosis control programs. The need to overcome this difficulty has been recognized as an early goal of the Southern Cone Sub-Regional Project on Cystic Echinococcosis Control and Surveillance: Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay, and PAHO (Pan American Health Organization), a joint and collaborative effort to battle the disease in the region. In this framework, we have developed an immunoassay for E. granulosus copro-antigen detection under the premise that in addition to performing with high standards of proven sensitivity and specificity, it had to be robust, standardized and developed in a kit format to be available for its use in regional programs for the control of the disease."", ""Ethics statements"": ""All activities involving animals were performed with special care to establish high standards of biosafety and assure animal welfare.

Dogs were purchase from local suppliers and maintained on commercial dog food and water ad libitum. Nineteen fecal samples (N1-N19), corresponding to non-infected dogs, were collected two days after deworming. Then, ten dogs (identified as P1-P10) were infected orally with 5,000-150,000 viable (.80%) protoscoleces from ovine fertile hydatid cysts. Two additional dogs (identified as Th1 and Th2) were infected orally with 1 and 3 larvae of Taenia hydatigena, respectively. Parasite material was obtained from sheep slaughter in local abattoirs in Paysand\u00fa, Uruguay. Stool samples from each dog were collected daily during the experimental period, at the end which (27-30 days post-infection (dpi)), the animals infected with E. granulosus were euthanized for necropsy diagnosis by intramuscular injection of acepromazine maleate (0.11 mg/kg) and ketamine (20 mg/kg) (Laboratorio Holliday, Argentina), following by an intravenous overdose of sodium thiopental (Laboratorio Crusur Vet, Uruguay). The dogs infected with T. hydatigena were purged at 70 dpi with arecoline bromhydrate (Crescent Chemical Co. Inc., New York, USA), following by treatment with anti-parasitic drugs. Three additional samples from dogs experimentally infected with E. granulosus (26 dpi) and two with T. hydatigena (about 55 dpi) from previous studies [14, 16] were obtained as a kind gift from Dr. Carlos Carmona. In addition, 85 unwanted dogs from the province of Chubut, Argentina, and 11 unwanted dogs from Junin, Peru, were euthanized following the procedure described above, and the small intestines were removed post mortem, opened longitudinally and examined directly for the presence of parasites following the recommendations of the WHO/OIE [17] . All activities were performed following the local legislation and the International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals (http://www.cioms.ch/)."", ""Preparation of fecal samples"": ""Stool samples from each dog were collected daily during the experimental infection period, or from the rectum upon necropsy, in 1% of 40% formaldehyde, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), in a 1:4 v/v ratio.

[16] . "", ""Author Summary"": ""Cystic echinococcosis, caused by infection with the larval stage of the Echinococcus granulosus tapeworm, is a lifethreatening zoonosis of worldwide distribution. The adult worm parasitizes the small intestine of dogs, which become infected after eating offal of an animal contaminated with the parasite, and releases eggs into the environment that can be accidentally ingested by domestic animals or humans, maintaining the life cycle of the parasite. Deworming of dogs is a major component of control programs, and simple and reliable methods are needed to monitor the base-line infection in the canine population. The lack of these tests was recognized as a major obstacle to the PAHO effort to control the disease in South America. This paper describes the development of a diagnostic assay that detects parasite antigens in dog feces. The key component is a monoclonal antibody carefully selected to attain high levels of sensitivity and specificity, which were established with a large panel of field fecal samples obtained from animals diagnosed by necropsy. Several aspects of the long-term stability of the test were optimized to facilitate its shelf-life and transference to other laboratories.unit with an YM-10 membrane (Millipore, USA), followed by dialysis against PBS. E. granulosus somatic antigen (Sm) was obtained by sonication of adult parasites in PBS supplemented with ULTRA Protease Inhibitor Tablets (Roche, Indianapolis) on ice, centrifugation and filtration (0.22 mm). Antigens from T. hydatigena were similarly prepared. Protein content was determined using a BCA kit (Pierce, Rockford, Illinois)."", ""Polyclonal antibody production"": ""To prepare polyclonal antibodies, 100 mg of Sm or E/S antigens were dissolved in 250 ml of PBS and vigorously mixed with 250 ml of Freund's Complete Adjuvant (Pierce, Illinois) to form a thick emulsion. This emulsion was then injected subcutaneously into several points on the back of New Zealand white rabbits. After 4 and 8 weeks, the animals were immunized intramuscularly with additional doses of 100 mg of antigen emulsified in Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant. Ten days after the final booster the animals were bled. The IgG fraction was prepared by precipitation of the sera with ammonium sulfate, affinity purified on protein G agarose (Amersham, Uppsala, Sweden), and kept at 220uC until used."", ""Selection of MAb CPR39"": ""For monoclonal antibody (MAb) preparation, Balb/c mice were primed intraperitonally with 40 mg of E. granulosus Sm or E/S antigen in Freund's complete adjuvant, and boosted after 3 and 6 weeks with the corresponding antigen using Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Three days after the last booster mice were sacrificed and the splenocytes fused with SP2/0 cells using standard procedures. Cultures producing MAbs reactive with the corresponding antigen were selected by ELISA. We initially performed a fusion experiment using mice immunized with alternate doses of E/S and Sm antigens, and additional selection in a sandwich format using fecal samples. MAb CPR39 was selected due to its convenient isotype and performance."", ""Selection of MAb Eg9"": ""Several fusion experiments were performed to produce a large panel of monoclonal antibodies. The screening of the monoclonal antibodies was initially performed as described before, and then each of the double-positive supernatants (13 clones) was tested in a sandwich format in combination with the different polyclonal antibodies. However, this time instead of using fecal samples from heavily infected dogs, each supernatant was tested against the following: i) a negative sample from a non-infected dog, ii) a sample collected from a low-burden dog at 28 dpi (dog P9, 74worms), iii) a sample from a heavily infected dog taken at an early stage (10 dpi) of the pre-patent period (dog P8, 3459 worms), and iv) a sample from dog Th2 taken at 56 dpi that was positive in the CPR39 copro-ELISA. Out of this complex screening clone MAbEg9, in combination with polyclonal antibody PAbC4 (prepared from a rabbit immunized with E/S), was chosen because this antibody pair produced high signals with samples (ii) and (iii), and low readings with samples (i) and (iv)."", ""SDS-PAGE and Western blot"": ""Parasite preparations were resolved by SDS-PAGE 12% under reducing conditions and then transferred onto nitrocellulose sheets (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA). The nitrocellulose was blocked with 3% non-fat milk powder in PBS 1 h at 37uC and was incubated for 1 h at 37uC with a 1:500 dilution of the rabbit antisera in PBS containing 0.05% of tween 20 (PBS-T), 3% non-fat milk, or directly with the culture supernatants of the MAbs antibodies. The membranes were then incubated for 1 h at 37uC with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated to anti-rabbit IgG or antimouse IgG (Pierce) (diluted 1/2500). After extensive washing, a substrate solution containing 5-Bromo-4-Chloro-39-Indolylphosphate p-Toluidine salt (BCIP) and Nitro-Blue Tetrazolium Chloride (NBT) was added according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma)."", ""Copro-ELISA assay"": ""Five mg/mL of polyclonal IgG (100 mL/well) (PAb CG10 or PAbC4 for the MAb CPR39 or MabEg9 copro-ELISA, respectively) was dispensed into microtitration plates (Greiner, Germany) and incubated overnight at 4uC. The plates were then blocked with 5% non-fat milk (PBS) and washed with PBS-T. Alternatively, the plates were further treated with PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 5% sucrose, 0.02% sodium azide, flapped repeatedly against adsorbent paper, dried in a 40% relative humidity chamber for 4 h, and kept in sealed aluminum foil bags containing adsorbent packets (Sigma) until used. Samples were analyzed in triplicates, after a 1:2 dilution in PBS; 100 mL/well were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, the wells washed and loaded (100 mL/well) with a 1:50 dilution of the MAb supernatants and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the wells were incubated (1 h "", ""Parasite extraction and antigen preparation"": ""Upon necropsy at 27-30 dpi, 9 of the experimentally infected dogs P1-P10 dogs harbored E. granulosus worms. The number of worms recovered from each dog varied widely, from 74 to 8,500, and showed no correlation with the initial number of protoescoleces used for infection. No other parasites were observed in addition to the E. granulosus worms. Adult worms (typically less than 1 m long) were recovered from dogs Th1 and Th2 infected with T. hydatigena. After careful washing, the recovered parasites were kept in culture to prepare excretion/secretion antigens, or were sonicated as described to obtain somatic antigens. The SDS-PAGE analysis of these antigens is shown in figure 1A ; a protoescoleces extract was also included as a reference antigen. All preparations possessed a complex composition and the SDS-PAGE profile did not reveal any obvious similarities among the individual components of the different preparation."", ""Characterization of antibodies to worm antigens"": ""Initially, the reactivity of polyclonal antibody PAbCGB10 raised against the Sm antigen was characterized, figure 1B . There was a strong response to a large number of components of the immunizing antigen, as well as to high molecular weight components of EgE/S and T hydatigena. Destruction of sugar epitopes by periodate treatment significantly decreased the reactivity of this antibody with the somatic antigen, as has been observed before [2, 19] , but had little effect in the case of the E/S preparation. The marked cross-reactivity of the polyclonal antibodies with E/S components of T. hydatigena evidences how difficult it is to obtain a specific assay using these antibodies as reagents. For that reason we concentrated our efforts in the preparation and selection of monoclonal antibodies After initial screening against E/S and Sm and further selection using PAb CGB10 for capture and the hybridoma supernatants for detection, four clones providing the best signal/noise ratios with fecal samples were selected. Among these, clone MAbCPR39, secreting an IgG2b, was chosen."", ""MAb CPR39 copro-ELISA"": ""This ELISA was used to examine fecal samples obtained at the end of the infection, days 27-30 for E. granulosus or at selected dpi (highest cross-reactivity) for T. hydatigena ( figure 2) . The assay performed with negligible reactivity with samples from noninfected dogs and moderate cross-reactivity with T. hydatigena infected animals. All E. granulosus infected dogs were positive, however, the readouts of the samples corresponding to dogs with small parasite burdens were significantly higher, but too close to the mean value of the negative dogs to give unequivocal results. The assay was then used to study the time course of coproantigen excretion during the experimental infection period ( figure 3) . Using a cut-off derived from the analysis of field samples (see below), we found that dogs with high parasite burdens became positive after two weeks, and in spite of some fluctuations remained so thereafter. On the other hand, dogs with less than 200 worms at necropsy, presented low readouts throughout the experiment, becoming positives only at the end of the experimental infection. Along the time course of the examined period, the dogs harboring T. hydatigena worms presented very low values (below the cut-off), showing positive values only in very few days after 40 dpi (not shown)."", ""MAb EG9 copro-ELISA"": ""Due to the limited sensitivity of the CPR39 copro-ELISA, new antibodies were prepared. The best combination resulted when PAb C4 was used as capture antibody in combination with MAb Eg9. The reactivity of PAbC4 with different parasite antigens in western blot was similar to that of PAbCGB10 (figure 1B) and it is not shown. MAbEg9 is an IgG; its reactivity with different parasite extracts is displayed in figure 1C . The antibody reacted with a large number of the EgSm bands, mostly in the middle to high molecular weight range. Two components of 100 and 160 kDa are the most prominent immunoreactive bands of the E/S antigens, which appear to be also present in the Sm preparation. The crossreactivity with Th E/S antigens was negligible (as was also the case with protoscoleces antigens, not shown). Treatment with periodate had no effect upon the reactivity of MAbEg9 with any of the antigens, which was unexpected because previous studies have shown that the sugar epitopes have a major role in the immune response against E. granulosus coproantigens [2, 19] . To rule out technical artifacts, the efficacy of the periodate treatment was tested in parallel using the monoclonal antibody E492/G1 that defines a sugar epitope highly expressed in E. granulosus protoscoleces preparations [20] , figure 1D .When the experimentally-infected dog samples were analyzed with the new assay, it was evident that the Eg9 copro-ELISA produced stronger signals with samples from dogs with small numbers of worms, allowing a better discrimination between noninfected and infected dogs ( figure 4) . This is an important improvement because most of the reported tests failed to detect these kind of samples. Cross-reactivity with T. hydatigena coproanti-gens did not seem to be a major problem when the time course of coproantigen excretion was study with the Eg9 copro-ELISA ( figure 5 ). Using the cut-off estimated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves from the analysis of field samples (see below), only on very few occasions and after 40 dpi were some of the samples from T. hydatigena infected dogs positive. The Eg9 copro-ELISA allowed an earlier detection of infected dogs. Animals with 200 or more parasites became positive between 12-15 dpi and by dpi 20 all infected dogs were positives and remained so thereafter. Curiously, coproantigens in dogs P7 and P8 samples could be detected very early. This is more remarkable in the case of dog P7 that harbored a rather small number of worms (128) at necropsy, and may be the result of the spontaneous expulsion of worms a few days after infection. "", ""Analysis of field samples"": ""The cut-off and cross-reactivity of the assays were evaluated with field samples collected from 96 unwanted dogs in the provinces of Chubut, Argentina and Junin, Peru. Upon necropsy, 9 of 85 dogs from Chubut, and 6 of 11 dogs from Junin were positive for E. granulosus, 48 were infected with other parasites and 33 were found negative, table 1. Fecal samples from these dogs were tested using the CPR39 and Eg9 copro-ELISAs and the cutoff selected from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves [18] to have a convenient balance between sensitivity and specificity as follows: CPR39 ELISA = 0.224 AU and Eg9 ELISA = 0.340 AU. Using these values, the sensitivity of the tests were 80.0 and 86.6% respectively, which is in agreement with the results obtained with the experimental infection of dogs, figure 4 . The specificity of the Eg9 test was also superior 86.4% versus 82.7% for the CPR39 ELISA. In addition, the CPR39 test produced readings close to the cut-off for an important number of samples, figure 6 , which may be problematic for the use of a cutoff internal calibrator, because small inter-assay variations in the reading of the calibrator may have an important effect upon the number of samples that are classified in either category. Actually, if samples that fall between 610% of the cut-off are considered as undetermined (a common practice), none of the samples analyzed with the Eg9 test would fall in this category, while four of the samples analyzed with the CPR39 would. While it was not possible to obtain an exact counting of parasites in the dogs from the province of Chubut, this was feasible in the case of the animals necropsied in Junin. Although most dogs had a large number of worms, two of them did not, and these two dogs were exaustively examined. We found only 9 E. granulosus and 2 Ascaris lumbricoides, and 47 E. granulosus and very few Dipylidium caninum worms in the first and second dogs, respectively. Interestingly, the average absorbance readings of the fecal samples obtained from these animal were 1.16 and 2.99 AU, which represent strong positive results, indicating the sensitivity of the test and confirming the capacity of the assay to detect small numbers of parasites that had been observed in the experimentally infected dogs. In this regard, when the E. granulosus positive dogs from the experimental infection are included, the overall sensitivity of the test rises to 92.6%. Despite the fact that MAbEg9 was selected for its reduced cross-reactivity with the ThSm antigen, most of its cross-reactivity was against dogs infected with T. spp (mostly hydatigena) alone or together with other parasites. Only one dog infected with T. canis (1.44 AU) and one of the non-infected dogs (0.694 AU) from the province of Chubut were classified as positive with the Eg9 ELISA, figure 6 . The relatively high readings of these two samples are unexpected. Based on the results of the experimental infection of dogs and the fact that all other samples (19) from dogs harboring T. canis alone or together with Dipylidium caninum showed very low readings, a misdiagnosis at necropsy can not be discarded. It is worth noting that cross-reactivity was essentially against Taenia. Despite the fact that we could not identify to species all field samples, the great majority of samples from Chubut and all from Junin corresponded to T. hydatigena; hence most false positive results will be related to dogs eating offal. Development of the ELISA test in a kit format and interlaboratory analysis of blind samplesThe Eg9 test was then formulated in a kit format to facilitate its use and transference to other laboratories. Initially, we studied different conditions for coating and drying the plates and found that using sugars as additives during drying have the best effect on the stability of the capture antibody. Trehalose and sucrose showed the best results and the latter was chosen because of its much lower cost. Figure 7A shows that dried plates showed similar capacity as fresh ones to discriminate between weak positive and negative samples over a one year period of storage at 4uC. Similar results were obtained after 2 years of storage (not shown). To set up the value of the cut-off an internal standard was prepared by adjusting the dilution of the E. granulosus Sm antigen in order to produce a readout equal to the value of the cut-off. The stability of this cut-off calibrator solution and other components of the assay (in their ready-to-use dilution) were tested using different diluent buffers at 4uC, room temperature, and 37uC, and some representative results are shown in figure 7B-D. Different formulations of the calibrator solution were stable over a 6 month period, even at 37uC; only the results for the Sm antigen diluted in PBS, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Kathon (Dow Chemicals, Midland, Michigan) are shown. The reactivity of MAb Eg9 started to diminish after a few days at 37uC, but was highly stable over the 6 month period at 4uC (not shown) or at room temperature, figure 7C . The most critical component was the secondary antibody. For several different formulations (only two shown in figure 7D ) all of them rapidly lost the enzymatic activity at 37uC, but using PBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.1% Kathon, 0.1 mM TMB, the conjugate remained stable for up to 150 days at room temperature (or 4uC, not shown). Overall, we can conclude that even at room temperature the kit has a safe shelf life of 3 months, which can surely be extended upon refrigeration, which is a convenient advantage for the shipment and use of the kit in remote places. Due to the availability of commercial ready-to-use TMB substrate solutions, the preparation of this kit component was not pursued in this study. In case of high demand of the kit, it will be necessary to prepare new PAb. In our experience, this is a critical component of the test, but we have selected similarly performing PAbs from a panel of 3 to 4 immunized rabbits, after initial selection with fecal samples from dogs harboring low number of E. granulosus parasites and counter selection with samples from T. hydatigena infected dogs.The reproducibility of the results obtained with the copro-ELISA kit and the feasibility of its transference were demonstrated by the analysis of blind samples. To this end, 52 fecal samples collected in the province of Junin, Peru were processed as described, and aliquots were distributed to two laboratories (INS and DIGESA) in Lima, Peru, where the copro-ELISA kit had been transferred, and to our laboratory in Uruguay (Facultad de Qu\u00edmica). The samples were independently analyzed by the three laboratories and classified as positive, negative or uncertain if their readout felt within the calibrator absorbance reading 610% range. Twenty four samples were positive, indicating a prevalence of 46.1% in the studied areas (Canchayllo and Jauja). The kit performed with excellent reproducibility and all individual samples were equally classified by the three laboratories with the exception of two of the samples with readings close to the cut-off, one of them categorized as negative by two of the labs and uncertain by the third one, and another sample classified as (weak) positive by two of the labs and uncertain by the remaining one."", ""Concluding Remarks"": ""Two tests were developed and the difference in their performance highlights the importance that careful selection of antibody pairs has to attain a high standard of sensitivity and specificity. The Eg9 test performed with high sensitivity (92.6%) and good specificity (86.4%). These parameters are closely similar to previously reported values for other tests. However, it is very important to keep in mind that the only trustworthy comparison of tests is that obtained with a common panel of samples assayed under identical conditions, which highlights the need of interlaboratory studies to compare the performance of existing test.The test cross-reactivity was low, and in addition, since it was basically restricted to T. hydatigena, most false positive results will still indicate access of dogs to offal. A major contribution of our study is the use of a well-characterized MAb that assures availability and batch-to-batch reproducibility, as well as the formulation of the assay in a kit format with extended shelf life. The Eg9 test is being shared with other control programs in the region and we hope that it will help to monitor the progress of control programs and standardize the epidemiological baseline information in the region."", ""Supporting Information"": ""Checklist S1 STARD Checklist for the Eg9 copro antigen test."", ""(DOC)"": ""Flowchart S1 STARD flow chart detailing the method used to assess the diagnostic performance of the Eg9 copro antigen test.(DOCX)""}",A Monoclonal Antibody-Based Copro-ELISA Kit for Canine Echinococcosis to Support the PAHO Effort for Hydatid Disease Control in South America,"Cystic echinococcosis is still a major concern in South America. While some regions show advances in the control of the disease, others have among the highest incidence in the world. To reverse this situation the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has launched a regional project on cystic echinococcosis control and surveillance. An early concern of the program was the lack of a standardized diagnostic tool to monitor infection in dogs, a key target of control programs. Under this premise, we have developed a new copro-ELISA test after extensive screening of a large panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and polyclonal sera, which performs with high standards of sensitivity (92.6%) and specificity (86.4%) as established by necropsy diagnosis of dogs. The key component of the test, MAbEg9 has a convenient IgG isotype and reacts with a periodate-resistant epitope found in high molecular weight components of the worm. Time-course analysis of experimentally infected dogs showed that even animals with a very low number of parasites could be detected as early as day 20 post infection. The test was formulated in a ready-to-use kit format with proven stability of each component for a minimum of 3 months at room temperature. This characteristic facilitates its standardized use and shipping to other laboratories, which was demonstrated by the identical results obtained by two different laboratories in Peru and our own laboratory when a large number of field samples were analyzed independently in a blind fashion.",10.1371/journal.pntd.0001967,Medline; PMC,PMC3542170,23326610.0,cc-by,2013-01-10,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,,,15791251.0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23326610/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0001967,2013.0,paper

With more than 18.0 million new cases every year globally, about 50,000 new patients are diagnosed and require treatment every day [1] . Progress has been substantial over the last 40 years and the decline in mortality has been linked to prevention, early diagnosis, and the quality of treatment [2] .The unprecedented worldwide occurrence of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic [3] is not like any other seasonal infection and is having a profound effect on the entire oncology community [4] by impacting patients with cancer and reducing healthcare activities for a duration that cannot yet be accurately estimated [5] . Moreover, the high contagiousness of the virus appears to be associated with a risk of contamination of caregivers, which may seriously limit healthcare capacities [6] . Although the management of patients with serious infections (viral, bacterial, and fungal) is well known to oncologists and hematologists and has always been part of cancer management, occurrence of COVID-19 in patients with cancer has been reported to be associated with an increased mortality [7] . Furthermore, available data on patients with cancer are currently primarily derived from limited experience in China, with very limited information in Western populations [8] . As the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading across the world, several initiatives for data collection, recommendations, and guidance have been made available to help physicians and patients with cancer to protect themselves from the COVID-19 infection (Table 1) .While one may wonder if it is wise to look at cancer consequences during the peak incidence of COVID-19 infection, it should be emphasized that mid-term consequences on cancer shall remain a priority to avoid excesses morbidity and mortality during and after the end of the pandemic. In this paper, we aimed to look at various aspects and consequences of the COVID-19 infection for cancer caregivers and patients from a global standpoint, taking advantage of information generated in Asia."", ""Diagnosis of COVID-19 Infection in Patients with Cancer"": ""The COVID-19 crisis started in China in December 2019 with a cluster of pneumonia cases from an unknown pathogen identified first in Wuhan [9] . There are no specific clinical features that can yet reliably distinguish COVID-19 from other viral respiratory infections. Thus far, there is no specific symptom of COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer. The most prevalent clinical signs of infection [9] are fever (99%), fatigue (70%), dry cough (59%), anorexia (40%), myalgias (35%), dyspnea (31%), and sputum production (27%), with anosmia and ageusia also being reported in many patients [10] . Laboratory features are leukopenia, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, elevated inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and ferritin, elevated d-dimer, elevated creatine phosphokinase, and elevated creatinine levels [5, 7] . Consistent with viral pneumonia, chest CT scan in patients with COVID-19 most commonly demonstrates bilateral ground-glass opacifications preferentially distributed in the periphery of lower lobes [11] . Importantly, those signs are also routinely reported in patients with cancer due to the cancer, cancer therapy, or common cancer infections, generating some confusion in ascertaining the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer. However, particular attention is given to the occurrence of any of those signs during the period of the pandemic to minimize the risk of underdiagnosing COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer during the entire duration of the outbreak. This is particularly important (but not restricted to) in patients with lung cancer, who also frequently present with tobacco exposure and chronic underlying pulmonary disorders that are additional factors of vulnerability. From Chinese data, patients who underwent both reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and chest CT scan for evaluation of COVID-19, a \""positive\"" chest CT for COVID-19 (as determined by a consensus of two radiologists) had a sensitivity of 97%, using the PCR tests as a reference; however, specificity was only 25%. In cases where there is suspicion of COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer, PCR testing and chest CT scan evaluation are highly recommended to consolidate the diagnosis [12] ."", ""Lessons Learned from Cancer Data Generated in Asia"": ""Particular attention was immediately given to patients with cancer in the Chinese nationwide cohort, recognizing that patients with cancer, representing about 1% of the COVID-19-infected population, were particularly vulnerable, with a case fatality rate of 5.6% compared to 2.3% in the general population. More recently, the retrospective experience from Wuhan hospitals identified a total of 28 PCR-confirmed patients with cancer who were admitted for in-patient care [13] . The population of patients with cancer comprised 60.7% males with a medium age of 65 years, with lung cancer being the most frequent tumor type (25%). Anticancer therapies provided within 14 days prior to admission were chemotherapy (10.7%), targeted therapy (7.1%), radiotherapy (3.6%), and immunotherapy (3.6%). Patients with cancer in this cohort also have concomitant morbidities associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 morbidity such as diabetes (14.3%), chronic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (14.3%), chronic liver diseases (7.1%), and pulmonary diseases (3.6%). Contamination of patients with cancer was suspected to have occurred during hospitalization in 28.6% of patients. COVID-19-related symptoms were similar in patients with cancer to those reported in the overall population, including ground-glass opacity on CT scan. Oxygen therapy was required in 78.6% of this cancer population and 7.1% of patients required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Patients with lung cancer and worse baseline lung function or endurance were more likely to develop severe hypoxia. Severe events occurred more frequently in stage 4 patients (70%) compared to other stages (44.4%) and in patients exposed to anticancer therapies within 14 days prior to COVID-19 infection (83%). Severe secondary complications occurring during COVID-19 infections were acute respiratory distress syndrome (28.6%), septic shock (3.6%), myocardial infarction (3.6%), and pulmonary embolism (7.1%). Importantly, deaths occurred in eight (28.6%) patients, with a median time from admission to death of 16 days. Although statistical analyses remain limited by the number of patients, multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional analysis adjusted by age and gender showed that antitumor treatment and patchy consolidation on CT scan at admission were associated with a higher risk of severe events. Although retrospective and based on a relatively small number of patients, Chinese data are important in starting to set out appropriate measures for prevention of COVID-19 infection during hospitalization (substantial cause of contamination) and the treatment of COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer. However, it seems difficult to draw definitive conclusions related to data generated from the Chinese nationwide cohort where the majority of patients identified with COVID-19 infection were survivors who had no prior cancer therapy within a month prior to COVID-19 infection. Multivariate assessment of the impact of cancer staging and cancer-associated co-morbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases were not found to be significantly associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection but may have been underestimated because of the limited number of patients. Moreover, the cohort is restricted to PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, which considering the false-negative rate of this testing may underestimate the overall COVID-19 diagnosis in patients with cancer, such as when patients are only diagnosed as being COVID-positive based on specific CT-scan images. Finally, this report appears to be restricted to the worst cases, requiring in-hospital admission, and providing no evidence of COVID-19 incidence, morbidity, and mortality in patients with cancer who had recommendations to stay at home and were not referred to a hospital. Nevertheless, this publication highlights the specific vulnerability of patients with cancer to COVID-19 infection and identifies recent prior therapy and patchy consolidation on CT scan at admission as major factors predicting the severity of infection."", ""Protection of COVID-Negative Individuals in Cancer Wards During the Pandemic"": ""Protecting both patients and caregivers in cancer wards is a high priority, needing to be reinforced by all possible means, and is essential for the continuity of cancer care [14] . Most hospitals are avoiding moving patients into the hospital when it is not strictly necessary, developing teleconsultations and shortening stays in outpatient clinics [15] . Several recommendations have been provided to prevent droplet and hand contamination, requiring patients and healthcare professionals to wear protective masks, use hydroalcoholic solutions, and/or wash hands before and after patient-to-professional contacts, reinforce disinfection of surfaces, avoid waiting rooms, and maintain at least a 1-m distance when circulating in the oncology ward [16] . Avoiding mixing COVID-19-positive or -suspected patients with COVID-19-free patients has become a mandatory requirement in oncology and hematology to keep oncology wards COVID-19 free [17] . Conversely, patients suspected of or confirmed as having COVID infection must be hospitalized in specifically separated COVID-19 units. This has encouraged cancer and hematology departments to consider systematically testing patients with a new cancer diagnosis or in need of cancer treatment for COVID-19 contamination, even in asymptomatic patients [18] . This is particularly applicable for patients with acute leukemia, aggressive lymphoma, or myelodysplasia, where the clinical presentation and/ or treatment with high-dose therapy with or without stem cell transplantation is associated with neutropenia, leading to an increased risk of febrile complications, due in most cases to bacterial or fungal infections. In this context, viral infection may be complicated with more frequent bacterial and fungal co-infections, with an increased likelihood of fatal outcome. Furthermore, surgery may be considered as an additional risk factor, especially in patients with comorbidities requiring post-surgery intensive care resuscitation and long-term hospitalization. In many cases such as with breast cancer, the delays have been associated with higher breast cancer-specific mortality. As a result, tumor resection for early operable stages is recommended, but whenever possible diagnostic or staging surgery should be replaced by radiologic diagnostics. Adapting surgical techniques to reduce the risks of exposure of caregivers in the surgical theater is recommended. For instance, with open surgery, surgeons should attempt to avoid exposure to aerosolized viral particles and reduce operative times.Avoiding COVID-19 infection in cancer survivors is wise considering the risk of a detrimental outcome in cases of COVID-19 infection [19] . Home containment must be strictly maintained in cancer survivors, avoiding unnecessary in-hospital visits, imaging, and consultations. Remote follow-up using teleconsultations for cancer survivors are to be preferred for maintaining regular contacts with patients, postponing non-essential follow-up imaging whenever possible. Advantage should be taken of call or videoconference contacts with patients to reinforce information on protective measures against COVID-19 infection and to provide psychological support.In most cases, scheduled and ongoing cancer therapy should be maintained or adapted according to recommendations provided by the scientific society or governmental health offices to ensure the quality of care."", ""Testing Patients with Cancer for COVID-19 Infection"": ""Diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer remains challenging. Currently used PCR methods for COVID-19 infection, albeit not widely available in all states and countries, allow detection of infected patients with high specificity when positive but are also acknowledged to have a relatively high level of false negatives [12] . Many patients with cancer may harbor negative viral PCR expression but may still be infected and contagious. Conversely, clinical signs of COVID-19 infection are non-specific, especially in patients with cancer where occurrence of infection is highly prevalent.Testing patients before surgical procedures may have been adopted by many centers but remains a matter of controversy in many others as the sensitivity of PCR testing (as well as most rapid immunological testing) is associated with a high number of false-negative results. Some centers are also doing a second round of PCR testing to improve sensitivity. However, until more accurate diagnostic tests are available, negative PCR testing results do not fully guaranty the absence of occult infection and may still lead to surgical procedures be carried out in infected patients. As a result, clinical symptoms, radiological CT-scan images, and any other signs suggesting COVID-19 infection may be regarded as non-specific but sufficient to take preventive actions and initiate specific follow-up for patients with cancer. In many units the development of daily teleconsultations is allowing the establishment of a COVID-19-supected patient with cancer registry, quantifying the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in survivors and outpatient clinics [20] .From our own experience, several patients followed daily by phone or through teleconsultations have been identified with clinical signs of COVID-19 infection (pulmonary infection with no other COVID-19 etiology, specific CT-scan, and/or PCR positivity) that has been fully reversible, suggesting that the prevalence of non-severe infection may be higher than that expected from retrospective registries developed in hospitals from patients admitted for severe infection. Careful follow-up of COVID-19-suspected patients with cancer is also providing advantages in cases of worsening of clinical signs to facilitate admissions in emergency and intensive care units. Finally, one advantage of developing a specific registry and broad testing of patients with cancer is to obtain information on the prevalence of the disease in the patient population and facilitate inclusion of patients in COVID-19-specific clinical trials."", ""Challenges for COVID-19-Positive Patients with Cancer"": ""At present, there are few data, but these suggest that only 1% of patients with cancer have been hospitalized (Chinese data), provided that all patients have been identified in the databases [5] . Infection with COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of seriousness, possibly linked to cancer and the other co-morbidities frequently associated with cancer (pre-existing pulmonary pathology, tobacco use, cardiovascular pathology, obesity, immunosuppression, etc.) [21] . When cancer is cured or in remission (long-term survivors), cancer may appear as just one severity factor among others, and management will not differ from that of other patients in the management of COVID-19 infection. Concomitant-to-cancer co-morbidities are often but not always associated with the diagnosis of cancer. From currently available data, lung cancer and other tobaccorelated lung and cardiovascular diseases have been frequently observed as detrimental factors associated with severe complications of COVID-19 infection. Conversely, no data are available suggesting that patients with few or no co-morbidities such as patients with breast and colon cancer may share a similarly poor outcome when infected with COVID-19. More data are therefore required to define conditions leading to severe complications of COVID-19 infection in cancer patient subpopulations.In COVID-19-infected patients with cancer scheduled for surgery or treated with radiotherapy and/or medical oncology therapy, including high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation, allograft, or CAR T-cell infusion, common sense would strongly suggest postponing therapy until the complete disappearance of any clinical and radiological signs and negativity of COVID-19 PCR. In the event of needing intensive care resuscitation and mechanical ventilation, oncologists should quickly liaise with the resuscitators to discuss which prognostic factors of cancer (and other co-morbidities) may affect the decision to intubate. Interdisciplinary boards, including palliative-care teams and ethics committees, have been incorporated in several anticancer centers, and it is recommended to pre-emptively discuss with them the most acute severe cases requiring intensive care.Following recovery from COVID-19 infection, therapeutic management of cancer should resume as soon as possible to limit the risk of cancer-related death. Not all medical oncology therapies-including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy-are associated with immunosuppression. Different anticancer therapies may not lead to the same risk and more data are needed to identify which anticancer therapies are more frequently associated with risk for cancer patients. However, so far there are no data suggesting that therapy with minimal immunosuppression may be associated with better outcome, and therefore it may be wise to carefully consider all medical oncology therapy as providing an equally detrimental risk in case of COVID-19 infection. Most COVID-19 infections seem to be controlled within 2 weeks, although some patients may remain PCR positive for 4 weeks, suggesting that postponing anticancer therapy for at least 2-4 weeks may be required."", ""Antiviral Therapies in Patients with Cancer"": ""Several antiviral therapies against COVID-19 infection have been used compassionately (retrospectively analyzed) or as part of prospective uncontrolled and controlled clinical trials (most trials are ongoing). In the emergency of the healthcare crisis, first uncontrolled data generated expectations but were also subjected to a high degree of controversy. In data published thus far, there are no subgroup analyses for patients with cancer. However, publications of upcoming clinical trials should be scrutinized for subgroup analyses of patients with cancer. Moreover, several clinical trials specifically designed for patients with cancer are ongoing, which may help in our understanding of how patients with cancer should be treated for COVID-19 infection. The use of antiviral therapy outside clinical trials in COVID-19-infected patients remains controversial. Thus far, limited data are available in patients with cancer. In the report from the Wuhan cohort of patients during the Chinese COVID-19 outbreak [13] , antiviral agents were used empirically in 20 (71.4%) patients, including arborol in 14 (50%) patients, lopinavir/ritonavir in ten (35.7%) patients, ganciclovir in nine (32.1%) patients, and ribavirin in one (3.6%) patient; nine (32.1%) patients received combinations of several antiviral agents. Systemic corticosteroids were given to 15 (53.6%) patients, mainly in severe cases (12 patients). Moreover, intravenous immunoglobin was prescribed to 12 (35.7%) patients. These data did not report benefits in outcome or conversion from mild to severe cases in this patient population. No safety concerns were reported. However, this patient population remains limited. Including patients with cancer in antiviral treatment registries and clinical trials investigating COVID-19 antiviral therapies is highly advisable. Although very limited information is available, the use of anticancer agents concomitantly with antiviral therapy outside clinical trials is not recommended to avoid unpredicted pharmacokinetic interactions and toxicity, as previously described with antiviral agents for hepatitis B [22] ."", ""Organization of Cancer Care During"": ""the Outbreak (Fig. 1) Contradictory injunctions frequently occur when trying to maintain continuity and quality of care to limit cancer mortality, while contingencies in healthcare capacity are restricting non-COVID-19 activities in most hospitals and cancer wards [23] . For many cancers, earlier stages of cancer and lack of delay in diagnosis and therapy are associated with significant benefits in terms of morbidity and mortality. Postponed diagnoses and treatment delays are usually regarded as detrimental factors for patients with cancer [24] . However, it is becoming more difficult to convince of the importance of maintaining functional cancer wards in healthcare institutions currently focused in short-term emergency care following nationwide mobilizations in response to COVID-19 infection. In many places, difficulties are currently observed in mobilizing diagnosis, surgery, radiation oncology, medical oncology, hematology units, and their professionals, some of whom are off duty due to caregiver infections. Oncology societies have rapidly provided specific recommendations for various tumor types in trying to maintain essential actions for cancer care according to staging and prognosis, suggesting postponing non-essential imaging in cancer survivors, and attempting to limit the frequency of medical therapy in currently treated patients to avoid contamination during in-hospital visits. For instance, it has been proposed that some cancer surgeries are delayed toxicity during trials and/or because monitoring and assurance quality for safety could not be continued due to limited human resources including Clinical Research Associates or postponed using neoadjuvant therapies. Carrying out radiotherapy may become complex [25] . More specifically, COVID-19 protection during transportation of patients for daily treatment, protection of professional (manipulators, physicists, radiotherapists, etc.), and disinfection of radiotherapy equipment during therapies have been regarded as potential factors limiting treatment availability in several centers [26] . Moreover, difficulty in carrying out chemotherapy and other medical treatments for cancer (availability and protection of teams, risks of aplasia, estimation of risk benefit, etc.) is making it difficult to maintain quality of care in medical oncology. Although medical society recommendations may be relatively easy to implement in comprehensive cancer centers, they may be more difficult to implement in university and community hospitals and clinics. Furthermore, low evidence-based medicine specifically developed during COVID-19 outbreak may be subject to individual legal actions from patients and families if it can be demonstrated that casualty was related to a lack of optimal patient care at the completion of the COVID-19 outbreak.While most cancer hospital administrations are convinced that cancer wards will be preserved and remain functional during the COVID-19 outbreak, it remains important to emphasize for others the importance of patient protection from COVID-19 infection, keeping cancer wards COVID-19 free (taking care of COVID-19-diagnosed patients outside the cancer wards) and allocating sufficient resources to maintain the quality of care for patients with cancer during the outbreak."", ""Protection of Professionals"": ""One of the specific features of COVID-19 infection is its contagiousness, which can directly impact professionals who are in contact with patients [27] . Despite no clinical symptoms and a negative COVID-19 PCR, patients may carry on viral replication and may transmit infection to professionals. Education and preventive barriers (facial masks, hydroalcoholic hand wash solutions, disposable overalls, etc.) are mandatory for all professionals who are in contact with patients with cancer. There has been no obvious specificity related to patients with cancer as compared to others, but considering the high degree of specialization required from professionals for cancer care, it is highly advisable to take protective measures to ensure the safety of caregivers and to maintain an efficient staff. The anxiety induced by the risk of personal contamination is often an added stress factor associated with the care of patients suffering from cancer and exposed to cancer treatment-related side effects. Particular attention to the psychological tension associated with cancer care during the COVID-19 outbreak is recommended for professionals dealing with cancer treatment [28] ."", ""Impact on Vulnerable Populations"": ""The COVID-19 outbreak has exposed weaknesses in healthcare systems [23] . Many countries are facing the consequences of shortages of personal protective equipment, tests, ventilators, and professionals regardless of the type of healthcare systems. Public health officials are bracing for surges in the number of patients, urging people with symptoms to stay home and call their doctor before seeking in-person medical care. Unfortunately, for many low-income individuals, poorly educated populations, jailed prisoners, and undocumented immigrants, access to primary medical care remains challenging [29] . Social distancing aiming at mitigating the spread of severe cases among the entire population that was hailed as a solution to reducing casualty, is or will be associated with reduced incomes and losses of employment. It is likely that social consequences may facilitate the maintenance of COVID-19 infection and contamination. As those individuals are also recognized as highly vulnerable populations for cancer-related mortality, COVID-19 may be regarded as an additional detrimental factor for highly vulnerable patients with cancer."", ""Direct Impact on Cancer Mortality"": ""Cancer is still the second leading cause of death globally, and it may be further impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, with a worldwide mortality rate that may be ranging up to 5.6% in China and up to 15.2% outside China for newly diagnosed people [30] . Indeed, mortality seems to vary from one country to another. However, COVID-19 infection is likely to increase cancer-related mortality, as case fatality rates are much higher for vulnerable populations, such as the elderly (over 80 years of age, > 14%) and those with co-existing conditions (10% for those with cardiovascular disease, 7% for those with diabetes, and around 6% for those with chronic respiratory diseases, high blood pressure, and cancer) [5] . Although data remain sparse and derive essentially from China, patients with cancer, who also often present with several of the aforementioned co-morbidities, appear therefore as being highly vulnerable, and potential subjects for high mortality rates.Indirect impact may also be anticipated. As healthcare providers are reorganized to provide high priority to the COVID-19 pandemic, shortages of hospital beds and availability of the healthcare workforces are being observed, asking professionals in charge of chronic diseases including cancer to postpone diagnosis and treatment. As a result, the COVID-19 outbreak is currently having a profound impact on cancer care. Most actions aiming at prevention, screening, and early diagnosis of cancer are currently on hold or are severely restricted. In most cancer wards, initiatives have been immediately placed to protect patients with active or a prior history of cancer. However, in routine practice, restricting in-hospital visits aiming at avoiding contagious contacts for patients with cancer often results in postponing primary diagnosis and delaying complex hightech therapies such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy/immunotherapy [31] . How much normalization of cancer diagnostics and therapy will be possible after the COVID-19 outbreak remains unknown, but will be highly dependent on the ability of healthcare systems to resume standard activities without being flooded with delayed cancer care. Moreover, the duration of the outbreak (which is still unknown) is likely to last for at least 3 months, a duration that may be associated with cancer progression that could impact the prognosis of several patients. Furthermore, medical societies have also implemented low-evidence-based but convenient recommendations during COVID-19 outbreak to balance standard-ofcare requirements and healthcare accessibility. As early diagnosis and quality of evidence-based cancer therapy have been the driving forces behind reducing cancer mortality for the last 50 years, the current COVID-19 outbreak is likely to have an indirect mid-term impact on cancer-related mortality. We believe that awareness of oncologists and their sustained involvement within multidisciplinary teams could help to limit the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on cancer mortality."", ""Remote Consequences of the COVID-19 Crisis on Cancer Diagnosis and Mortality"": ""As a consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak, most countries have decided to take aggressive measures of prevention that are currently strongly impacting the global economy.Economists are foreseeing a global post-COVID-19 outbreak economic downturn and recession [32] . The modeling of a year-long lockdown shows that the economy would shrink by approximately 22% at a cost of $4.2 trillion. Without containment measures, the economy would be contracted by about 7% within a year but as many as 500,000 additional lives would be lost; this would translate into a loss of about $6.1 trillion [33] .While it is currently difficult to anticipate the medical consequences of the post-COVID-19 economic crisis, data deriving from the subprime mortgage crisis may help in identifying factors with an impact on diagnosis and mid-term cancer mortality. For instance, data from the California Cancer Registry data showed that the cancer incidence rate declined yearly by 3.3% in males and 1.4% in females during the USA recession/recovery period [34] . This decrease in cancer incidence affected particularly male patients with prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers and female patients with breast cancer, melanoma, and ovarian cancer. The decreased incidence was associated with unemployment and may have occurred as a result of decreased engagement in prevention and early diagnosis, particularly for malignancies that may have been considered clinically less urgent cancers. On a global perspective, data from the World Bank and WHO generated from more than 2 billion people from 1990 to 2010 showed that rises in unemployment were significantly associated with an increase in all-cancer mortality and all specific cancers except lung cancer in women [35] . These data have highlighted that the 2008-2010 economic crisis was associated with about 260,000 excess cancer-related deaths in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Universal health coverage and publicsector expenditure on healthcare were shown to protect against this excess in cancer mortality rate. Altogether, an increased mortality rate is expected in patients with cancer as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 infection and a remote aftermath effect on the outbreak on the global economy. High-performing health systems are expected to be sufficiently resilient to the consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic and may hopefully be more able to counteract the remote impact on cancer mortality."", ""Psychological Support for Patients with Cancer and Their Relatives"": ""The COVID-19 outbreak is generating important traumatic psychological consequences in the general population due to the constant exposure to stressful headline news, unemployment, home restriction, and social distancing [36] . Patients with cancer and healthcare providers are exposed to similar stresses, with the addition of facing the diagnosis and treatment of a dreadful disease. Relatives who usually accompany patients for diagnosis, treatment, and palliative care are discouraged from visiting patients in hospitals. As a result, frontline healthcare workers have become the main people to provide psychological interventions to patients in hospitals. Professionals who are devoted to their patients are facing the risk of contamination at work for themselves and their relatives. In oncology wards, reinforcement should be made in terms of identifying professional teams that comprise mental health personnel as a basic tenet in dealing with emotional distress for patients with cancer and healthcare providers. Furthermore, careful follow-up of lonely patients with cancer confined at home can be proposed, using telephone or video consultation, taking advantage of the availability of many home-confined mental health professionals [37] ."", ""Cancer Research During and After the COVID-19 Outbreak"": ""The mobilization of teams for internal reorganization to continue oncology care and/or participate in COVID-19 activities, along with transient eviction of COVID-19-positive caregivers, may result in an effective shortage of human resources to screen or include new patients in clinical trials exploring anticancer agents during the COVID outbreak [38] . Consistently, the majority of pharmaceutical or academic sponsors have provided official guidance to investigative sites to hold whenever possible new screenings and inclusions until the resolution of the COVID-19 outbreak, with the exception of urgent cases (such as particular life-threatening situations in hematology). Instead, hematology and oncology research teams have to focus on maintaining the safety of patients already included in ongoing trials via reinforced monitoring and optimized communication with the sponsor. Detecting and scrutinizing the onset of COVID-19 infection symptoms in patients treated with innovative anticancer therapeutics is mandatory for optimal reporting to the sponsor and for early management of research patients. Remote instead of on-site monitoring may be proposed to maintain realtime close collaboration between investigators and sponsor representatives. This can ensure the quality and contemporaneous assessment of data, and partially limit the accumulation of monitoring duties during the post-COVID-19 aftermath period. On the other hand, patients with cancer treated outside prospective oncology trials and developing COVID-19 infection may participate in clinical research projects under development against COVID-19 infection if they comply with inclusion criteria, their history of cancer being one among other possible concomitant morbidities, and given the fact that anticancer therapy is likely to be halted until they recover from COVID-19 infection.Finally, given the limited data from the epidemic in China, a COVID-19 cancer registry seems essential to adapt our practices based on wider evidence of data, especially in Western populations. The French hematology and oncology community among others are launching a descriptive analysis of patients with cancer hospitalized for COVID-19 infection to characterize prospectively their outcome and identify prognosis factors [39] ."", ""Post-Outbreak Normalization of Cancer-Related Activities"": ""Data from China and Korea [40] as well as modeling data from the UK [41] strongly suggest that home containment aimed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on intensive care requirements and casualties may prolong the duration of the epidemic. Infestations from non-symptomatic reservoirs occurring after the initial epidemic peak may result in the maintenance of COVID-19 infection with remnant waves of COVID-19 cases occurring as a result of transient releases of home containment. Altogether, it is likely that protection of patients and healthcare providers may be required for several weeks or months until at least 80% of the population develop post-infection immunity or (still non-available) vaccination (Fig. 2) . Whenever available, serological COVID-19 diagnosis may facilitate the identification of immune patients and healthcare workers who are no longer at risk for COVID-19 infection. Until this time, all protection procedures, including COVID-19-free oncology wards, will have to be maintained. Most of the healthcare systems will have to promptly reorganize themselves to prioritize the rescheduling of patients who have been postponed for diagnosis and treatments during the wave of COVID-19 infection. Patients underdiagnosed during the COVID-19 home containment may also appear with urgent needs for diagnosis and care at the end of the wave of infection. Further, many patients and primary-care physicians distracted by the COVID-19 infection for whom guidelines were to avoid contact with hospital facilities during the COVID-19 outbreak, may be reluctant and afraid to resume usual contacts with hospital Fig. 2 The COVID-19 outbreak multistep crisis. Each country (one after another) foresees multiple-step crises. New COVID-19 infections may occur during all stages wards. Moreover, fatigue as well as the impact of income from the economic recession for healthcare providers is a parameter that is yet difficult to estimate, but may be a limiting factor to containing the anticipated increased post-COVID-19 activity.As the COVID-19 infection may remain prevalent for several weeks with strong psychological and economic impact on the entire society, resuming normal cancer care activities will be challenging. In particular, access to high technicalcare facilities such as imaging, surgery facilities, and radiotherapy, which are frequently close to optimal availability in normal conditions, may be flooded with COVID-19-delayed appointments in many hospitals and clinics.At this stage, no global recommendations can be made, but awareness by oncologists could help to limit the impact of COVID-19 post-outbreak crisis."", ""Conclusions"": ""The COVID-19 outbreak is yielding unprecedented consequences on cancer care that may have direct and remote consequences on patients and caregivers.

There were over 8,061,550 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide and 84,867 cases in China as of 18 th June 2020 1, 2 . Among the latter, 19% were severe or critically ill patients who required some form of respiratory support due to hypoxaemia or respiratory failure 3 . The respiratory support included low-flow or high-flow oxygen therapy via nasal cannula or mask; noninvasive or invasive positive pressure ventilation; or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) . Considering the potential of the COVID-19 pandemic to overwhelm healthcare systems, even in developed countries, there is a need to identify subgroups requiring different respiratory support techniques, as well as those requiring prolonged hospital admission, to inform service provision, allocate scarce medical resources appropriately and maximize treatment benefits. Previous studies have reported that older age and male sex were risk factors for poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients, with limited information about the need for respiratory support 4, 5 . A recent study found high levels of respiratory complications in COVID-19 patients requiring surgery, with an associated high mortality 6 .We retrospectively reviewed demographic and clinical data available from electronic medical records at a branch of Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China), a 1,050 bed hospital designated for severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients. This was approved and April 20, 2020 were consecutively included. Median age was 62 yr (interquartile range, 51-70; range, 0-95 yr) and 48.4% were female (Table 1) . Of the 1,792 patients, 72 (4.0%) were admitted from the emergency department and 1,720 (96.0%) were transferred from other hospitals. On admission, most cases were classified as severe (79.9%; i.e. respiratory rate \u2265 30 min -1 , blood oxygen saturation at rest \u2264 93%, PaO 2 /FiO 2 \u2264 300 mm Hg, or increased lung infiltration >50% within 48 h) or critical (14.0%; i.e. shock, respiratory failure or other organ or failure). Only 109 (6.1%) of cases were moderate (i.e. having symptoms and radiological findings of pneumonia, with no requirement for respiratory support). The percentage of patients who were categorised as critical on admission was higher in males and older patients.Among all patients, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation and invasive positive pressure ventilation were given to 60 (3.3%), 135 (7.5%), 104 (5.8%) patients, respectively, with increased requirement for this amongst male and older patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was given to 10 (0.6%) patients and 8 (80.0%) of them were male.The overall case-fatality rate (CFR) was 12.7% (228 deaths among 1,792 confirmed cases) and the median length of hospital stay among deceased patients was 11 (interquartile range, 6-20) days. CFR was elevated among male and older patients.Among surviving patients, 22 (1.2%) were transferred to other hospitals to treat comorbidities after recovery from pneumonia and 1,542 (86.0%) were discharged to isolation centres for 14 days of quarantine. The length of stay among patients discharged was age dependent increasing from 22 (interquartile range, 14-31.3) days in those < 40 yr old to 34 (interquartile range, 24-43.8) days in those aged 80 or over. Of the 1,542 patients who were discharged, 514 (33.3%) required low-flow oxygen therapy at discharge, and the requirement increased with age.A strength of the current study is the size of the cohort of COVID-19 patients requiring respiratory support. These data, from a single centre in Wuhan, provide insights into sex-specific and age-related factors. Our findings could be a useful supplement to previous studies of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 3, 8, 9 , to help inform allocation of scarce healthcare resources (especially respiratory support) and mitigation of adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in other countries. A third of patients with COVID-19 had abnormal pulmonary function at time of hospital discharge with a higher percentage in older patients. Our results are consistent with the findings of a previous study in which 84.2% of severe cases with COVID-19 were discharged with impairment of diffusion capacity 10 . Future studies to address persistent impairment of pulmonary function after COVID-19 and the impact of age are warranted.A limitation with our study is that adherence to the national COVID-19 guidelines might have varied between patients, and therefore we are unable to assess the standard of management applied. While our impression is that adherence was rigorous, we plan to assess this as part of the future research with this cohort. Another limitation is that extraction of other relevant patient level data was restricted, such that more extensive analyses were not possible within the timescale and resources available. This highlights the challenges in rapidly developing a high-quality evidence base in the midst of a global pandemic. Limitations of existing healthcare data systems (e.g. paper medical records, no facility to efficiently extract data from individual records, etc.), lack of appropriately trained personnel as staff are diverted to dealing with acute crisis, and the impact of lockdown on collaborative working are all barriers that need to be considered.Despite these issues, we believe that it is important to report these data as an ""}","Impact of sex and age on respiratory support and length of hospital stay among 1,792 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China",,10.1016/j.bja.2020.07.001,PMC,PMC7365067,,no-cc,2020-07-16,Br J Anaesth,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7365067/,2020.0,paper

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is spread mainly through respiratory droplets and following contact with contaminated surfaces, but limited knowledge of transmission dynamics make effective control of the disease tailored to specific communities challenging. In the absence of an effective vaccine or treatment, nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing measures, which require one to maintain a 6-foot physical distance from non-household members, are the only means of reducing the spread of COVID-19. Examples include closures of schools, ceasing recreational activities, cancellation of large public gatherings, and shelter-in-place policies. When these measures are implemented and followed, daily counts of new COVID-19 cases decrease (\""flattening the curve\""). 1 The negative economic and societal consequences of social distancing warrant a \""dialing back\"" of such policies when it is safe to do so. However, the effect of easing social distancing on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. A set of indicators have been proposed by the current administration to guide communities on when they might consider easing rigorous mandated social distancing. 2 However, these lagging indicators, such as hospitals having the capacity to \""treat patients without crisis care\"", are not ideal because once the number of new infections increases, re-implementation of social distancing is not as effective as a mitigation option due to exponential growth in the case of transmissible infectious diseases such as COVID-19. 2 The ability to predict the effect of easing of social distancing is important to provide leading indicators for the right time to do this for a particular community.Using the best information available, mathematical modeling of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics allow scientists to forecast the effect of social distancing on the COVID-.

In particular, agent-based models provide a flexible and simulation-based method to better represent transmission dynamics in a complex system. While other models are available, including those providing predictions for every state in the U.S., these models have several limitations that severely limit their generalizability. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] For example, they assume a closed population and ignore imported infections into the region, do not consider imperfect adherence levels to the dynamic social distancing measures accurately, and most do not incorporate the effect of limited testing capacity into the number of confirmed cases. [3] [4] [5] [6] We present an agent-based model that represents the social network and interactions among the people in a region considering local population demographics, population density, daily number of contacts in the absence of social distancing measures, and adherence to social distancing measures. Our model, referred to as COVid-19 Agent-based simulation Model (COVAM), allows transmission from asymptomatic patients, allows both community spread and transmission in the hospitals, accounts for the \""imported\"" cases at the early days of the pandemic, and considers the possibility that some patients with mild to moderate symptoms never receive confirmatory testing for COVID-19. This study demonstrates how COVAM can inform decision-making in three unique urban communities as to how social distancing measures might be adjusted to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent a return to exponential growth in the number of COVID-19 cases.The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 9, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.07.20124859 doi: medRxiv preprint order of the governor in the state of Wisconsin on this date. 20 We assumed that adherence to social distancing remains the same after May 21, 2020.The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 9, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.07.20124859 doi: medRxiv preprint phone data showed that adherence was higher in NYC as compared to Dane County; [17] [18] [19] 21 and 4) number of contacts per person in each day was set to 20 due to significantly higher population density (438/square mile in Dane County vs. 27,755/square mile in NYC), as social network analysis literature reports that population density increases the number of close contacts. 22, 23 These parameters correspond to a theoretical R0 value of 6.68.The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 9, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.07.20124859 doi: medRxiv preprint 3) Timing of easing social distancing. We tested the scenario that social distancing measures are eased on June 1, June 15, and July 1. We assumed that after social distancing measures are eased, due to the heightened awareness of the community, adherence to social distancing drops by 10 and 20 percentage points compared to the adherence levels before easing social distancing measures in each region. For example, in NYC, a drop of 10 percentage points in adherence to social distancing reduces the adherence level from 90% to 80% after social distancing measures are eased. This is consistent with the adherence levels observed in Dane County and Milwaukee after Wisconsin Supreme Court struck down the stay-at-home order of the governor in the state on May 13, 2020. 20 We conducted these experiments only for NYC.We conducted a sensitivity analysis for NYC region on two parameters: probability of testing given a patient experiences mild to moderate symptoms and transmission rates. Testing has been severely limited especially in the early days of epidemic in the U.S., therefore, it is likely that our initial calibration may not have estimated the input parameters correctly. For example, recent data from NYC suggest that one of every five residents tested positive for antibodies for COVID-19. 24 For this purpose, we replaced our base estimate of 75% for the probability of testing with 25% and 50% and recalibrated model parameters and reevaluated all of the scenarios described above. Similarly, we reduced the transmission rate by 50% (from a base estimate of 0.0418 to 0.0209 for the probability of transmission from a patient experiencing mild to moderate symptoms to a susceptible patient when a close contact occurs), recalibrated model parameters, and reevaluated all of the scenarios. We ran 100 replications for each experiment and report only mean values since the standard errors were very low..

The sensitivity analysis on the probability of testing and transmission rates showed that even if a lower probability of testing or a lower rate of transmission were to be used, the overall trends in base-case runs would still hold (Appendix Figures 1-6 , and Appendix Tables 3-11 ).The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 9, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.07.20124859 doi: medRxiv preprint further found keeping a high level of adherence after easing social distancing measures has a major impact on the number of cases, implying that cities and regions should strongly encourage the community to maintain behaviors that reduce the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 such as wearing masks. The accuracy of COVAM for predicting the current outbreak and its ability to estimate the impact of easing social distancing measures at the regional level demonstrates its unique value for informing current and future policies. Our findings clearly show that one-sizefits-all strategies are suboptimal and that context-and region-specific policies are needed when considering implementing and easing social distancing measures.Some opponents of stay-at-home policies are motivated by the prospects of achieving herd immunity as a reason for easing current social distancing measures that are in place. 25 However, herd immunity is only possible if infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in solid immunity, which is unknown at this time. Moreover, the correlates of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be identified. 25 In the absence of this understanding, social distancing is the most effective tool to prevent further spread of SARS-CoV-2. To date, social distancing measures and adherence to those measures have resulted in halting exponential growth in the daily case counts of COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and major cities and urban communities in the U.S. have yet to return to pre-exponential growth levels of transmission. COVAM demonstrates that premature easing of social distancing measures and adherence to these measures will result in rapid return to exponential growth of COVID-19 cases and negate progress made to date in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in communities, managing the healthcare capacities of health systems, and preventing larger numbers of deaths.Our study has limitations, most of which are due to limited available data and uncertainty regarding SARS-CoV-2. We make simplifying assumptions such as asymptomatic patients .

To overcome this limitation, we assumed a high level of adherence after the easing of social distancing measures to provide a conservative estimate on the effect of easing social distancing measures.There are also several limitations related to the modeling approach. Our calibration procedure used a simple trial-error approach as opposed to a full-scale calibration in which all possible combinations of the input parameter values within a plausible range are tested. 28 Due to the computational intensity of a more formal and detailed calibration procedure, our calibration process may have not identified the best parameter combinations to represent the pandemic.Additionally, we used mean parameter estimates instead of probability distributions for input parameters to reduce computational time, although we do not expect this simplification to substantively change our results.In conclusion, our model demonstrates that the delayed implementation, lower adherence to, and premature easing of social distancing generally result in increased cases of COVID-19 in urban areas of the U.S. The magnitude of impact, however, varies significantly by region.These findings highlight the importance of region-specific considerations, and ideally modeling, as inputs to making policy decisions for a given region..

[17] [18] [19] For instance, the average number of daily close contacts per person in New York City (NYC) is estimated as 20, therefore, a 70% adherence level reduces the number of such contacts to 6 per day per person leading to the slowing of transmission.

However, there is uncertainty in the effectiveness of such measures for specific regions with varying population demographics and different levels of adherence to social distancing. The objective of this paper is to determine the impact of social distancing measures in unique regions. METHODS: We developed COVid-19 Agent-based simulation Model (COVAM), an agent-based simulation model (ABM) that represents the social network and interactions among the people in a region considering population demographics, limited testing availability, imported infections from outside of the region, asymptomatic disease transmission, and adherence to social distancing measures. We adopted COVAM to represent COVID-19-associated events in Dane County, Wisconsin, Milwaukee metropolitan area, and New York City (NYC). We used COVAM to evaluate the impact of three different aspects of social distancing: 1) Adherence to social distancing measures; 2) timing of implementing social distancing; and 3) timing of easing social distancing. RESULTS: We found that the timing of social distancing and adherence level had a major effect on COVID-19 occurrence. For example, in NYC, implementing social distancing measures on March 5, 2020 instead of March 12, 2020 would have reduced the total number of confirmed cases from 191,984 to 43,968 as of May 30, whereas a 1-week delay in implementing such measures could have increased the number of confirmed cases to 1,299,420. Easing social distancing measures on June 1, 2020 instead of June 15, 2020 in NYC would increase the total number of confirmed cases from 275,587 to 379,858 as of July 31. CONCLUSION: The timing of implementing social distancing measures, adherence to the measures, and timing of their easing have major effects on the number of COVID-19 cases.

Many studies suggested the presence of complement components at the alveolar epithelium, where inhaled airborne particles and microorganisms are deposited. [1] [2] [3] In addition, the complement system has been implicated in the development of acute lung diseases induced by highly pathogenic viruses including influenza A virus H1N1, 4 H5N1, 5 H7N9, 6 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov), 7 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Cov). 8 However, the specific contributions of complement to lung diseases based on innate and adaptive immunity are just beginning to emerge. Elucidating the role of complement-mediated immune regulation in these diseases will help identify new targets for therapeutic interventions. 9 Complement activation leads to the formation of bioactive molecules, including the anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a, and the lytic membrane attack complex (C5b-9). 10 The complement-activated product C5a is a strong chemoattractant and is involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and T lymphocytes, in activation of phagocytic cells and release of granulebased enzymes and generation of oxidants. 10 C5a also displays other powerful biological activities including inducing ''cytokine storm.'' On the other hand, blockade of C5a signaling has demonstrated potential benefits in the treatment of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by highly pathogenic viruses. In this article, we summarize recent developments in our understanding of the role of C5a in mediating aute lung injury induced by highly pathogenic viruses."", ""ACUTE LUNG INJURY INDUCED BY HIGHLY PATHOGENIC VIRAL INFECTIONS"": ""Highly pathogenic virus Due to high mutation rates of viruses, every several years to decades a highly pathogenic virus emerges. Especially in the recent decades, there were more than five highly pathogenic viruses such as SARS coronavirus in 2002, avian influenza A/H5N1 virus in 1997, H1N1 virus in 2009, H7N9 virus in 2013, and MERS coronavirus in 2012. As exemplified by coronaviruses and influenza viruses, bats and birds are natural reservoirs for providing viral genes during evolution of new virus species and viruses for interspecies transmission. 11, 12 This is the primary cause of an outbreak by jumping directly from bird to human. 13 In two months, 536 laboratory-confirmed cases and 145 deaths have been reported globally. 14 There is an H5N1 vaccine for human use, but there is currently no H7N9, SARS or MERS vaccine available. Current vaccination strategies are still inadequate at providing protection against epidemic outbreaks. Thus, it is urgent to explore the mechanism by which highly pathogenic viruses induce diseases.Acute lung injury induced by highly pathogenic viral infections Although highly pathogenic virus infections have the different epidemiology, there is a similar rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 15 For example, histopathological changes in the lung from patients infected with H5N1 are highly similar to those of patients with SARS. 16 Except for influenza A H5N1 virus, avian influenza A H7N9 virus in 2013 also caused severe pneumonia. 17 Postmortem biopsy of 3 patients infected with H7N9 in 2013 showed acute diffuse alveolar damage: patient 1, who died 8 days after symptom onset, had intra-alveolar hemorrhage, whereas patients 2 and 3, who died 11 days after symptom onset, had pulmonary fibro proliferative changes. 18 Patients infected with H5N1 develop rapidly progressive pneumonia, further resulting in ALI or ARDS. 19, 20 ALI may be a critical cause of death in patients with H5N1 infection. 19, 21 Like H5N1 infection, H7N9 also causes serious lung pathology. In addition, SARS-CoV infection caused ALI that may progress to life-threatening ARDS. MERS-CoV infection resulted in a more severe pneumonia than SARS-CoV infection. 22 Respiratory distress is the most common cause of death in patients infected with highly pathogenic virus. In terms of therapy, lung protective ventilation is the cornerstone of supportive care. 23 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is routinely used in many centers for the treatment of severe respiratory tract infections. However, due to few effective treatment options, ALI is often fatal for patients infected with highly pathogenic viruses. This suggests that serious lung pathology should be of particular concern."", ""COMPLEMENT AND C5a ACTIVATION IN ACUTE LUNG INJURY INDUCED BY HIGHLY PATHOGENIC VIRAL INFECTIONS"": ""After a microorganism infection begins, the host quickly activates the complement system to clear infected pathogens. 24 During the complement activation, the high levels of products such as C5a are commonly involved in exacerbated inflammatory reactions that can cause direct harm to the host following infections. [25] [26] [27] IAV belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family with single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus, 28 and has the capacity to activate the complement system. 29 In addition, the avian influenza hemagglutinins typically bind alpha 2-3 sialic acid receptors, whereas human influenza hemagglutinins bind alpha 2-6 sialic acid receptors. 30 Thus, H5N1 replicates in the lower respiratory tract, then causes complement activation. 31 This suggests that upon influenza infection, the high levels of C3 and C5 including fragments C3a and C5a are produced.Complement activation possibly contributes to the observed tissue damage in severe viral infection. 32 Studies demonstrated that ALI in H5N1-infected mice was caused by excessive complement activation such as release of C5a. 5 Thus, complement activation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of virus-induced acute lung injury.Among the complement activation products, the anaphylatoxin C5a is one of the most potent inflammatory peptides. 33 Increased levels of C5a were found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum from patients infected with fatally H1N1 pandemic virus. 4, 34 C5a had also been found to increase in BALF of mice infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 but not following seasonal IAV infection. 35 On the other hand, BALF from recovered patients with ARDS demonstrated significantly reduced C5a-dependent chemotactic activity. 36 Thus, C5a might play a critical role in the pathogenesis of virus-induced acute lung injury."", ""THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING C5a-MEDIATED ACUTE LUNG INJURY INDUCED BY HIGHLY PATHOGENIC VIRAL INFECTIONS"": ""C5a-mediated inflammatory cells migrate into lung tissue Compared to normal controls, SARS patients had increased cellularity of BALF with increased alveolar macrophages. 37 Thus, mononuclear cell infiltration might have an important role in the pathogenesis of ALI induced by highly pathogenic viruses like SARS.Anaphylatoxin C5a has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ARDS by mediating neutrophil attraction, aggregation, activation, and subsequent pulmonary endothelial damage. [38] [39] [40] [41] Reversely, C5adependent chemotactic activity is significantly decreased in recovered patients with ARDS. 36 These suggest that C5a-mediated mobilization and activation of immune cells might be the central events to tissue injury caused by highly pathogenic viral infections.Two chemoattractants C5a and interleukin 8 (IL-8) can be synthesized by cells in the lung (e.g., macrophages, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and neutrophils). 33 IL-8 levels have also been found to correlate with neutrophil numbers and the degree of lung dysfunction. 42 C5a could strongly amplify IL-8 expression from human whole blood cells induced by lipopolysaccharides and other types of toll-like receptors agonists via extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1/2 and p38, but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase. 43 The data suggest that C5a might be a critical effector molecule to mediate lymphocyte attraction by itself or indirectly by enhancing the production of IL-8.Altogether, C5a-mediated lymphocyte attraction plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of ALI induced by highly pathogenic viruses."", ""C5a-mediated neutrophil extracellular traps"": ""Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are primarily composed of DNA from neutrophils, which bind pathogens with antimicrobial proteins. NETs are beneficial in antimicrobial defense and can help fight against invading pathogens. However, an excess of NETs contributes to the pathology of a number of diseases including those of the lung. 44 NETs are found in infection-related ALI models of influenza virus. 45, 46 In vitro studies demonstrated that C5a, in association with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, is able to induce the release of NETs. 47 C5a is also able to activate macrophages and endothelial cells and to promote vascular leakage and the release of NETs. 10 Thus, NETs are induced by C5a during IAV infection and are associated with alveolar damage in IAV-induced pneumonitis. 45 The excess of NET components are potent factors in lung injury. NET increases the permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier by cleaving endothelial actin cytoskeleton, E-cadherin and VEcadherin. 48 The antimicrobial peptide LL-37 in NET structures presents cytotoxic and proapoptotic properties towards endothelial and epithelial cells. 49 NET also induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines. 48 The data suggest that C5a-mediated neutrophil extracellular traps aggravate ALI in patients infected with highly pathogenic virus.C5a-mediated release of reactive oxygen species C5a is a strong chemoattractant for neutrophils and monocytes; it then activates these cells to generate oxidative burst with release of 10 A study demonstrated that ROS are primary pathogenic molecules in pneumonia from mice infected with influenza virus. 50 The amount and duration of exposure of generated ROS, released from respiratory, immune, and inflammatory cells, determined the extent of lung damage. 50 In lung fibroses, inflammatory cells produce a significantly greater amount of ROS. Critically, antioxidant treatment significantly reduces lung damage and mortality in influenza-infected mice. 51 These studies demonstrated a critical role of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) in virus-induced epithelial damage.C5a-C5aR interaction plays a critical role in oxidative burst. 52 Interception of C5a/C5aR signaling with a C5aR antagonist significantly inhibited oxidative burst in neutrophils induced with E. coli. Similarly, anti-C5a blocked the oxidative burst in whole blood induced with Neisseria meningitides. 53 Phosphorylation of p47 phox is essential for assembly of NADPH oxidase and the subsequent production of O 2 and H 2 O 2 . 10 C5a is a strong activator of mitogen-activated protein kinase (including p42/p44), which is an important kinase for p47 phox phosphorylation.Except for directly affecting tissue damage, oxidant production might also be involved in signal transduction pathways. IL-8 expression is enhanced by the oxidant sensitive transcription factor nuclear factor-kB 54 activated in the lungs of influenza-infected mice. 55 This means that oxygen-derived free radicals might exert much greater effects on the pathogenesis of the disease by indirectly inducing other proinflammatory mediators. Thus, C5a-mediated oxygen-derived free radicals are thought to be important events in the pathogenesis of the disease.C5a-mediated release of histones Histones are essential regulators of genome function in eukaryotic cells. The NS1 protein of influenza A H3N2 subtype possesses a histone-like sequence (histone mimic), and could target the human RNA polymerase-associated factor 1 transcription elongation complex which has a crucial role in the antiviral response. 56 Thus, the virus used NS1 histone mimic to suppress human RNA polymerase-associated factor 1 transcription elongation complex-mediated antiviral response.Diversely modified histone regulates gene replication, repair and transcription. After activation with influenza, H3K4me3 reduced association of interferon I (IFN-I) and IFN-III promoters in dendritic cells (DCs) to suppress antiviral gene expression. 57 In contrast to IFNs, the association of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) promoter was not disturbed. 57 Histone can be excreted into cells to reduce intracellular histone to suppress antiviral gene expression. In the setting of ALI both in humans and in mice, histone presence has been found in BALF. 58 In addition, when polymorphonuclear leukocytes are incubated in vitro or in vivo with C5a, neutrophil extracellular histones-contained extracellular traps (NETs) develop. 59 These results suggest that engagement of C5a with its receptors led to the appearance of extracellular histones in BALF.Extracellular histones significantly enhance inflammatory response by inducing nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. 58 Furthermore, airway instillation of histones resulted in intense lung injury and inflammation, together with fibrin clots in pulmonary veins. 60 C5a-mediated release of histones has an important contribution to the pathogenesis of ALI."", ""C5a-mediated the upregulation of adhesion molecules"": ""The process of leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells is the first critical step in neutrophil migration into an area of inflammation.Adhesion molecules on the surface of endothelial cells have an important role in inflammatory cell migration. In fact, C5a can regulate the expression of adhesion molecules. 61 C5a directly activates endothelial cells to upregulate adhesion molecules such as P-selectin. In addition, C5a and TNF-a cooperate to enhance upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and E-selectin. 62 Thus, C5a is an effective mediator in the first step in inflammatory cell migration into the lung.Adhesion molecules on the surface of inflammatory cells also have an important role in inflammatory cell migration. In vitro studies demonstrated upregulation of CD1lb/CD18 expression on neutrophils induced by C5a. 10 In addition, C5a also induced the expression of b1 and b2 integrin on blood neutrophils. 63, 64 Thus, enhanced adhesive interactions of neutrophils to endothelial cells promote inflammatory cell migration into inflammatory sites.The adhesion molecules effectively enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a production by pulmonary macrophages, which, in turn, promotes the inflammatory response. 62 Blockade of CDllb, CD18, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, or P-selectin significantly reduced ALI damage by neutrophil content of the lungs. 65 Anti-C5a might protect tissue injury in various organs by limiting neutrophil sequestration through downregulating the expression of adhesion molecules. 10 These studies suggest that C5a-mediated upregulation of adhesion molecules promotes the inflammatory response.C5a-mediated adaptive immune response C5a induces innate immune cells including mast cells, neutrophils, and macrophages to release cytokines such as IL-12, TNF-a and macrophage inflammatory proteins-1a. 66 IL-12 is a strong activator of CD8 1 T cells, whereas TNF-a promotes transendothelial migration of T cells by up-regulating vascular adhesion molecules and induces IFN-c expression in T cells. 66 These data demonstrate that C5a indirectly induces adaptive immune response by activating innate immune cells.Apart from innate immune cells, human DCs 67,68 and T cells 69 also express the C5a receptor (C5aR, CD88). Thus, C5a is also a potent chemoattractant for human T cells, 69,70 B cells, 71 and DCs. 67, 68, 72, 73 In addition, during the early inflammatory stage of a pathogen infection, DCs used C5a as a homing signal to take up Ag, and then were primed for helping T-cell function. 74 Thus, C5a induces adaptive immune response by recruiting for DCs.CD28 and CD40L on T cells are important signaling for T-cell proliferation and differentiation induced by interaction of locallyproduced C5a with C5aR on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Accordingly, C5a could not activate Cd80 2/2 Cd86 2/2 and Cd40 2/2 APCs to induce T cell activation. 75 The data suggest that the local interaction of C5a and C5aR on APCs is critical to CD4 1 T cell proliferation and differentiation.The binding of the C5a to the C5aR also plays an important role in CD8 1 T cell responses. 74 CD8 1 T cell activation during influenza infection requires C5a, which acts as a chemoattractant for T lymphocytes. 69, 76 Thus, it is conceivable that C5a might elicit CD8 1 T cell response upon the input stimuli. Accordingly, C5aR antagonist reduced the frequency and absolute numbers of flu-specific CD8 1 T cells."", ""C5a-mediated cytokines storm"": ""In patients infected with influenza A virus like H5N1, Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b, IL-8, and IL-6 play a major role in mediating and amplifying ALI and ARDS by stimulating by chemotaxis C5a. 77 C5a induces innate immune cells including mast cells, neutrophils, and monocytes/macrophages to release proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-12, TNF-a and macrophage inflammatory proteins-1a. 64 In addition, C5a also stimulates adaptive immune cells such as T and B cells to release cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-8. 78, 79 Many cytokines, triggered by highly pathogenic viruses like H5N1, has been called a ''cytokine storm''. 80 Cytokines were rapidly induced at 24h post infection with H5N1. 81 The pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1b and TNF-a might contribute to the severity of disease by promoting maximal lung inflammation caused by H5N1 viral infection. 82 Compared to healthy volunteers, H7N9-infected patients have significantly higher levels of cytokines such as IL-6, IFN-c-inducible protein 10, IL-10, IFN-c, and TNF-a. 83 A dangerous cytokine storm also occurs in SARS. The representative SARS-CoV ssRNAs had powerful immunostimulatory activities in inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-12. 84 Elevated levels of some proinflammatory cytokines including moncyte chemoattractant protein-1, transforming growth factor-beta1, TNF-a, IL-1, and IL-6, produced by cells infected by SARS-CoV, might cause ALI. 85 In addition, a cytokine could induce other cytokines to further enhance the proinflammatory response. Take for example, elevated levels of TNF-a induced other cytokines like IL-6. 86 Thus, cytokine storm plays an important role in ALI.Anti-TNF-a (etanercept) significantly reduced the damage of ALI. 87 The inhibition of macrophage migration inhibitory factor alleviated H5N1 influenza virus pneumonia in murine model by causing a significant reduction in pulmonary inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a and IFN-c-inducible protein 10 88 A widely used antiviral agent Arbidol hydrochloride efficiently inhibits both H1N1 strains and diminishes both viral replication and acute inflammation through suppression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-a. 89 These studies indicate that blockade of cytokine storm is effective in treatment of infections with highly pathogenic virus."", ""C5a-mediated immune paralysis"": ""The severe H7N9 patients were in a state of immune paralysis with general leukopenia, low antigen-presenting capacity and impaired T cell response. 90 Those suffering fatal infections with H7N9 have particularly low proportions of peripheral blood T lymphocyte subgroups. 91 Previous studies have demonstrated that C5a induces thymocyte apoptosis, which in turn results in decreased number of T cells in circulation and attendant immunosuppression. 10, 92 This suggests that in a striking contrast to neutrophils, thymocytes apparently receive pro-apoptotic signals from C5a.During SARS-CoV infection, IL-6 and IL-8 induced by C5a inhibits the T-cell-priming ability of DCs. 93 Compared to significant up-regulation of inflammatory chemokines, the SARS-CoV-infected DCs showed low expression of antiviral cytokines (IFN-a, IFN-b, IFN-c,  and IL-12p40) . 94 These studies are in accordance with the conclusion that the N-protein of SARS-CoV induced ALI by resulting in imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. 95 Many inflammatory and anti-viral genes were differentially expressed in SARS patients. Plenty of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-a, and IL-8 significantly increased, whereas a number of IFNstimulated genes like double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, interferon-induced guanylate-binding protein-1 and 2, C-X-C motif chemokine 10 decreased in the acute severe case. 96 Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV viruses were unable to significantly stimulate the expression of antiviral cytokines (IFN-a and IFN-b) but induced comparable levels of TNF-a and IL-6. 8 C5a-C5aR interaction might potentiate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and/or enhance the expression of proapoptotic factors, such as TNF-a, which has been linked to thymocyte apoptosis, in turn reducing the expression of antiviral cytokines. This suggests that C5a-mediated immune paralysis plays a critical role in mediating pathogenic damage in severe patients infected with highly pathogenic virus like H7N9."", ""THE EFFECT OF BLOCKING C5a ON ACUTE LUNG INJURY INDUCED BY HIGHLY PATHOGENIC VIRAL INFECTIONS"": ""To evaluate the effect of C5a blockade, OmCI, a potent arthropodderived inhibitor of C5 activation that binds to C5 and prevents release of C5a by complement activation, was used to treat mice infected with H1N1 pandemic virus. OmCI significantly inhibited neutrophil and macrophage infiltration in the airways, NETs formation, death of leukocytes, lung epithelial injury and overall lung damage. 4 The study suggests that targeting C5a could be a promising approach to reduce excessive inflammatory reactions associated with the severe forms of IAV infections.C5aR was found to be expressed on upper (bronchial) and lower (alveolar) airway epithelial cells. An adenovirus construct (siRNA) was used to silence mRNA for C5aR in the lung and resulted in buildup of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and lower levels of proinflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. 97 Antagonism of C5a receptors also significantly inhibited the development of ARDS induced by intravenous infusion of cobra venom factor, including neutrophil migration and bronchoalveolar vascular leakage, blood pressure alterations, pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-a levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. 98 The study indicates that C5a signaling greatly contributes to inflammation and injury in the lung and was targeted to treat highly pathogenic virus infection. In addition, interception of C5a signaling has recently shown promising beneficial effects in small animal models of ALI/ARDS by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines. 99 Polyclonal anti-C5a antibody led to significantly reduced inflammation in lungs, alleviating ALI in H5N1-infected mice. 5 The study indicates that inhibition of C5a might be an effective clinical intervention for H5N1-induced ALI. However, studies in knockout mice demonstrated that C3 was required for protection from influenza infection, proper viral clearance, and associated with changes in cellular infiltration. 35 The data are in accordance with the fact that complement C5a is the leading mediator of the over-inflammatory response which induced ALI, whereas the lytic membrane attack complex (C5b-9) provide a protective role in controlling viral infection. Thus, we developed a neutralized humanized anti-human C5a antibody which only blocked C5a effects but did not affect the formation of C5b-9 membrane attack complex.In vitro experiments demonstrated that a novel, neutralizing, humanized anti-human C5a antibody blocked the ability of C5a to induce granulocytes to express CD11b while not affecting the ability of C5b to form the membrane attack complex. African green monkeys were inoculated with H7N9 virus and then treated intravenously with anti-human C5a antibody. Anti-C5a treatment in H7N9-infected monkeys substantially attenuated ALI by reducing the lung infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils, and the levels of inflammatory mediators. 6 The data suggest that humanized anti-human C5a antibody might provide a potential therapeutic reagent for H7N9-infected patients. 100 The role of C5a in the different viral infections and the effect of C5a blockade on acute lung injury were described in Table 1 that the neutralized humanized anti-human C5a antibody would be a potential therapeutic option for H5N1-infected patients. 100 "", ""CONCLUDING REMARKS"": ""The complement system, a part of innate immunity, plays a critical role in host defense against pathogens. Unregulated complement activation is likely to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of lung diseases. The complement-activated product C5a displays powerful biological activities in the activation of phagocytic cells, generation of oxidants, release of histones and cytokine storm, and so on. 10 In particular, cytokine storm is believed to be responsible for many of the deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic, 101 during the SARS epidemic in 2003, 7 MERS-Cov in 2014, 8 and the human deaths from H1N1, 4 H5N1 102 and H7N9. 6 There is growing awareness that there are key similarities in the contribution to the cytokine storm and the manifestation of lung pathology among the chronic respiratory diseases, 103 and the cause of death such as bleeding from Ebola virus. 104 C5a, as a key trigger to induce cytokine storm, could be an ideal target for many lung inflammatory diseases, and it would be important to assess the therapeutic potentials of C5a blockade in human clinical trials. We have evidence that humanized anti-C5a antibody greatly reduced lung histopathologic injury, as well as decreased lung infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-a in a monkey model of ALI induced by H7N9 6 and herbicide, paraquat (Shihui Sun et al, unpublished data). Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that blockade of C5a with a humanized anti-human C5a antibody would be a potential therapeutic target for highly pathogenic viral infection-induced acute lung injury. Anti-C5a Ab treatment also reduced lung injury and neutrophil infiltration especially on Day 5 after H5N1 virus infection. Also, anti-C5a Ab treatment increased survival rate, with 50% mortality in the C5a Ab group compared with 100% mortality in the control group on day 9 after H5N1 virus challenge."", ""5"": ""HPAI H5N1 virus infected murine model H5N1 influenza virus infected mice had increased levels of C5a activation byproducts as compared to mice infected with either seasonal or pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses."", ""5, 35"": ""H7N9-infected monkey model Anti-C5a treatment in H7N9-infected monkeys substantially attenuated ALI: it markedly reduced the lung histopathological injury and decreased the lung infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils.

Unregulated complement activation is likely to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by highly pathogenic virus including influenza A viruses H5N1, H7N9, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. In highly pathogenic virus-induced acute lung diseases, high levels of chemotactic and anaphylatoxic C5a were produced as a result of excessive complement activaiton. Overproduced C5a displays powerful biological activities in activation of phagocytic cells, generation of oxidants, and inflammatory sequelae named “cytokine storm”, and so on. Blockade of C5a signaling have been implicated in the treatment of ALI induced by highly pathogenic virus.

The RNA genome is enclosed in a helical nucleocapsid structure formed by association with nucleocapsid proteins (N). The virions are enveloped and contain three virus-specific glycoproteins of 180 (S), 65 (HE), and 23 kDa (M) (4, 5) . The S (spike) glycoprotein forms the projecting peplomers of the virus, contains neutralizing epitopes, binds target cells, and is required for viral infectivity (4) . M is a transmembrane protein (8) the function of which is not yet clear. The HE glycoprotein contains an esterase activity (7, 8) and shares sequence and functional homology with the influenza C hemagglutinin (9) . Its expression appears to be optional in murine coronaviruses. In bovine coronavirus (BCV), the HE protein has been found to contribute to viral infectivity (10) .The structural proteins of MHV are translated from virus-specific subgenomic mRNAs in the infected cells. These mRNAs have a 3'-coterminal nested-set structure (I 1, 12) and only their 5'-end terminal unique regions, which include more than one open reading frame in some mRNAs, are utilized for translation (13, 14) . The S protein is translated from mRNA 3, HE from mRNA 2-1, which is synthesized only by certain strains of MHV (9, and M from mRNA 6. The 5'-end of the genomic RNA of MHV contains a leader sequence of ' To whom correspondence and reprint requests should be addressed.approximately 70 nucleotides (15, 18) , which is also present at the 5'-end of every subgenomic RNAs. At the 3'-end of the leader RNA, there are several repeats of a pentanucleotide sequence UCUAA, whose repeat number varies among different MHV strains (17). The number of UCUAA repeats appears to correlate with the efficiency of transcription of specific MHV genes. For instance, the JHM(3) strain of MHV, which contains three UCUAA repeats at the 3'-end of the leader RNA, makes only a small quantity of HE protein. In contrast, the JHM(2) strain with two UCUAA repeats makes a large quantity of this structural glycoprotein (5, 17) .Among many strains of MHV, JHM is of particular interest because of its capacity to cause neurological diseases in murine species (18) (19) (20) . lntracerebral (ic) or intranasal inoculation of susceptible mice and rats with the JHM virus often results in acute, subacute, and chronic infections of the central nervous system (CNS). The symptoms of these infections depend on the age of the animal, and range from encephalitis, associated with lesions in the gray matter of the CNS, to demyelination, characterized by hindleg paralysis or paresis (18, 21, 22) . In view of the interesting pathogenic properties of the JHM virus, extensive studies have been undertaken to understand the genetic basis for MHV-induced neurological diseases. Studies on monoclonal antibody-resistant MHV variants and on variants isolated from persistent infections have shown that mutations in the peplomer protein S are associated with marked variations in disease patterns of these virus isolates, suggesting that this structural gly-883 0042.6822/91 $3.00 CopyrIght 0 1991 by Academic Press, Inc. All rlghrs of reproduction I\"" any form reserved coprotein plays an important role in the establishment of coronavirus infection and pathogenesis (23, 24) . The M protein may also play a role in the development of viral disease since several monoclonal antibodies against this protein can alter the pathogenicity of the virus (25). The role of HE protein in MHV pathogenesis has not been studied.Recently, two JHM variant viruses At1 If have been isolated from the brain and the spinal cord, respectively, of a single Wistar Furth rat with a JHM-induced demyelinating disease. The virus isolated from the spinal cord was named At 11 f cord, while the other, At 11 f brain, was independently isolated from the brain of the same rat (26). The At1 If cord variant differs from the parental JHM virus in its pathogenic properties in that it induces a chronic demyelinating disease in Wistar Furth rats when inoculated intracerebrally, independently of their age. Also, unlike the parental JHM virus, the At1 1 f cord variant forms massive syncytia and replicates extensively in the murine oligodendroglioma cell line G26-24. In contrast, the At1 If brain isolate produced an acute encephalitis when inoculated into 2and lo-day-old Wistar Furth rats. Both the brain and the spinal cord isolates displayed a different pattern of virus-specific mRNAs from the parental JHM virus in the infected cells (26). However, the brain isolate did not replicate as well as the At1 If cord variant in the G26-24 cell line and did not form syncytia (26). The parental JHM virus and the At1 If cord virus were plaque-purified three times and passaged less than ten times in L-2 cells. Both the plaque-purified and unpurified stocks of the At1 1 f brain variant were used in this study. The unpurified At1 If brain variant used had been passaged in G26-24 and L-2 cells less than ten times, and had the same passage history as the one used previously for its biological characterization (26).To obtain a better understanding of the genetic changes that may contribute to the altered biological and pathogenic properties of the At1 1 f brain and cord isolates, we have begun to characterize the genomic structure of these viruses. In this paper, we have identified large deletions within the genes encoding the S and HE proteins of these variant viruses.To examine the virus-specific RNA patterns of these variants and the parental JHM strain, virus-infected DBT cells treated with actinomycin D (2.5 pg/ml) were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate between 5 and 9 hr p.i. At the end of this period, RNA was extracted from the infected cells, denatured, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis according to the published method (27). Because some mRNAs of the parental JHM virus were synthesized only in a very small quantity, intracellular RNA from another well-characterized MHV, JHM (2), was included for comparison. JHM (2) (2). the parental JHM and the neural isolates At1 If brain and cord. The viruses were grown in mouse astrocytoma cell line DBT (34) and labeled with [3ZP]orthophosphate between 5 and 9 hr p.i. in the presence of actinomycin D (2.5 rg/ml). RNA was then extracted from the infected cells, denatured with glyoxal and DMSO, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel as described (27). This photograph is a composite of different time exposures of the same gel. a JHM strain maintained in laboratories in Japan (17, 29). As shown in Fig. 1 , all the virus strains examined synthesized seven to eight mRNA species in varying quantity. The size of several of these mRNAs appeared different; most notably, the mRNA 3 of the At1 lf cord isolate was smaller than those of the parental JHM strain and of the brain isolate but similar to that of JHM (2), which has a deletion of 423 nucleotides in the S gene (28). In addition, the sizes of mRNA 2 and mRNA 2-1 of both neural isolates were smaller than those of the corresponding mRNA synthesized by the JHM(2) strain; the parental JHM virus synthesizes only negligible quantity of mRNA 2-l (see below). As expected from the nested-set structure of MHV mRNAs, the mRNA 2 of the parental JHM strain is larger than that of JHM(2) because of the presence of the deletion in gene 3 of JHM(2) (28). The amounts of mRNA 2 in both neural isolates were low; however, a longer exposure clearly showed that mRNA 2 of both neural isolates was smaller than that of the parental JHM strain (data not shown). This result suggests that there are internal deletions in genes 2-1, 3, and possibly also gene 2 of the neural JHM variants. However, these size differences could also be due to aberrant transcrip- tional initiation. Furthermore, because MHV mRNAs have a nested-set structure, the genetic alterations affecting the size of mRNA 2 could be the result of deletions or insertions in the coding sequences of mRNAs 2-1 or 3.To characterize the structure of mRNA 3 of the At1 If cord isolate, we first determined by Tl -oligonucleotide fingerprinting analysis whether the coding region and leader sequence of mRNA 3 of this variant virus contained any missing or altered sequence. The oligonucleotide map showed that the cord isolate lacked oligonucleotide spots numbered 4, 9, and 19 , which have previously been mapped contiguously to the middle portion of this gene (27) (data not shown). This result suggests that the smaller size of mRNA 3 of At1 If cord isolate is most likely caused by a deletion in the coding sequence of gene 3. The site of the deletion was determined by direct sequencing (28) of the purified genomic RNA of both the parental JHM virus and the variant viruses. After identifying the approximate site of the deletion by preliminary sequencing, the region from nucleotides 842 to 1830 of gene 3 was completely sequenced. Figure 2 shows that, when compared with the sequence of the parental JHM, gene 3 of the variant virus has a deletion of 441 bases extending from nucleotide 1324 to 1765. The reading frame downstream of the deletion remains unaltered. The rest of the gene 3 sequence is identical with that of the parental virus. Therefore, the smaller size of mRNA 3 of the At1 1 f cord variant is the consequence of a deletion within the coding sequence of gene 3. The loss of 441 nucleotides from base 1324 to 1765 of the gene 3 sequence results in a smaller peplomer protein lacking an internal 147 amino acids.We next examined the size variation of mRNA 2-l. When compared with JHM(2), which makes a large quantity of mRNA 2-l (5) both the brain and spinal cord isolates appeared to have a smaller mRNA 2-l (Fig. 1) . However, because of the nested-set structure of MHV mRNAs, it could not be determined with certainty whether the coding region of gene 2-l had any deletion, since the size comparison of mRNA 2-l was complicated by the size differences in mRNA 3 between these viruses. We therefore performed PCR amplification of the gene 2-l of the parental JHM and the two variant viruses, using two specific primers corresponding to both ends of the gene. The results showed that the gene 2-l of the parental JHM has exactly the same size as that of the published JHM-2 ( is homologous to nucleotides 781-801 of gene 2 located 36 nucleotides upstream from the intergenic site of gene 2-l (5). After an initial denaturation at 94\"" for 2 min, 20 units of AMV reverse transcriptase (Seigakaku) were added and the samples were incubated at 45\"" for 30 min. The cDNA products were then amplified by addition of 2.5 units of Taql DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer-Cetus, Norwalk, CT). Each cycle of amplification consisted of a 1.5.min denaturation at 94\"", followed by 2-min annealing at 58\"", and 3-min extension at 72\"". After 35 cycles, the final product was extended for 10 min. 20-~1 aliquots of the PCR reaction were electrophoresed on a 1.4% agarose gel. trast, the PCR-amplified gene 2-1 of both variants are smaller than that of the parental JHM, suggesting that the gene 2-l of these two variants has a deletion. The sites of the deletion were determined by DNA sequencing of the PCR products and also direct RNA sequencing of the genomic RNAs. The results showed that both variants contain a deletion of 739 nucleotides extending from nucleotide 555 to 1294 of gene 2-1, which translates into a deletion of 246 amino acids in the gene 2-l of both viruses (Fig. 4) . Furthermore, because the reading frame was changed after the deletion, the ORF of this gene in both variant viruses has a capacity to encode a protein of only 182 amino acids. This truncated protein product would be expected to lack the carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain.The finding that the parental JHM did not synthesize an appreciable amount of mRNA 2-1, while both variants do (Fig. l) , is reminiscent of our previous finding with JHM (2) , in which there is a strong correlation between the amount of mRNA 2-l and the number of UCUAA repeats in the leader RNA (5) . Therefore, the leader sequences of these viruses were determined. The results showed that the parental virus has three UCUAA repeats while the variants have two (data not shown). This result is in agreement with the previous findings concerning the transcriptional regulation of this gene (5, 17) .To determine the size of the proteins encoded by the structural genes of these variants, we examined the intracellular virus-specific proteins. Infected cells were pulse labeled with 35S-Translabel (Amersham) for 15 min, and immunoprecipitated with various antibodies. Figure 5A shows that the S protein of the At1 lf cord variant is smaller than that of the JHM parental virus, but similar in size to that of the JHM(2), which has a deletion of 153 amino acids (28). This result is consistent with the presence of a deletion in the S gene of the At1 If cord virus. Figure 5A also shows that the JHM parental virus produced a small amount of HE protein, which has the same size as that produced by the JHM(2)virus, indicating that the mRNA 2-l of the parental JHM virus does not contain a deletion. In contrast, neither of the two neural variants produced this protein. The reason for the failure to detect the HE protein in the variant viruses is not yet clear. This could be due to rapid degradation of the truncated proteins or the failure to initiate translation. We have also examined whether a truncated protein immunoprecipitable with anti-HE antibodies could be detected in purified virions or infected cell media since the truncated protein is expected to lack a C-terminal transmembrane domain; no protein was detected (data not shown). All of the viruses examined synthesized a 30-kDa polypeptide, which was precipitated by an antiserum prepared against the TrpE-MHV fusion protein containing 1 18 amino acids of the predicted gene 2 product (Fig. 5B) . Thus, all of these viruses have an intact gene 2; the differing size of the mRNA 2 in these viruses is due to deletions in the downstream genes.These results showed that the neural variants have undergone multiple changes from the parental virus. Both of them have a large deletion of 739 nucleotides in the HE gene, and the cord variant had an additional deletion of 441 nucleotides in the S gene. In addition, both of them have two UCUAA repeats at the 3'-end of the leader RNA, resulting in the high expression of mRNA 2-1, in contrast to the parental virus, which has three UCUAA repeats and, thus, a small amount of mRNA 2-l. However, the truncated gene product (HE) of mRNA 2-l was not detected in cells infected by either of the variant viruses, while the truncated S protein was expressed by the At1 If cord variant (Fig. 5) . It is possible that these changes have contributed to the changes of biological and pathogenic properties of these viruses.Variation in the size of the S glycoprotein has been observed during both in viva and in vitro passages of MHV. The previously published JHM sequence (30) has been shown to lack 423 nucleotides in the same region of the S gene as the At1 1 f cord variant, although the exact deletion sites are slightly different (28, 31) . A59 virus and several other MHV isolates are also missing from 156 to 474 nucleotides in the same area (28). Thus, this region appears to be prone to deletions FIG. 5. lmmunoprecipitation of MHV-specific intracellular proteins. Virus-infected cells were radiolabeled with 35S-Translabel at 9 hr p.i. for 15 min. Cell lysates were prepared as previously described (7) have reported similar deletions in the S protein of several JHM variants which had been selected for resistance to neutralization with monoclonal antibodies (23). These viruses also display altered pathogenicity in mice similar to that of the At1 If cord isolate. Also, Taguchi et al. have reported the isolation, from both the brain of Lewis rats and primary rat neuronal cultures, of neurotropic JHM variants, which have a larger mRNA 3 (32, 33). Thus, the variation of the sequence in this region of the S gene may be related to the alteration of the pathogenicity of these viruses.The deletion observed in the HE protein of MHV has not previously been described. We have reported the increased synthesis of the HE glycoprotein after in vitro passages, which correlated with the decrease in the number of UCUAA repeats at the 3'-end of the leader (5). Here we observed a similar variation of the UCUAA repeat number during the passage of the virus in the CNS of rats. However, the HE protein was not synthesized as a result of the deletions. It is unlikely that the observed deletions and increased mRNA expression in the neural variants originated from the passaging of these viruses in tissue culture after isolation. In fact, no change in the biological and physical properties of the viruses has been observed during passage of these neural isolates in L-2 and G26-24 cells. Furthermore, we have not detected any changes in the RNA pattern and protein profile of the parental JHM virus after passaging under our culture conditions.It should be noted that the At1 1 f brain isolate initially used in this and a previous study (26) was not cloned because of technical reasons. However, the HE sequence reported here was obtained by direct sequencing of genomic RNA, suggesting that the major population of this variant virus is characterized by a deletion in the HE glycoprotein. We have now confirmed this deletion with several plaque-purified At1 If brain isolates (data not shown). Furthermore, the fact that both the At1 If brain and cord variants have an identical HE sequence suggests that this HE deletion was selected early during JHM infection of the rat (26).The biological significance of this deletion in gene 2-l is more difficult to assess since the gene in both variants probably is not expressed, and these viruses are characterized by strikingly different biological and pathogenic properties. However, the variation in the expression of HE glycoprotein has been associated with the changes in the pathogenic properties of the virus. The JHM(2) virus, which expresses a larger amount of the HE protein, is more neurovirulent than, but does not replicate as well in glial cells as the JHM (3) virus, which synthesizes a small amount of HE (Yokomori eta/., unpublished data). Thus, the amount of this structural glycoprotein may in some way influence the viral pathogenicity, depending on the genetic background of the virus.Whether the truncated mRNA 2-l of both the At1 If brain and cord variants is actually translated in viva is not clear at this time. The sequence analysis of the truncated 2-l gene suggests that the mRNA 2-l should be functional. However, the failure to detect such a protein in infected cell lysates may be due to a short half-life of the protein product. Alternatively, there is a possibility that the translation of this gene may be regulated by additional factors in the virus-infected cells.""}",Localization of extensive deletions in the structural genes of two neurotropic variants of murine coronavirus JHM,"Abstract The intracellular RNA of two neurotropic variants of the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) independently isolated from the brain and spinal cord of an infected Wistar Furth rat were compared with that of the parental virus. The mRNAs corresponding to the genes encoding the peplomer (S) and the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) proteins of the variant viruses were found to be smaller in size. The possible sequence changes were studied by oligonucleotide fingerprinting and direct RNA sequencing. Both variants have a large deletion of 246 amino acids in the carboxy-terminal end of the HE protein. However, this truncated protein was not detected in the infected cells, suggesting either a translational regulation or rapid degradation of the truncated protein in these cells. The variant virus isolated from the spinal cord has a second deletion of 147 amino acids in the amino-terminal half of the S protein. This deletion site corresponds to a hypervariable region where deletions have been frequently noted among MHV variants with different biological properties. These findings suggest that the changes in pathogenic properties of the two neural isolates are associated with drastic alterations of the viral structural glycoproteins.",10.1016/0042-6822(91)90635-o,Elsevier; Medline; PMC,PMC7131313,1850936.0,els-covid,1991-06-30,Virology,,,,38370178.0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229190635O; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1850936/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229190635O,1991.0,paper

The slicing software transforms the 3D design into layered models which the machine tool can easily trace. There are so many slicing software in the market and they are provided under different trademark names such as Cura, PrusaSlicer, MatterControl, Simplify3D, Repetier, ideaMaker, Z-SUITE, Slic3r, IceSL, Slicer-Crafter, Astroprint, 3DPrinterOS, SelfCAD, KISSlicer, Tinkerine Suite, Netfabb Standard including others and each of the software operates differently to achieve the best slicing [3] . \u2022 Conversion of the 3D model into real product: An additive manufacturing machine such as 3D printer and laser convert the 3D model into an actual product using engineering materials such as plastics, metal powders, composites, among others. The material(s) is melted and then allowed to flow according to the G-code (tool path) from the slicing software to create the 3D component.There are various additive manufacturing methods, classified according to the material and machine technology used in the production of the components. According to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM F42-) standards of 2010, there are seven categories of AM processes [4, 5] as listed below.i. Material extrusion techniques ii. Powder bed fusion techniques iii. VAT photopolymerization methods iv. Material jetting techniques v. Binder jetting techniques vi. Sheet lamination techniques vii. Direct energy deposition techniques.The above processes utilize different materials and machines to create 3D printed components and have been extensively reviewed in the literature [6, 7] . Additive manufacturing processes are preferred over conventional processes due to the following advantages.i. Enhanced material efficiency since no material wastage through cutting or machining. ii. There is higher efficiency in resources since these processes do not require auxiliary resources such as tools, jigs, fixtures and so forth. iii. Products of high complexity and intricacy can be manufactured since there are no constraints of the tools. iv. Additive manufacturing processes enhance production flexibility.Although these processes are attractive, they are constrained by some limitations such as size of parts that can be manufactured, surface and microstructural imperfections, and high cost of the AM equipment [7] . The processes are also very slow and therefore they are challenging technologies in mass production.The focus of this book is on the strategies for improving the quality of the fused deposition modelling (FDM) of products. The reason for singling out FDM from all the many AM manufacturing processes is due to its wide range of applications and adoption by many individuals and industries. The FDM process, which is classified as the material extrusion AM technique, is the simplest, affordable and readily available 3D printing technique for polymer-based materials and it has been extensively used in various industries [8] [9] [10] [11] . In the subsequent subtopics, the basics of FDM and its applications, parameters and quality aspects of the process are highlighted."", ""Science of FDM and Applications"": ""Fused deposition modelling (FDM), also known as the material extrusion additive manufacturing technique, utilizes polymers as the raw material (filament). The filament is usually heated to a molten state and then extruded through the nozzle of the machine (3D printer). The nozzle head can move in three degrees of freedom (DoF) to deposit the extruded polymer on the build plate as per the G-code instructions. The principle of the FDM process is illustrated in a schematic diagram in Fig. 1.1 . As shown, the filament is continuously fed through the extruder and nozzle of the machine via the two rollers rotating in opposite directions. The material is deposited on the build plate layer-by-layer until the required product shape and size are achieved. During the layering, the printer nozzle navigates back and forth as per the spatial coordinates of the original CAD model in the G-code files until the desired size and shape of the component is produced. In some FDM systems (3D printers), multiple extrusion nozzles can be used to deposit the polymer constituents especially in cases where components of compositional gradients are required. Usually, the resolution and effectiveness of the extrusion largely depend on the properties of the thermoplastic filament and as such, different 3D printers are designed for specific filament materials. In fact, most of the low-cost FDM 3D printers can process only one type of thermoplastic and polylactic acid (PLA) is the most common material. The components are usually layered onto the build plate (platform), which after printing can be removed by snapping off or soaking in a detergent depending on the type of the thermoplastic. Then, the printed components may be surface cleaned, sanded, painted or milled to enhance both their surface appearance and functionality.There are various materials used in FDM and as stated earlier, PLA is the most adopted material by most 3D printer users at domestic and industrial levels due to the following reasons:i. Polylactic acid (PLA) is a bioplastic and therefore eco-friendly and not harmful to human and animal health. PLA is a green material since it is fabricated from fully renewable sources such as corn, sugarcane, wheat or any other high carbohydrate containing resources [12] . As such, it is recommended for use in making cooldrink cups, deli and food take aways, and packaging containers.ii. PLA has a glass transition temperature ranging between 50 and 70\u00b0C and a melting point temperature ranging between 180 and 220\u00b0C [13] [14] [15] . As such, most low-energy and cost-effective 3D printers can extrude it. It is harder than Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) although it (PLA) has higher friction when compared to ABS and therefore susceptible to extrusion blockage. iii. PLA plastics are compostable and break down quickly upon disposal unlike the other plastics, which have posed serious disposal challenges. Being among the biopolymers, PLA degrades to natural and non-poisonous gases, water, biomass and inorganic salts when it is exposed to natural conditions, hydrolysis or even when incinerated. iv. In its semi-crystalline form, PLA has shown to exhibit good flexural modulus, better tensility and flexural strengths. v. PLA is preferred by most 3D printer users because it does not always need a heated bed for the adhesion to occur between the print and the platform. Graphene-doped PLA, however, presents a great challenge for non-heated bed printers and it does not produce quality prints on non-heated build plates.vi. PLA is commercially available in the market in a variety of colours and textures. This makes it attractive for users, especially domestic and decorative 3D printer handlers. The availability in various colours and texture has expanded the markets for CAD designers and toy enthusiasts. As such, the designers can develop interesting ideas and post in various databases (such as TurboSquid, CG Trader, Shapeways, Cults3D, 3DSquirrel and Thingsverse) where the toy enthusiasts can purchase, download and print with a variety of colours and texture designs of the PLA filaments.Other materials used in FDM processing include polycaprolactone (PCL), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), wood, nylon, metals, carbon fibre, graphene-doped PLA, etc. [13, 16, 17] . These materials are available in different commercial brands and trademarks, as filament wires, and can be purchased through various online stores such as Alibaba, Amazon and so forth. However, it is advised that the buyers should be aware of the chemical composition of the filaments they would like to use based on their applications. From the experience of the authors of this book, most of the filament suppliers do not provide reliable information regarding the chemical constituents of the 3D printing filaments and it is therefore recommended for the users, if necessary, to conduct their analyses to confirm the chemistry of these materials. These analyses can be conducted through phase identification on microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) or more advanced chemical analysis facilities at their disposal.The most common applications of FDM in modern society are listed below.i. The technology has emerged as one of the most progressive methods for producing prototypes and rapid tooling of complex products in low and medium batches [18] . The research currently is on the development of a larger pool of materials for rapid prototyping applications and a lot of literature is available on this subject [19] . ii. There is an increasing adoption of the FDM technique in the toy and other related industries either as a direct manufacturing method [20] or method for producing moulds for injection moulding for such industries [21] . iii. The potential of FDM on mass personalization of products cannot be overemphasized. Due to flexibility and capability to produce intricate profiles, FDM finds application in producing customized products for various applications, for instance, personalized toys, automobile parts, interior design components, implants, beauty products and so forth [20] . iv. The FDM is also being applied in the medical field to produce moulds for casting of implants, medical devices and implants. The most exciting application is the 3D printing of moulds for investment casting of medical implants [22] . In traditional investment casting, there is the use of metallic moulds and sacrificial patterns (e.g. wax) to create the complex shapes of any implant. Therefore, using 3D printed moulds eliminates the need of having to use the sacrificial material and hence reduces cost, time and material wastage. However, there are still challenges associated with the integration of FDM into the investment casting process, that is, poor surface quality; as such, as illustrated in the literature herein (for example, [23] and others) a lot of research is currently underway in improving the surface properties of 3D printed parts and castings obtained from FDM moulds. v. Other applications of FDM include direct printing of electrochemical cells for energy storage devices [24] , micro-trusses for biomedical scaffolding [25] , drug delivery components in the pharmaceutical industry [26] , direct printing of conductors for electronic industry [27] among others."", ""3D Printing and the Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) Pandemic"": ""The recent outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) across the entire world has led to a serious shortage of medical supplies and protective gears. To curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued the following guidelines in February 2020:i. Restricted movement of people across countries. ii. Maintenance of high level of personal hygiene through handwashing with soap and the use of alcohol-based sanitizers. iii. Use of protective gears for mouth, eyes and nose since the virus enters the human body through these membranes. iv. Avoidance of direct contacts among individuals and as such, individuals should keep at least 1-metre distance among themselves, and individuals should avoid handshakes, kissing and hugging. v. Avoiding direct touching/contact of surfaces as much as possible since the virus can survive on the surfaces for around 12 h.These guidelines present a new challenge to both medical and science/engineering fields. As of the writing of this manuscript, the number of infections across the world was more than 1.69 million people with more than 102,000 deaths (www.worldo meters.info/coronavirus/). The number seems to be growing exponentially and this has considerably strained the health and medical sectors in terms of equipment and human capacity. There is an increasing demand for personal protective gear for both the public and medical practitioners. There is also a major shortage of medical ventilators and oxygen valves across the world and with the ban of international flights and travels, consumer-based regions such as Africa must innovate on availing these facilities. With several industries and technologies mobilizing their resources to contribute to this course, the 3D printing community has also been involved in the following ways:i. Availing open-source designs for medical and protective devices: Several individuals and companies have developed designs for face mask frames, oxygen valves, nasal swabs, hands-free door openers and so forth, and availed them for free through the social media platforms and dedicated CAD online forums. ii. Mass production of face masks: Most 3D printing companies such as Strata-sys\u00ae and Prusa Research (Czech) have mobilized their global resources to undertake mass production of masks for both medical practitioners and general public. Individual 3D desktop printer owners across the world have also volunteered to print face masks for medical doctors. For example, in South Africa, a company known as 3D Printing Factor (PTY) Limited located in Johannesburg mobilized all her resources and individual companies to produce face shield frames for medical practitioners for free in partnership with Netcare 911 hospital (www.timeslive.co.za/news "", ""Process Parameters in FDM"": ""Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is influenced by various parameters as summarized in Fig. 1.3 . As shown, the parameters have been classified into two broad categories, namely machine and material parameters. The machine parameters are those parameters the 3D printer user will specify on the slicing software during the generation of the G-code files whereas the material parameters are the properties of the filament material or materials being extruded through the nozzle. Some of the machine parameters, as shown, include the printing speed, raster angle, melt flow rate through the nozzle, airgap, layer thickness, infill density, build orientation and temperature [10, 11] . On the other hand, the material properties such as thermal and mechanical influence both the extrusion and performance of the print. The quality and performance of the printed parts depend on the choice of these parameters and there are various efforts in the literature on evaluating the effects of various parameters on the process and quality of the prints [28] . The build orientation basically indicates the angle at which the longest length is inclined to the base of the build plate. The printed components may be inclined at 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, etc. depending on the choice of the user. Layer resolution indicates the minimum thickness of every layer in one run of the print head and it may vary from a few micrometres to millimetres depending on the accuracy and application of the 3D printer. The extrusion temperature measures the temperature supplied from the external source to the printer heating elements to melt the filament material for easy extrusion whereas the platform temperature is the temperature applied on the build plate to enhance the adhesion of the prints onto the platform and avoid printing failure.It is noted that not all printers have a heated bed and except PLA, all the other materials require heating for them to stick onto the platform. At times, when using non-heated bed with some materials, it has become a common practice to use some sticking fluids such as office glue to enhance the sticking of the first layer of the print. However, from the experience of the authors on 3D printers, it usually affects the dimensional accuracy of the print and gradually blocks the nozzle orifice. Blockage of the nozzle passage may lead to a major failure of the 3D printer and replacement of some parts. During printing, the extrusion temperature should be set within the melting point of the filament material. The thermal properties of the material will influence the conditions of melting and flow through the nozzle of the 3D printer. The chemical properties of the filament material determine the glass transition region and hence the quality of the printed part. Mechanical properties such as strength and friction in molten state determine the rigidity of the printed part and the flowability of the material and whether the material will jam the nozzle or not. The choice, optimization and interrelationships among the process parameters to the print quality are the main objectives of this book and will be detailed using literature case studies and some results obtained from research conducted by the authors in the subsequent chapters."", ""Quality Issues in FDM"": ""As mentioned, FDM involves the layering of molten filament material to create the desired product. The adhesion and fusion between adjacent layers are very critical for quality prints. Additionally, the extrusion conditions of the filament material during the printing process affect the accuracy, quality and performance characteristics of the printed product. The surface roughness of the FDM products is one of the major drawbacks of the quality of this process. Due to the nature of the process, the surfaces of the product mostly exhibit the 'back-and-forth' tracks of the printing nozzle known as the stair stepping effect (shown in Fig. 1.4) . These tracks create terraces on the surface, therefore, leading to relatively high average roughness values (Ra) in the range of micrometres. Such high levels of roughness ranges impede the application of the FDM manufactured products in some fields such as dentistry, biomedical, sensing and so many other areas of applications. The presence of terraces and deeps on the surface of the prints can lead to penetration of moisture and other environmental electrolytes into the inner layers of the product causing further degradation of its properties. For instance, such components (with high roughness) would be very detrimental for use as prosthesis or dental implants as they would react with body fluids, which would cause premature failure of the implants. At times, due to improper extrusion (over-or under-extrusion), there is a lack of enough adhesion between the adjacent layers of the filament material that enhances high roughness and other structural defects such as porosity and cracks. Fig. 1.4 Illustrating the staircasing effect of the FDM parts. In this case, C is known as cusp height, t is the layer thickness and \u03b1 is the angle between the cusp height and layer height The surface roughness of 3D printed parts is predicted using optical surface profilers and microscopes, and various post-processing methods have been adopted to lower the surface roughness. These processes are either mechanical or chemical methods. The most commonly used mechanical methods for enhancing surface quality of FDM prints are machining, sanding, polishing, abrasion and barrel finishing whereas the chemical methods involve painting, coating, heating and vapour deposition [19] . It has been researched and reported in the literature that the choice of each of the methods depends on the materials and performance requirements of the FDM manufactured part. Additionally, at the design stage of the components, the stair stepping effects of the printer can be minimized by optimizing the slicing procedure and print resolution. Using very large slicing thickness reduces the printing time and produces very rough products due to the stair stepping effect. On the contrary, fine slicing reduces the stair stepping effect and reduces the surface roughness although it results in longer printing times, which may impact the other aspects of manufacturing, especially during mass production. The different strategies for slicing have also been shown to influence the quality of the print [29, 30] .The lack of adhesion leading to structural defects considerably affects the dimensional accuracy and mechanical integrity of the FDM printed components. It is obvious that components consisting of a very high density of defects would experience dimensional errors and low properties such as hardness, flexural strength, tensility and compression, and impact strengths. If there is not enough adhesion between the layers, the filament material of the adjacent layers will be forced to flow and compensate between the resulting spaces. This may lead to shrinkage of the component causing dimensional errors between the CAD design and the actual print. Additionally, the presence of pores and cracks within the structure increases the stress raisers within the material such that the component cannot absorb the required energy during its performance without failure. These defects further enhance the propagation of the cracks and the components may not offer suitable and enough mechanical stability for various applications.The flow rate of the filament material during the extrusion and deposition also plays an important role on the quality of the 3D printed parts. The choice of the extrusion and heated bed temperatures are based on the flow characteristics of the filament material. Insufficient flow of the molten material between the layers causes spaces or incomplete adhesion; these weaken the component and failure can easily occur through delamination. The raster angle is also related to the material flow during the FDM process; for instance, Galeja et al. [31] have recently published an article in Materials (Basel) journal titled 'static and dynamic mechanical properties of 3D printed ABS, a function of raster angle.' The study demonstrated that for a range of raster angles 45\u00b0-90\u00b0, the raster angle of 55\u00b0provided the optimal flow of molten ABS during printing and at that angle, the printed ABS samples exhibited excellent static and dynamic responses to mechanical loads.There is a continued effort by the scientific community to understand the influence of the specific parameters to the FDM process and the quality of the printed product. As illustrated in the previous section, the interactions among these parameters in an FDM process are complex and require multi-objective approaches to understand and enhance the quality of manufacturing. The general approach in every manufacturing process including FDM is to understand the influence of the individual parameters followed by evaluating the most significant of those factors and finally determining combined effects (multi-objective) of the parameters. There are several publications describing both of these approaches for enhancing quality in FDM processes [11, 22, [32] [33] [34] . For instance, Perez et al. [35] investigated the effect of five FDM printing parameters (speed, wall thickness, layer height, temperature and printing path) on the surface roughness of PLA printed components using analysis of variance (ANOVA), graphical methods and non-parametric tests. It was reported that wall thickness and layer height were the most significant factors for surface roughness as compared to the other factors. It has been reported that the optimal choice of the wall thickness and enhancement of the geometry of the product (by defining clearly the G-code) eliminates the microstructural defects in FDM PLA products [34] . In another study, Singh et al. [23] optimized the quality of the FDM printed ABS samples for prosthetic investment casting using Taguchi L 18 orthogonal array for the print orientation, fill density, vapour smoothing parameters and heat treatment time of the samples.The choice of the optimal conditions or settings for quality FDM printing during large-scale and mass customization production becomes more difficult. In such cases, the manufacturer is posed with the challenge of quality and time of manufacturing. Usually, 3D printing is a very slow process and most of the Desktop 3D printers are slower compared to the other manufacturing processes. For instance, it is discussed in the literature that the stair-step effects of the FDM process can be eliminated by using very small layer height. Thin layers mean that a very small volume of the material is layered for every run as compared to relatively larger layer thicknesses. It means that longer time is required for enough melting and flow of the filament material within the layers to eliminate microstructural defects such as porosity and cracks. During FDM printing, the process should be closely monitored, especially during the initial stages and the following simple observations are recommended to ensure geometrically and dimensionally accurate prints:\u2022 When the filament starts loading, remove the molten filament forming around the nozzle to avoid clogging and blockage. This filament is usually under-molten and cannot fuse strongly with the rest of the print material. \u2022 The initial point of printing during the creation of the base support structures (e.g. brim and raster) should be cut off to avoid it being dragged by the nozzle and then destroying the entire support structure. \u2022 Observe the adhesion of the support structure onto the build plate and if the structure appears to delaminate from the plate, stop the printer and repeat the printing process. Additionally, if the printer does not have a heated bed, and the PLA filament does not stick, office glue or other types of glues can be applied onto the printing table to enhance the adhesion and hence, the quality of the prints. \u2022 Observe the critical points of the print (corners, holes, etc.) and check for any incomplete fusion, lack of proper filling and gaps between the layers. These deformities are caused by over-extrusion or under-extrusion of the filament and when this happens, the printer should be stopped, and the settings adjusted.\u2022 The occurrence of stringing or formation of strings/hairs especially when the printer is moving between different sections of the print should also be checked. \u2022 The layering consistency of the print should be checked; slight shifting or separation of the layers is an indication of poor-quality printing. \u2022 The warping of large parts during the FDM processing causes poor sticking of the printed component onto the build plate such that the component shifts on the build plate causing form and dimensional errors.In Chap. 4 of this monograph, some of these quality challenges related to surface quality are illustrated. The challenges can greatly slow the manufacturing process through fused deposition modelling since they imply frequent switching ON and OFF of the printer which prolongs the printing time and results in material loss. It is common knowledge that the longer the manufacturing time, especially in mass production, the higher the cost of production and hence, the process becomes economically unviable."", ""Summary"": ""The basics of fused deposition modelling have been discussed in the chapter. It is no doubt that technology has significantly been accepted in the direct manufacturing of components besides being an attractive rapid prototyping method. It is being utilized to manufacture biomedical devices during the Novel Coronavirus (Covid- 19) pandemic. The quality of the FDM parts depends on the manufacturing process settings. There are several parameters directly influencing the quality of the FDM parts some of which include temperature, speed, infill density, layer height and build orientation. Improper choice of the parameters may lead to adhesion problems between the layers, therefore causing the formation of defects. The major drawback of FDM parts is high surface roughness due to the stair-stepping effect of a 3D printer.The goal of any 3D printer user is to produce high-quality products in terms of form and dimensional accuracy. In the subsequent chapters, the strategies for enhancing the quality of FDM parts based on experiments conducted by the authors and other peer-reviewed and published data will be presented.""}",Basics of Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM),"In this chapter, an overview of the basic principles of fused deposition modelling, commonly known as 3D printing technology, is presented. The chapter begins by introducing the holistic concept of additive manufacturing and its scientific principle as the technology for the modern and future industry. Then, the science of 3D printing is described. The applications of FDM in various fields are also highlighted with a focus on an interesting role the 3D printing technology is playing in the fight against Covid-19 pandemic. The chapter also gives a highlight of the parameters involved in fused deposition modelling of polymers and their basic interaction with the properties of the manufactured components.

In an attempt to control these diseases, the development of chemotherapeutic agents is being actively pursued. The purpose of this coordinated study was to determine the antiviral activity of two pyrimidine compounds, 6-azauridine (AZU) and 5-iododeoxyuridine (IDU), in 10 viral infections of five animal species. Pyrimidines have received a great deal of attention as broad-spectrum antiviral agents in clinical as well as in laboratory studies. Schabel and Montgomery [1] listed 115 pyrimidines that have been tested in vivo. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has established, under the Antiviral Substances Program, a series of experimental viral infections in animals to enable the rapid evaluation of antiviral substances. These experimental models were selected to: (1) include representative agents from a number of major groups of viruses, (2) use a variety of animal species, and (3) simulate potentially treatable viral infections in man. The models used in these studies include Herpesvirus hominis types 1 and 2 and murine cytomegalovirus (CMV) in mice, vaccinia virus and Shope fibroma virus (SFV) in rabbits, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus and swine influenza virus in swine, feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) and feline panleukopenia (FPL) viruses in cats, and ferret distemper virus in ferrets. The program of the Cooperative Antiviral Testing Group, Antiviral Substances Program, is being expanded to include other host-virus models."", ""Materials and Methods"": ""Antiviral compounds. AZU and IDU were supplied to the participants through the Antiviral Substances Program, NIAID, NIH, by Dr. Joseph A. Lubitz of Calbiochem, La Jolla, Calif.Viruses. The swine influenza virus, TGE virus, the MS strain of H. hominis type 2, SFV, FVR virus, ferret distemper virus, and FPL virus have been described previously by Glasgow and Galasso [2] . The S strain of H. hominis type 1, originally isolated from a human facial skin lesion and passaged in HEp-2 cell cultures, was obtained from Dr. Paul E. Came (Schering Corp., Bloomfield, N.J.), propagated in secondary rabbit kidney cell cultures, and assayed in Vero cells. Vaccinia virus was obtained from Eli Lilly and Company (Indianapolis, Ind.) as a lyophilized, commercial smallpox vaccine. The virus was passaged seven times in embryonated chicken eggs and assayed in Vero cells. The murine CMV, Smith strain, was obtained from Dr. June Osborn (University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.), passaged in salivary glands of weanling mice, and assayed in mouse embryo fibroblasts.Description of models. Descriptions of the experimental models are summarized in table 1. Pigs from herds free of swine influenza virus and TGE virus were used in the drug evaluation trials. Swine influenza virus, a type A influenza virus, causes a mild febrile disease after intranasal inoculation in pigs. Weanling pigs six to 10 weeks old (average wt, 10-20 kg) were used in the experiments. Evaluation of treatment was based on duration of viral shedding and fever in the infected animals. The febrile response and presence of virus in nasal secretions are reported as Steffenhagen, Easterday, and Galasso a ratio of number of positive days (febrile or virus) to the total number of days at risk for the treated and control groups. Significance was determined by the X 2 test.The TGE virus, a coronavirus, causes an acute, fatal, enteric disease of the newborn pig. Pigs three to five days old (wt, 2 kg) were inoculated intragastrically, via stomach tube. The pigs were observed twice daily for onset of illness and death. Evaluation of efficacy was based on mean incubation time to onset of diarrhea and vomiting and mean survival time. Significance was determined by analysis of variance.Female New Zealand white rabbits weighing 1-1.5 kg were inoculated with SFV. Experiments were performed with groups of four to six rabbits; weight differences among rabbits did not exceed \u00b1 100 g. Prior to inoculation of virus, the hair on both flanks was removed, and the skin was cleansed with 70% ethyl alcohol. After inoculation the control animals developed localized, erythematous, indurated, tumor lesions on about the fifth day. The lesions attained a maximal size of about 1 em between day 7 and day 9 and thereafter became hemorrhagic and necrotic. Spontaneous and total resolution of the tumors occurred within three weeks.Hairless mice, originally derived from the HRS/Y strain of Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Me.), were randomly bred at the New York University Medical Center animal laboratory facility (New York, New York). Mice weighing 20 -+-2 g were segregated in groups of 10, according to sex and date of birth. The skin overlying the midlumbosacral area was superficially scratched in a criss-cross manner with a 26-gauge hypodermic needle. A cotton swab saturated with a suspension of H. hominis type 1 (S strain) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was rubbed for 10-15 sec on the scarified skin site. The titer of the inoculum was 40-fold that which was found to produce herpetic skin lesions in 50% of the mice. Mice were examined daily for 14 days for lesions and erythema; scoring was performed according to the following criteria: 0 == no lesions; 1 == punctate lesions and erythema; 2 == multiple ulcerations; 3 == coalescent lesions on the lumbosacral area; and 4 == band-like ulceration extending from the middle of the back to the abdomen and often onto the hind legs. The mean lesion In vitro evaluation of AZU. For determination of the sensitivity of the MS strain of H. hominis type 2 to AZU, this strain was compared with two other type 2 strains and two type 1 strains by means of a plaque reduction assay in mouse embryo fibroblasts (table 2). The average plaque count for the type 1 strains was reduced to 50% of the control value by approximately 2.0 ug of AZU/ml, whereas the type 2 strains required about 30 ug/rnl. These limited data suggest that type 1 strains of H. hominis are more Ferret distemper virus, one of the \""medipest\"" viruses, produces a respiratory infection followed by macrophage ingestion and viral seeding of several organs including the central nervous system (CNS ) . An infected ferret that had been given an ip inoculation seven days earlier was placed with the test animals. This procedure proved to be a reliable and reproducible means of natural infection. Mean survival time was the parameter measured for drug evaluation.Evaluation of toxicity. Drug control groups were included for observation of toxic reactions. Parameters used to denote toxicity were: (1 ) deaths or clinical appearance of intoxication in the drug control groups, (2) enhancement of the disease process in treated infected animals, (3) suppression of the immune response and/or prolongation of the course of the disease, and (4) development of fever (swine model only). Signs of toxicity from AZU in vitro were evidenced by detachment of cells from the culture vessel."", ""Type 1 Shealey Tyler"": ""Type 2 Curtis Lovelace MS score was determined daily, and the average lesion score was calculated at the end of the observation period from the maximal score attained by the individual mice in each group, irrespective of the day on which it was recorded. Disseminated H. hominis type 2 infections were produced in suckling mice (three to seven days of age) from CD-l dams (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass. ) by allowing each mouse to inhale six drops (approximately 0.01 ml) of H. hominis type 2 from a 26-gauge needle. Each animal received 1,000 pfu of H. hominis type 2 (8 LD 5 o) ; this dose resulted in a mortality rate of 90%-100%. Infected animals developed an illness characterized by lethargy and decreased spontaneous movement. On days 3-4 of infection, they had difficulty righting themselves if turned over and often developed rapid, repetitive movements of the extremities if stimulated. Paralysis and death usually occurred by day 5. Infection in the newborn mouse with H. hominis type 2 has been previously described and appears to simulate closely neonatal herpesvirus infections in newborn human infants [3] [4] [5] .Mice five to seven days of age were given ip inoculations of murine CMV in a dose that would result in a mortality rate of 80%-90%. Murine CMV replicates in lung, liver, spleen, and kidney within 24 hr after infection. A viremia is detectable at 24-48 hr, and seeding of brain tissue occurs by 72 hr. Most of the animals die eight to 10 days after viral inoculation.FVR virus, a member of the herpesvirus group, produced a severe upper respiratory disease in cats. Fever and nasal and ocular exudates were measured daily and graded on a scale of 1-4, and sneezing was graded daily.Cats were collected from farms and used for experiments immediately. The challenge virus was administered in an aerosolization chamber with a no. 40 DeVilbiss atomizer (DeVilbiss Co., Somerset, Pa.) with an air pressure of 5 lb/square inch. The cats were exposed to a single 5-sec burst of spray source material containing 104.1'1-10 5 TCID 5 0 of virus/rnl. FPL virus, a parvovirus, can cause a severe intestinal infection accompanied by leukopenia. Cats were infected orally with 1.0 m1 containing l0 3 TCID50, a dose that is not lethal. Evaluation of antiviral compounds was based on the effect sensitive to the action of AZU in tissue culture than are type 2 strains.In vivo evaluation of AZU. Swine influenza virus and TGE virus infection of swine. Weanling pigs were infected with 2 X 10 5 . 5 50% egg infectious doses (E1050) of swine influenza virus as a 10% suspension of infected pig lung. AZU was given ip in sterile saline in a dose of 150 mg/ kg per day. Sterile saline served as placebo. When treatment was initiated three days before viral challenge, there was a significant increase in the period of viral shedding (P < 0.01) and a reduction in number of days of fever (P < 0.01), as determined by the X 2 test (table 3) . No positive effects were observed when treatment was initiated one day before viral challenge. AZU, therefore, was not effective in this model. No evidence of toxicity was observed in any of the animals.Baby pigs were inoculated with 1,000 pig infectious units of TOE virus as a 10% suspension of infected gut and treated ip daily with 150 mg of AZU/kg. The control pigs received sterile saline ip as placebo. In each of four trials, the mean survival time was not significantly increased.An evaluation of AZU toxicity was conducted in weanling pigs weighing 11-13 kg. Each animal received 150 mg of AZU/kg ip daily for nine days, and a group of control pigs weighing 9-14 kg received placebo; no evidence of toxicity was seen.SFV infection of rabbits. Rabbits were given intradermal (id) inoculations of SFV in 0.1 ml of medium containing 10 3 TC1050, and the lesions were scored on a scale of 1 (slight erythema) to 4 (severe erythema and induration). Control animals consistently developed type 4 lesions. Therefore, lowered scores of 1 or 2 in the treated groups were considered to be due to effects of treatment. AZU was administered daily in doses of 100 or 200 mg/kg. Treatment was initiated either on the day of infection or 24 hr after infection and was continued for five consecutive days. AZU in the dosages used did not protect rabbits from developing SFV-induced lesions.H. hominis type 1 infection of hairless mice. After cutaneous inoculation of mice with 4 X 10 5 pfu of H. hominis type 1, skin lesions appeared between day 3 and day 4 as small punctate lesions that rapidly ulcerated, enlarged, and coalesced within two to three more days to form a unilateral, linear, ulcerative, zosteriform lesion extending from the spinal regions towards the abdomen and hind limb of the infected animal. The \""bleached\"" zone of skin, which has been reported by Lieberman et al. [6] , was observed to precede the appearance of lesions. There was CNS disturbance in most animals, with paralysis and death occurring eight to 10 days after infection. A few animals that developed cutaneous infection but had no CNS involvement showed complete healing of the skin lesions within three to four weeks. In very rare instances mice that developed CNS disease survived with some residual paralysis. The significance of the differences t NS =not significant. \u00a7 5-Iododeoxyuridine was given ip in a dose of 100 mg/kg daily for 10 days beginning two days before viral challenge. The drug-related mortality rate was 100%. in survival rate, number of animals that developed severe lesions, and incidence of paralysis was evaluated by Fisher's exact test. The differences in mean survival time and average lesion score were evaluated by Student's t-test. Mice were treated daily with 250 mg of AZU/kg for up to 10 days after inoculation. No protective effect was demonstrable. The mean survival time was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) in treated infected animals as compared with the value in untreated infected control animals, although no overt signs of toxicity were observed.H. hominis type 2 and murine CMV infection of newborn mice. The effect of AZU on the mortality rate of mice infected with H. hominis type 2 was determined. Treatment was initiated 1-2 hr after intranasal inoculation of 1,000 pfu (8 LDso) of virus, and the drug was administered ip once daily for a period of five days. The effectiveness of this compound was determined for concentrations of 125, 62.5, and 31.3 mg/kg (table 4). No reduction in mortality rate was observed with any of the treatment regimens used. The untreated infected control group had a final mortality rate of 70%, and mice treated with 62.5 or 31.3 mg of AZU/kg had a final mortality rate of 85%. Concentrations of >62.5 mg of the drug/kg had lethal toxicity for the animals. There was no increase observed in the mean survival time of the treated animals.Five-to seven-day-old suckling mice were given ip inoculations of murine CMV in a concentration known to kill approximately 80% of the animals and were treated ip daily for six days with 100, 50, or 25 mg of AZU/kg. Treatment of animals Mice were treated ip once daily for five days. with maximally tolerated doses of AZU did not alter the final mortality rate of murine CMVinfected newborn mice, nor did it increase the mean survival time (table 5) ."", ""FVR virus and FPL virus infections in cats and ferret distemper virus infection in ferrets. FVR"": ""virus-infected cats were given 10 mg of AZU/kg intranasally for 10 days after infection. Parameters measured daily for 18 days after infection indicated no differences between means for control and treated groups (control values are given first) in: fever, 101.5 F vs. 101.2 F; nasal exudate, 0.42 vs. 0.17; and ocular exudate, 0.35 vs. 0.29. The difference between the value for sneezing in controls (34.6%) and that in treated animals ( 12%) was significant. Intraperitoneal administration of 100 mg/kg was lethal to all cats receiving this dose. AZU given to FPL virusinfected cats at a dose of 100 mg/kg daily for five days had no effect on the transitory leukopenia of the treated groups as compared with results in controls. Ferrets given 100 mg of AZU/ kg ip daily for eight days after infection with ferret distemper virus survived for a mean of 11.0 days, a period that was 0.8 days longer than that in controls. AZU was therefore not considered to be effective in these models.In vitro evaluation of IDU. The sensitivity of H. hominis types 1 and 2 to IDU in tissue culture has been reported previously [5] . In both human and mouse cells, 0.5-1.0 flg of IOU/ml reduced the number of plaques of type 2 strains by 50%, and type 1 strains were about twofold more sensitive than the type 2 strains. The sensitivity of murine CMV to IOU was determined by 8 means of a plaque reduction assay in mouse embryo fibroblast cells. The 50% inhibitory concentration of IOU was approximately 0.4 ug/ml."", ""In vivo evaluation of IDU. Swine influenza virus and TGE virus infection of swine."": ""In the swine influenza model, IOU was administered ip at a dose of 100 mg/kg daily for up to 10 days. Control animals received a sterile saline placebo. Viral challenge was administered on the third day of treatment. There was only a tendency (P < 0.10) for an increase in number of days of fever; however, a significant (P < 0.005) decrease in period of viral shedding was observed in the treated group as compared with the value in the control group (table 3) . Although IOU was effective in decreasing viral shedding, it was toxic at the level used, causing a mortality rate of 100% in the treated animals. IOU was ineffective in the TGE virus model as judged by mean incubation time and/or mean survival time. Controls lived longer than treated animals in each case, but the difference was significant (P < 0.01) in only one experiment. The drug therefore may have enhanced the disease process.Toxicity of IOU' in pigs was shown in both weanling and baby pigs. Among uninfected baby pigs, the treated group received 100 mg of IOU / kg intragastrically for four to nine days; these animals developed diarrhea with a mean incubation time of 2.7 days. The mortality rate was 100 %, and the animals survived for a mean of 609 5.8 days. The control group, which received 0.4% carboxymethylcellulose intragastrically, was asymptomatic. IOU was given ip to uninfected weanling pigs at doses of 50 and 25 mg/kg daily for nine days. In two treated groups, the number of febrile days was increased (P < 0.005); the mortality rates in these two groups were 67 % and 100%. Control groups received sterile saline ip with no resulting deaths.SFV and vaccinia virus infection of rabbits. In rabbits given id inoculations of 0.1 ml of SFV (10 3 TCID50), ip treatment with 100 mg of IOU/ kg daily beginning on the day of infection and continuing for six days proved ineffective. A dose of 200 rug/kg for six days had a slight effect, but this dose was toxic as shown by a 50% mortality rate among the treated rabbits. In rabbits infected with vaccinia virus, treatment with IOU did not result in any protective effect when the drug was administered topically as a 5% solution twice daily for four days after inoculation.H. hominis type 1 infection of hairless mice. Hairless mice given superficial inoculations of H. hominis type 1 received 100 mg of IOU/kg ip daily for 12 days beginning at the time of viral inoculation. This compound significantly (P < 0.001) reduced the severity of the virus-induced lesions and increased the survival rate of the mice (P < 0.01) (table 6). When treatment was started one day after infection, an even lower average lesion score was observed and faster heal- NOTE. Mice were infected with H. hominis type 1 by rubbing into the scarified skin of a suspension of the Schering strain of the virus (Schering Corp., Bloomfield, N.J.) containing 4 X 10 5 pfu/rnl. Treated mice were given daily ip injections of IOU (100 mgy'kg) as an aqueous suspension containing 2 mg of IDU/0.25 ml of phosphate-buffered saline.* The difference between these values and those in controls was statistically significant (P < 0.001) by Student's ttest.t The difference between these values and those in controls was statistically significant (P < 0.001) by Fisher's exact test.t The difference between these values and those in controls was statistically significant (P < 0.01) by Fisher's exact test. \u00a7 These values were not found to be significantly different from those in controls (P > 0.5).NOTE.

The course of infection was not altered when treatment was begun on the third day after infection, at the time when the \""earliest lesions usually became evident. The consistent observation of a better antiviral effect when treatment with IDU was delayed for 24 hr after infection might be explained either by the toxicity of the compound or by the stress produced by the physical handling of the animals and the concomitant effect on the spread of the infection.H. hominis type 2 and murine CMV infection of newborn mice. The effect of IDU on newborn mice given intranasal inoculations of H. hominis type 2 has been reported previously [5] . Treatment with IDU had no effect on final mortality rate or mean survival time but did significantly alter the pathogenesis of infection. Replication of H. hominis in the lung was reduced, and viremia as well as subsequent involvement of the liver and spleen was completely inhibited. However, transmission to the CNS and replication of H. hominis in that target organ were not affected by treatment with IDU. Treatment of newborn mice infected with murine CMV with 25 mg of IDU/kg twice daily for eight days had no effect on final mortality rate or mean survival time (table 7) . With the exception of a reduction in viral replication in the spleen, no effect of treatment on pathogenesis of the virus was observed. IDU administered ip to ferrets in a dose of 50 mg/kg daily for four days after infection had no effect on the mean survival time as compared with the value in the control group."", ""FVR virus infection in cats and ferret distemper virus infection in ferrets."": ""IDU toxicity experiments in cats given 100 mg /kg ip daily for four days revealed several adverse effects. The clinical signs were vomiting, depression, and concomitant loss of appetite. Similar effects were seen in cats given 50 mg/kg, In ferrets, the dose of 100 mg of IDU/kg produced a slight depression and loss of appetite."", ""Discussion"": ""The efficacy of IDU or AZU could not be demonstrated by these studies, with the exception of IDU treatment of hairless mice infected with H. hominis type 1 (table 8 ). In this model infection, the severity of disease was significantly reduced (P < 0.001) and the survival time was increased (P < 0.01) when treatment was initiated at the time of inoculation and continued for 12 days. Earlier investigations [5, 7, 8] did not find IDU to be as effective when virus was administered by other routes. In animals given intranasal inoculations, viremia was eliminated, but spread to the CNS with subsequent death was not altered, probably because of inadequate levels of IDU in the CNS. More recently, a cooperative clinical trial of IDU [9] also failed to demonstrate efficacy in man and was terminated because of toxicity. IDU in vitro inhibited 50% of a standard inoculum of murine CMV at a concentration of 0.20-0.78 ug of IDU/ml. There was no difference between IDU-treated and untreated animals among suckling mice infected with murine CMV, cats infected with FVR virus, or ferrets infected with ferret distemper virus. Pigs treated with IDU were significantly protected (P < 0.005) against swine influenza virus; however, toxicity precludes utilization of this drug.AZU yielded only a minimal degree of efficacy NOTE. 6-Azauridine inhibits the synthesis of RNA, and 5-iododeoxyuridine inhibits the synthesis of DNA.

The number of days of fever was reduced in the swine influenza model, whereas the duration of viral shedding was increased. There was no evidence of toxicity of this compound in pigs at the dosage levels tested.The apparent enhancement of the severity of H. hominis type 1 infection in hairless mice with AZU treatment was characterized by a decrease in the mean survival time of the treated mice as compared with the value in untreated controls. This potentiation of H. hominis type 1 infection may be related to the immunosuppressive action of this compound rather than to toxicity per se, although drug-related toxicity was observed in suckling mice.AZU has also been evaluated against rabies virus infection both in vitro and in vivo. Although this compound effectively interferes with the replication of a tissue culture-adapted strain of rabies virus, it does not protect mice challenged with street rabies virus [10] .Coordination of studies from five laboratories has resulted in a rapid screening evaluation of two potential antiviral chemotherapeutic agents. Application of these drugs in 10 viral diseases in five animal species in models that simulate diseases of man has provided a broad evaluation of efficacy in vivo against both DNA and RNA viruses. In the development of these models, great care was taken to limit the infective viral challenge to provide a host that was not overwhelmed and to allow any antiviral effect of the compound being tested to be detected.The RNA inhibitor AZU was tested in infections with DNA viruses as well as in infections with RNA viruses; the DNA inhibitor IDU was also tested in infections with both types of virus to provide a negative check for efficacy in vivo. By testing both compounds against a range of challenge viruses, a clearer profile of the in vivo efficacy and toxicity of each compound was achieved. Pharmacological evaluation of the two agents and thorough studies of their effect on the pathogenesis of the diseases were beyond the scope of this study. Although the studies reported here do not preclude effectiveness of these two agents in other viral infections of humans or experimental animals, they provide minimal support for more extensive evaluations of IDU and AZU efficacy in human trials. It is of interest to note that two placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies initiated to evaluate the effectiveness of IDU in treatment of H. hominis encephalitis were terminated because of the severe toxicity associated with the use of this drug [8] .""}",Evaluation of 6-Azauridine and S-Iododeoxyuridine in the Treatment of Experimental Viral Infections,"The potential antiviral activity of 6-azauridine and 5-iododeoxyuridine was evaluated in a coordinated study at five institutions. Experimental models in five species, the mouse, rabbit, swine, cat, and ferret, were established with use of 10 viruses: Herpesvirus hominis types 1 and 2, murine cytomegalovirus, vaccinia virus, Shope fibroma virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, swine influenza virus, feline viral rhinotracheitis virus, feline panleukopenia virus, and ferret distemper virus. Criteria for selection were: (1) representation from a number of major groups of viruses, (2) reproduction of natural routes of infection, and (3) simulation of potentially treatable viral infections of man. Antiviral activity was observed for 5-iododeoxyuridine in H. hominis infections in hairless mice and influenza in swine, and a slight degree of efficacy was noted in rabbits infected with Shope fibroma virus. Toxicity was also observed in most of the experimental models. There was a suggestion of antiviral activity with 6-azauridine in swine infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus; however, enhancement of disease and some toxicity were seen in most of the other models. Efficacy of these two compounds was not well substantiated by these studies.",10.1093/infdis/133.6.603,PMC,PMC7109945,180189.0,no-cc,1976-06-22,J Infect Dis,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109945/,1976.0,paper

Decision processes, electrical switching networks, or intra-cellular molecular networks represent examples. There is a long tradition in the engineering literature of work related to an understanding of how the structure of such models constrains their dynamics, see, e.g., [3, 2] . This problem is important both for the design of networks as well as for their analysis. In both theoretical and applied studies of dynamical systems, the problem of predicting dynamic features of the system from structural properties is very important, see, e.g., [7, 9] . An instantiation of this problem is the question in systems biology whether the connectivity structure of molecular networks, such as metabolic or gene regulatory networks, has special features that correlate with the type of dynamics these 1 networks exhibit. (This type of application motivated the present study.) Some progress has been made on this question. For instance, in [1] it was shown that certain small network motifs appear much more often in such networks than would be expected in a random graph. The work in this paper was motivated by the desire to provide a theoretical framework within which the relationship between structure and dynamics of certain families of dynamical systems can be studied. We briefly describe this framework and show one example of a result and its implications.The type of dynamical system studied here is discrete in time as well as in variable states. That is, we consider a collection x 1 , . . . , x n of variables, each of which can take on values in a finite set X. We consider time-discrete dynamical systems f : X n \u2212\u2192 X n .A well-known instantiation of such systems are Boolean networks, which have many applications in molecular biology as well as engineering. In this case, X = {0, 1}. As described, such systems are set functions without additional mathematical structure. It is therefore advantageous to impose additional mathematical structure on X, namely that of a finite field. This is of course utilized in the case of Boolean networks. Evaluation of Boolean functions is equivalent to carrying out arithmetic in the Boolean field with two elements. The translation between Boolean functions and polynomials is straightforward, with the Boolean operator AND corresponding to multiplication, addition corresponding to XOR, and negation corresponding to addition of 1. Once we have a finite field structure on X, which we shall now denote by K, it is well-known that any function K n \u2212\u2192 K can be represented as a polynomial function [8, p. 369 ]. Thus, we can focus on systemsfor which each f i is a polynomial function in the variables x 1 , . . . , x n . We will call such a system a polynomial dynamical system (PDS) over K. A powerful consequence is that one can use algorithms and theoretical results from computer algebra and computational algebraic geometry, such as the theory of Gr\u00f6bner bases.It has been shown [10, 5] that discrete models in several different frameworks can be translated into the PDS framework, namely k-bounded Petri nets, so-called logical models used in molecular biology, and many agent-based models, which are becoming very prominent in biology. Thus, the framework of PDS provides provides a common theoretical formulation. Using algorithms from polynomial algebra, the software package ADAM (Analysis of Dynamic Algebraic Models) [6] is very efficient in analyzing various features of PDS, including their dynamics. Thus, any theoretical results about PDS apply to all these model types.In this paper, we are concerned with the family P of all PDS of a given dimension n over a finite field K. The structural information for a PDS includes a directed graph that indicates the dependency relationships between variables. In the context of a molecular network model, this graph would represent the wiring diagram of the network. Graphs can be represented by their adjacency matrices. The set of n \u00d7 n matrices carries an algebraic structure using max and min operations, which has been studied previously over the real field, see, e.g., [4] . Here we prove a result about the relationship between properties of dynamical systems in P under composition and properties of the corresponding adjacency matrices in the max-min algebra. As a consequence of this result, we derive a dynamic property of PDS with acyclic dependency graphs. Finally, we give an application of this consequence to a published model of in vitro virus competition."", ""The algebra of dynamical systems"": ""Let K be any finite field. We consider dynamical systemswhere f i : K n \u2192 K for i = 1, . . . , n. As observed above, any such f is a PDS. Let P denote the family of all such systems. It is well-known that P has the structure of an associative algebra under coordinate-wise addition and composition of functions.To f we can associate a directed graph with the n nodes x 1 , . . . , x n . There is a directed edge from x j to x i if x j appears in f i . Let [f ] be the n \u00d7 n adjacency matrix of this graph. That is, [f ] = (a ij ) is defined as follows:The adjacency matrix has binary entries, and we now define two operations on such matrices. Let B denote the Boolean field with two elements, with the natural order 0 < 1.matrices with entries in B, we define the following operation:Forming the adjacency matrix of the dependency graph of a PDS then gives a mapping P \u2212\u2192 M.And we also have a mapping that associates to an element in P its phase space, a directed graph on the vertex set |K n |, which encodes the dynamics of the system. We will denote by S the set of all directed graphs on |K n | with the property that each vertex has a unique outgoing edge (the requirement for being the phase space of a deterministic PDS). Hence, we have mappingsThe result in the next section relates information in M to information in S.in M for all f, g \u2208 P.Proof. Let A, B, and C be the adjacency matrices for f , g, and f \u2022 g, respectively. It suffices to prove that, if c ij = 1, then a ik b kj = 1 for some k. Let us assume that c ij = 1, then there arewhere y s = g s (x (j,p) ) and\u0177 s = g s (x (j,q) ) for s = 1, . . . , n. Then there is an index k such that f i depends on x k andTherefore, a ik = 1 and b kj = 1 and, consequently, a ik b kj = 1.[f ] r for all f \u2208 P, and for any r \u2265 1."", ""Proof."": ""Replace g by f in Theorem 3.1."", ""PDS with acyclic dependency graph"": ""As an easy application of our main result we now consider PDS in P that have an acyclic dependency graph, that is, no feedback loops in their structure. For any f : K n \u2192 K n with acyclic dependency graph we can see easily that its adjacency matrix [f ] is a strictly triangular matrix,i.e., with zeros in the diagonal (otherwise, there would be loops in the graph). Therefore, its characteristic polynomial is equal to \u03bb r , where r is the order of the matrix. So [f ] is nilpotent and [f ] r = 0. "", ""Application"": ""In this section we will present an application of Corollary 4.1 to a published model of an in vitro competition between two strains of a murine coronavirus studied in Jarrah et. al. [11] . The model is presented as a hexagonal grid of cells, with color coding of cells to indicate their infection status. Normal cells are represented as white. Infected cells are represented as red or green, or yellow, in the case of dual infection. The infection spreads from the center outwards. At each time step one ring of new cells is infected. The outcome of a cell in the new ring depends on the infection status of its two neighbors in the previous infected ring. The local update function for each cell is constructed using the following rules:\u2022 If a cell has only one infected neighbor, it will get the same type of infection.\u2022 If a cell has two infected neighbors, then we use the following The dynamics of this system is represented in Figure 1 . In this example we will use 169 cells. In order to simulate experimental conditions described in [11] we initialize the infection using the 37 center cells. Each cell can have only one of four colors at a time. We use the field with four elements, F 4 = {0, 1, 2, 3}, to represent the set of different colors. The color assignment is as follows. Green  0  Red  1  White  2  Yellow  3 We represent the 169 cells by the variables x 1 , . . . , x 169 , with x 1 , . . . , x 37 representing the center cells. The variables x 128 , . . . , x 169 represents the cells in the outermost ring."", ""Color assignment Color Field element"": ""In [11] the system was studied from the point of view of the experimental system. There, a collection of cells was infected in the center of the dish, and the infection was then observed to spread to the rest of the Petri dish in a pattern that showed distinct segmentation, matching the experimental results. In order to mimic the biological system, it was assumed that the cells initially infected did not change their infection state Figure 1 : Dynamics of the constrained model subsequently, so that the model is constrained and heterogeneous with respect to the rules assigned to all the nodes. This, in effect, changes the dynamical system since those cells are now assigned constant functions rather than the rules described above. The outcome is a steady state that shows a characteristic segmentation which coincides with experimental observations. See Figure 1 for an example.If, however, we allow all cells to evolve according to the update rule above, then the outcome is significantly different. In that case, the center cell plays a very special role. It is represented by the only node in the network that does not receive any inputs from other cells and is therefore constant. (Note that, in order to have an acyclic dependency graph, a PDS must have at least one node without incoming edges.) The state of that node then plays the role of an external parameter, and a particular choice of state/color for this node is part of the system description. In this We conclude that in this case any initialization of the system, that is, any assignment of colors to each of the nodes in the network, results in a unique steady state, namely the state in which all nodes have the same color as the center node.In effect, what happens is that after initializing the 37 nodes in the center they propagate a distinct, segmentation-like pattern. At the same time, the color in the center cell propagates outward and overpowers the segmentation pattern, resulting in a system state with a homogenous color distribution. See Figure 3 .If we now assume that a larger number of cells in the center is infected, that is, is assigned a color that does not change subsequently, as in the initial experiments, then the color distribution along the edge of the infected region propagates and produces a steady state that show the segmentation patterns observed in [11] . Written as a polynomial, f i has the following formThis polynomial form can then be used to compute the steady state configuration by solving a system of polynomial equations. 6 ODEs with acyclic dependency graphAs an aside note we will mention that our main result is also valid for dynamical systems with differential equations. We now consider ODEs that have an acyclic dependency graph, that is, no feedback loops in their structure. For any ODE with acyclic dependency graph we can see easily that its adjacency matrix [f ] is a strictly triangular matrix, i.e., with zeros in the diagonal (otherwise, there would be loops in the graph).Theorem 6.1. Consider an ODE with acyclic dependency graph, then there is a unique steady state and it is asymptotically stable.To proof this we need the following lemma. The last expression converges to 0 as t \u2192 \u221e and this finishes the proof.Proof. It is enough to consider z(t) = f (x(t)) and apply the lemma above.When modeling biological systems using ODEs, it is common for the functions to have natural decay; that is, they are of the form x i = f (x) \u2212 k i x i for i = 1, . . . , n. The dependency graph of such an ODE is the graph with nodes {1, . . . , n} and an edge from i to j if f j depends on x i . Proof of theorem 6.1. Consider an ODE with natural decay. Without loss of generality, we consider that the adjacency matrix of the dependency graph is of the formFor i = 2 we have x 2 = f 2 (x 1 ) \u2212 k 2 x 2 ; then, by the corollary, we have that lim t\u2192\u221e x 2 (t) = s 2 , where s 2 = f 2 (s 1 ) k 2 .8 By induction, if lim t\u2192\u221e (x 1 (t), . . . , x i\u22121 (t)) = (s 1 , . . . , s i\u22121 ) and. At the end, we have s = (s 1 , . . . , s n ) \u2208 R n such that lim t\u2192\u221e x(t) = s (regardless of the value of x(0)). It follows that s is the unique steady state and that it is asymptotically stable."", ""Discussion"": ""In this paper we have shown that it is fruitful to study the relationship between the structure and the dynamics of discrete dynamical systems by looking at the algebraic properties of the mapping P \u2212\u2192 M from the algebra of PDS to the algebra of adjacency matrices. With a very straightforward proof we have shown that dynamics is very simple in the absence of feedback loops. It is worth observing that this result, Corollary 4.1, could also have been obtained as a consequence of a more general result that says that for the existence of more than one fixed point, a positive feedback loop is required in the dependency graph, and for periodic orbits to exist a negative feedback is necessary (but not sufficient). This result implies that in order to obtain more than one fixed point or periodic orbits, it is necessary that the dependency graph of the system have feedback loops [9] . However, the proof we have given here of this same result is very simple and stems from a basic property of the mapping P \u2212\u2192 M rather than complicated phase space arguments. It emphasizes our belief that the proper framework for studying the relationship between structure and dynamics of PDS is the algebra inherent in this mapping.Furthermore, we have shown that one can use Corollary 4.1 to draw non-obvious conclusions about a system of interest. This conclusion would be very difficult to arrive at through simulations, due to the combinatorial complexity of the dynamics on a large grid.""}",Structure and Dynamics of Polynomial Dynamical Systems,"Discrete models have a long tradition in engineering, including finite state machines, Boolean networks, Petri nets, and agent-based models. Of particular importance is the question of how the model structure constrains its dynamics. This paper discusses an algebraic framework to study such questions. The systems discussed here are given by mappings on an affine space over a finite field, whose coordinate functions are polynomials. They form a general class of models which can represent many discrete model types. Assigning to such a system its dependency graph, that is, the directed graph that indicates the variable dependencies, provides a mapping from systems to graphs. A basic property of this mapping is derived and used to prove that dynamical systems with an acyclic dependency graph can only have a unique fixed point in their phase space and no periodic orbits. This result is then applied to a published model of in vitro virus competition.",,ArXiv,,,arxiv,2011-07-31,,,,1108.0209,18603944.0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.0209v1.pdf,2011.0,paper

There were no differences between groups in physiologic data other than arterial carbon dioxide. In rabbits receiving sevoflurane, mean arterial pressure decreased presurgical intervention, heart rate increased 25% during and after surgery and body weight decreased 4% post-operatively. Post-operative problems sometimes resulted from catheterization of the ear artery.Conclusion Sevoflurane and sufentanil-midazolam provided surgical anaesthesia of similar quality. Arterial blood pressure was sustained during sufentanil-midazolam anaesthesia and rabbits receiving sevoflurane lost body weight following ovariohysterectomy. Mechanical ventilation was required with both anaesthetic regimens.Clinical relevance Anaesthesia with sufentanilmidazolam in medetomidine premedicated healthy rabbits is useful in the clinical and the research setting, as an alternative to sevoflurane.There were no differences between groups in body weight before surgery (SUF-MID: 2.1 AE 0.1 kg, SEVO: 2.2 AE 0.1 kg) and none of the rabbits showed any clinical signs of disease.

The duration of surgery and the total duration of anaesthesia did not differ (SUF-MID: 63 AE 16 and 103 AE 15 minutes, SEVO: 55 AE 11 minutes and 112 AE 13 minutes, respectively).In group SUF-MID, the mean infusion dose was 1.6 lg kg \u00c01 hour \u00c01 sufentanil and 0.3 mg kg \u00c01 hour \u00c01 midazolam during PREP and 3.9 lg kg \u00c01 hour \u00c01 and 0.8 mg kg \u00c01 hour \u00c01 , respectively, during SUR.

Four SEVO rabbits required mechanical ventilation for 20-50 minutes, one during PREP only and three during SUR.There were no differences between groups in HR or MAP. In group SUF-MID, HR was higher POST Table 1 Heart rate (HR), arterial blood pressure (MAP), arterial blood gases, blood glucose and lactate levels (mean AE SD) in Himalayan rabbits undergoing ovariohysterectomy during sufentanil-midazolam (SUF-MID) or sevoflurane (SEVO) anaesthesia compared with SED values, whereas in group SEVO, HR was higher both during SUR and POST, compared with SED values (Table 1 ). In group SUF-MID, MAP did not change between sedation, preparation and surgery whereas in group SEVO, MAP was lower during preparation, compared with SED values (p = 0.05, power = 0.9, Table 1 , Fig. 1) . It was only possible to get a consistent reading from the pulse oximeter in five animals in group SUF-MID and three animals in group SEVO. In these animals, SpO 2 ranged between 86 and 100%. Arterial blood samples were obtained from all but one animal in group SUF-MID and mean PaO 2 did not differ between groups. It was higher during PREP and SUR compared to SED in group SEVO (Table 1) . PaCO 2 was higher in group SUF-MID than in group SEVO during PREP, and higher in group SEVO during PREP and SUR compared with SED (Table 1) .Glucose levels did not differ between groups but were lower POST compared to SED in group SEVO. Lactate levels were lower in group SEVO than SUF-MID during SUR and POST (Table 1) .Rectal temperature was lower in group SUF-MID during SUR and POST compared to SED (37.3 AE 0.8\u00b0C and 37.5 AE 0.7\u00b0C versus 38.4 AE 0.6\u00b0C). In group SEVO, RT was lower only during POST compared to SED (37.6 AE 0.6 versus 38.5 AE 0.6\u00b0C).

Time to recovery of the righting reflex was longer in group SUF-MID (62 AE 32 minutes) than in group SEVO (27 AE 22 minutes).

One rabbit in group SEVO received 0.25 mg kg \u00c01 atipamezole (Antisedan vet, 5 mg mL 1 , Orion Pharma Animal Health, Sweden) intramuscularly due to marked sedation 90 minutes after end of surgery.Body weight was stable in group SUF-MID whereas it decreased 4% during post-operative day 1-4 in group SEVO (p = 0.05, power = 1.0, Fig. 2) . However, there were no differences of body weight between the groups."", ""Introduction"": ""The rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculi) is the third most common pet animal species undergoing anaesthesia in the United Kingdom (Brodbelt et al. 2008 ) and the third most commonly used laboratory animal species in Europe (European commission 2010). A surgical intervention routinely performed in female rabbits and which requires general anaesthesia is ovariohysterectomy. For largely unknown reasons, anaesthesia of rabbits carries a high mortality risk in comparison with dogs and cats (Brodbelt 2009 ). Possible anaesthetic risk factors in rabbits include; a high stress level, high prevalence of clinical and subclinical disease, small body size and relatively small lungs. Moreover, rabbits are not routinely endotracheally intubated and possibly are less carefully monitored during anaesthesia compared with cats and dogs (Brodbelt 2006) . In addition, anaesthesia in rabbits has been studied less than in the aforementioned species.Anaesthesia can be achieved with inhalation or injection of anaesthetic drugs. Some benefits of using inhalation anaesthesia are that most veterinarians are familiar with the technique and that anaesthetic depth can be precisely controlled. Sevoflurane (SEVO) has a lower blood: gas partition coefficient (0.7) than isoflurane (1.4), resulting in more rapid induction and recovery and possibly a greater ability to control anaesthetic depth. Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) has the benefit of separating provision of anaesthesia from ventilation and reducing atmospheric pollution. If rapidly metabolized drugs which action can be antagonized are administered by target control infusion, adjustment of anaesthetic depth and time to recovery is rapid. High dose opioid anaesthesia provides cardiovascular stability in humans as well as in dogs (Bovill et al. 1984; Benson et al. 1987; Flecknell et al. 1989) . In human cardiac surgery, sufentanilbased protocols have been shown to be superior to fentanyl in respect of cardiac output and haemodynamic stability during and after anaesthesia (Howie et al. 1991; Sato et al. 1995) . In combination with midazolam, sufentanil has been shown to produce safe surgical anaesthesia in cardiovascularly compromised dogs suffering from gastric dilatation/volvulus (Hellebrekers & Sap 1991) and doses have been established in New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits premedicated with medetomidine (Hedenqvist et al. 2013; Larsson et al. 2014) . Similarly to opioids, alpha-2-adrenergic agonists have been shown to reduce the surgical stress response in humans and dogs, which may prevent cardiac complications (Wijeysundera et al. 2009 ). Our aim was to compare sufentanil-midazolam (SUF-MID) anaesthesia with SEVO anaesthesia in medetomidine premedicated Himalayan rabbits regarding cardio-respiratory variables, lactate, glucose and recovery after surgery. Our hypothesis was that SUF-MID would have less effect on cardiovascular and metabolic variables than would SEVO."", ""Materials and methods"": ""The study was granted permission from the regional ethics committee of animal experiments in Uppsala (C 83/12) and met the requirements of Swedish and EU legislation regarding the use of experimental animals."", ""Animals"": ""Eighteen female Himalayan rabbits, with an age of 15 weeks and a mean AE SD body weight of 2.1 AE 0.1 kg were acquired from a certified breeder (Crl:CHBB[HM], Kissleg, Germany). According to standard health monitoring (Nicklas et al. 2002) , the breeding colony was free from known rabbit pathogenic and opportunistic agents (rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus, rabbit rotavirus/rabbit corona virus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Clostridium piliforme, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella spp, endo-and ectoparasites, dermatophytes). The rabbits were housed in pairs in double cage systems (EC2, Scanbur Technology A/S, Denmark), with a total floor area of 0.86 m 2 and a combined hiding place/shelf. Autoclaved straw was used as bedding and the cages were cleaned once a week. Autoclaved hay and water ad lib, and a limited ration of pelleted feed (SDS Standard Rabbit, Special Diet Services, UK) was provided daily. The rabbits were acclimatised for two weeks, and during five days prior to surgery they were accustomed to handling by daily weighing.

Approximately 30 minutes before anaesthetic induction, the animals were premedicated with 0.1 mg kg \u00c01 medetomidine (Domitor vet, Orion Pharma Animal Health, Sweden) and 5 mg kg \u00c01 carprofen (Rimadyl vet, Orion Pharma Animal Health, Sweden) subcutaneously (SC). The fur on the ears was clipped and a local anaesthetic cream (EMLA, AstraZeneca, Sweden) was applied to the skin. Before preparations for anaesthetic induction started, respiratory rate (f R ) and heart rate (HR) were recorded manually. Preparations included placement of catheters (BD Neoflon, 24 gauge, BD Medical Surgical Systems, Sweden) in the central auricular artery and the marginal auricular vein. The fur of the tail was clipped for placement of a pulse oximeter finger clip sensor (Datex-Ohmeda GE Health Care, Sweden)."", ""Induction of anaesthesia"": ""Anaesthesia was induced in the same way in all rabbits, by intravenous (IV) infusion with a mixture of sufentanil (Sufenta, 50 lg mL \u00c01 , Jansen-Cilag, Sweden) and midazolam (Midazolam, 1 mg mL \u00c01 , Actavis AB, Sweden). Sufentanil and midazolam were mixed with sterile water to a concentration of 2.3 lg mL \u00c01 and 0.45 mg mL \u00c01 , respectively. The mixture was administered at 0.3 mL kg \u00c01 hour \u00c01 , equivalent to a dose of 0.7 lg kg \u00c01 hour \u00c01 sufentanil and 0.14 mg kg \u00c01 hour \u00c01 midazolam, with a syringe pump (Braun Compact S, B. Braun Melsungen AG, Germany). Additionally, every 20 seconds a bolus (0.05 mL) of the mixture was injected until the righting reflex was lost and the jaw muscles relaxed (end of induction). The larynx was sprayed with 0.25 mL of lidocaine (Xylocaine 10 mg mL \u00c01 , AstraZeneca,, Sweden), and oxygen was delivered at 1 L minute \u00c01 via face mask for 60 seconds.

The SEVO vaporizer (Ohmeda Tech 5, Datex Ohmeda, Sweden) was set initially at a delivery concentration of 1%, delivered in 1.5 L oxygen minute \u00c01 and 0.5 L medical air minute \u00c01 . The rabbits were allowed to breathe spontaneously, unless apnoea occurred (no breath in 30 seconds), in which case manual compression of a 0.5 L breathing bag was performed. Additional blood gas examinations were performed after initiation of manual ventilation to maintain a partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) between 5 and 8 kPa (38-60 mmHg).In group SUF-MID the endotracheal tube was connected to a ventilator (Servo Ventilator 300, Siemens-Elema AB, Solna, Sweden) in case of apnoea. The ventilator was not compatible with the use of volatile anaesthetic agents and therefore not used in group SEVO. A mixture of 1.5 L oxygen and 0.5 L air was provided via the same breathing system as in group SEVO. The ventilator was used in pressure mode with a pressure of 8-19 cm H 2 O, a respiratory frequency of 12-30 minute \u00c01 and an inspiratory: expiratory duration ratio of 1:3. The aim was to maintain PaCO 2 between 5 and 8 kPa (38-60 mmHg).The rabbits were placed in dorsal recumbency on an electric heating pad and prepared for surgery. The fur was clipped on the ventral abdomen, the surgical site cleansed with soap and water and scrubbed with antiseptic solution. Sterile surgical drapes were applied to prevent contamination of the surgical site. Intravenous Ringer acetate was administered at 20 mL kg \u00c01 hour \u00c01 during anaesthesia. During surgery, the administration of SUF-MID or SEVO was adjusted to a plane of surgical anaesthesia, by increasing and decreasing the rate of administration by 10% from baseline depending on the degree muscle relaxation, motor reactions and/or changes in HR and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) during surgery.

The sampling rate for gas analysis was 200 mL minute \u00c01 . Arterial blood samples (0.2 mL) were collected for analyses of blood gases, glucose and lactate with a portable analyzer (CG4+ and CG8+ cartridges, i-STAT1 Portable Clinical Analyzer, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Scandinavia AB, Sweden).The following variables were recorded in medetomidine premedicated rabbits: f R , HR, saturation of peripheral arterial haemoglobin (SpO 2 ), PaCO 2 , pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2 ), MAP, blood glucose and lactate. During anaesthesia and surgery, f R , HR, SpO 2 , MAP, rectal temperature (RT), SUF-MID infusion rate (group SUF-MID) and end tidal SEVO concentration (group SEVO) were recorded every 10 minutes. Arterial blood gases, glucose and lactate were measured every 30 minutes. During three hours following surgery, HR, f R and RT were recorded every 15 minutes and arterial blood gases, glucose and lactate concentrations every 45 minutes."", ""Post-operative care"": ""After completion of surgery, the anaesthesia delivery was discontinued and the oxygen-air mixture was delivered until extubation, after which the rabbits were placed in a heated cage for three hours. Times to extubation and return of the righting reflex were recorded. Buprenorphine (Temgesic, RB Pharmaceuticals Limited, UK) was administered three hours post surgery SC at a dose of 0.05 mg kg \u00c01 . The reason for the delay in administration was that a simultaneous study of facial expression for the evaluation of pain according to Keating et al. (2012) was carried out. The study required that the rabbits were scored after they had fully recovered from anaesthesia (not sedated), and before buprenorphine administration. For scoring, the rabbits were filmed for 20 minutes and photographed in a cage with a Plexiglas front before and one hour after buprenorphine administration. The result of pain scoring will be reported elsewhere. Rabbits that had not recovered the righting reflex within 60 minutes after surgery, or became apnoeic postoperatively, were administered naloxone or atipamezole, depending on the group assignment. Any rabbit that seemed to suffer from more than slight pain (e.g. grinding teeth) was administered buprenorphine for rescue therapy.For a week following surgery, the rabbits were examined clinically and weighed daily. Rabbits that were not eating normally were hand fed with crushed pelleted feed mixed with water several times a day, until normal food intake returned. Carprofen was administered every 24 hours for two-three days post-operatively at a dose of 5 mg kg \u00c01 SC.After completion of the study, twelve rabbits were euthanized and six were re-homed. For euthanasia, an IV injection of pentobarbital (Apotekets avliv-ningsv\u20ac atska, Kronans Droghandel, Sweden) was administered in the auricular vein after sedation with medetomidine 0.1 mg kg \u00c01 and application of local anaesthetic cream on the skin over the ear. Rabbits that were not re-homed underwent a complete necropsy at the National Veterinary Institute (Uppsala, Sweden)."", ""Statistical evaluation"": ""After testing for normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test), a Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney Rank sum test were used for comparison of nonrepeated measures between groups (times to induction, intubation, extubation, and recovery of the righting reflex, duration of anaesthesia and surgery). The anaesthetic period was divided into surgical preparations (PREP) and surgery (SUR), since the dose of anaesthesia was adjusted to the different requirements, and thereby may have had an effect on the variables studied. Moreover, since the timepoints for the start of PREP, SUR and the postoperative period (POST) differed in each rabbit, mean values were calculated for every rabbit for repeated measures analyses (HR, SpO 2 , PaCO 2 , PaO 2 , MAP, RT, blood glucose and lactate) during PREP, SUR and POST. Individual means were used to establish group means. Group means for PREP, SUR and POST were compared with values recorded during sedation (SED) in a two way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Holm-Sidak post-hoc test. Postoperative body weights were compared with body weights on the day of surgery in a two way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Holm-Sidak post-hoc test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Data are presented as mean AE SD."", ""Complications"": ""During recovery from anaesthesia, two rabbits in group SUF-MID and one in group SEVO showed neurological signs, including nystagmus, head tilt, opistotonus and convulsions at arterial blood sampling. The symptoms only lasted a few seconds and therefore no treatment was initiated. One of these rabbits (in group SUF-MID) showed reduced activity and food intake for three days, and a head tilt for five days postoperatively. Two rabbits in group SEVO needed hand feeding on the first post-operative day. In three rabbits, one in group SUF-MID and two in Figure 1 Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) in Himalayan rabbits during sedation (0 min), preparation for surgery (PREP), and ovariohysterectomy (SUR) during anaesthesia with sufentanilmidazolam -\u25cb-(n = 7) or sevoflurane --(n = 9). The time for start and end of surgery varied between animals and the horizontal bars represent the mean time. Results are mean AE SD. group SEVO, dry necrosis of part of the ear developed in the area of arterial catheter placement within a week after surgery. Two of these rabbits were the same as those showing neurological symptoms. At necropsy an area of coagulative necrosis in the cerebral cortex was observed in the rabbit with the tilted head. In all other rabbits undergoing necropsy, no changes were observed."", ""Discussion"": ""In healthy rabbits, SUF-MID seems to be at least as efficacious as SEVO for providing anaesthesia during abdominal surgery. The overall quality of anaesthesia was similar for both groups, although SEVO was associated with an increase in HR during and after surgery, and a postoperative body weight loss of 4%. Anaesthesia with SUF-MID, in contrast, was associated with a stable HR during surgery and a stable postoperative body weight. One reason for considering opioid-based anaesthesia, is the limited cardiovascular effects, which has been documented to be the case for SUF-MID in rabbits (Hedenqvist et al. 2014 ) and dogs (Hellebrekers & Sap 1991) previously. In humans it was shown that sufentanil blunts the stress response during surgery, as well as post-operatively (Desborough & Hall 1989) , and that a reduced stress response decreases the risk of cardiac complications during surgery (Wijeysundera et al. 2009 ).In the present study, specific-pathogen free rabbits were used. The effects of anaesthesia may be different in rabbits with subclinical or clinical disease, and especially in pet rabbits which frequently have upper respiratory diseases (Rougier et al. 2006 ). Whenever full l-opioid agonist based anaesthesia protocols are used, it is recommended to administer buprenorphine immediately after completion of surgery, to antagonise respiratory depression, decrease time to recovery, and provide long-lasting pain relief. Since the rabbits were additionally part of a pain behaviour study (results reported elsewhere), it was necessary to postpone buprenorphine administration for facial pain scoring to be possible before the administration of further analgesics. Since the first rabbits in group SUF-MID remained sedated for 3 hours, that time point was selected for the scoring. However, all rabbits received carprofen preoperatively; hence, they were not completely devoid of analgesic treatment. Five rabbits were administered naloxone or atipamezole postoperatively, but we anticipate that it did not have an impact on pain scoring 3 hours after surgery.The righting reflex was not recovered until 30 minutes after end of surgery in group SEVO and 60 minutes in group SUF-MID, which may cause concern. The long duration of surgery (60 minutes) and the delay in buprenorphine administration in group SUF-MID probably contributed to this. In a previous study with SUF-MID anesthesia, buprenorphine was administered immediately after 60 minutes of orthopedic surgery in rabbits, and rabbits recovered within 30 minutes (Hedenqvist et al. 2014 ). The recommendation is thus for several reasons to administer buprenorphine immediately after completion of surgery.Rigidity has been described to occur during anaesthetic induction with high doses of opioids e.g. in pigs (Schumann et al. 1994) , and in rabbits IV xylaxinealfentanil-midazolam anaesthesia caused convulsions (Borkowski et al. 1990 ). Alfentanil has been in Himalayan rabbits during one week after ovariohysterectomy under anaesthesia with sufentanilmidazolam -\u25cb-(n = 9) or sevoflurane --(n = 9). *p < 0.05 compared with postoperative day 0.shown to induce convulsions more easily in humans compared with sufentanil and fentanyl (Smith et al. 1989 ). In the present study, anaesthesia was induced slowly to prevent rigidity and convulsions, with a SUF-MID ratio that was established not to cause rigidity in a previous study (Hedenqvist et al. 2013) . Rigidity may also have been prevented by the use of medetomidine pre-medication. Medetomidine has been shown to reduce induced seizures in rats (Airaksinen et al. 2012) . In more recent studies, sufentanil-midazolam anaesthesia induction has been simplified by using a higher initial infusion rate, and omitting the bolus administration (personal observation, P Hedenqvist).The seizures that occurred in three rabbits postoperatively were probably not related to anaesthesia (one was in group SEVO), but to flushing of the ear artery catheter. The likely cause was embolization after thrombus formation in the ear artery catheter, which is supported by the result from necropsy of one rabbit, which showed a necrotic area in the cerebral cortex. Physiological saline was used as lock solution in the arterial catheters. which has been described to be satisfactory in studies in humans (Del Cotillo et al. 2008) . Ear necrosis, which also occurred in the present study, has been described in small rabbits after catheterization of the auricular artery (Harcourt-Brown 2002) . Catheter placement was found more difficult in Himalayan rabbits compared with the larger NZW rabbit. Complications from arterial catheterisation are less likely to occur in the clinic, since blood pressure is not usually measured invasively. Whenever catheter placement is performed however, great care must be taken not to damage the artery and heparinized saline should be used as lock solution.The mean concentration of SEVO during surgery in the present study was 2.1% in the Himalayan rabbits, which is 40% lower than the reported MAC value of 3.7% in unpremedicated NZW Rabbits (Scheller et al. 1988 ). This magnitude is similar to the reduction of isoflurane MAC by pre-medication with medetomidine, observed in pigs (Malavasi et al. 2008 ) and dogs (Weitz et al. 1991 ). In the present study not only medetomidine, but also the SUF-MID used for induction may have had an effect on the SEVO concentration required for surgical anaesthesia.Oxygen saturation and arterial partial pressure were satisfactory at almost every measured time point. The lowest values for both parameters were encountered during sedation, before oxygen was delivered. Pulse oximeter measurement was not successful in all rabbits because of difficulties to reattach an incorrectly placed probe on the tail during surgery. A limitation of the study was that the method of assisted ventilation varied between groups, and probably why SEVO rabbits were hypercapnic during preparation for surgery. During surgery however, normocapnia was present in both groups. It is likely that surgical stimulation contributed to the decrease from PREP to SUR in PaCO 2 in group SEVO.In summary, SUF-MID provided a similar quality of anaesthesia to that of SEVO in medetomidine premedicated Himalayan rabbits, and seems to be at least as efficacious as SEVO for providing surgical anaesthesia. Cardiovascular conditions were more stable in group SUF-MID, however, respiratory depression was more pronounced and required IPPV Further, no postoperative body weight loss was seen after SUF-MID anaesthesia.""}",Intravenous sufentanil-midazolam versus sevoflurane anaesthesia in medetomidine pre-medicated Himalayan rabbits undergoing ovariohysterectomy,"Abstract Objective To compare physiological effects of sufentanil-midazolam with sevoflurane for surgical anaesthesia in medetomidine premedicated rabbits. Study design Prospective, randomized controlled experimental study. Animals Eighteen female Himalayan rabbits, weight 2.1 ± 0.1 kg. Methods Premedication with 0.1 mg kg−1 medetomidine and 5 mg kg−1 carprofen subcutaneously, was followed by intravenous anaesthetic induction with sufentanil (2.3 μg mL−1) and midazolam (0.45 mg mL−1). After endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained with sufentanil-midazolam (n = 9) or sevoflurane (n = 9). Ovariohysterectomy was performed. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation was performed as required. Physiological variables were studied perioperatively. Group means of physiologic data were generated for different anaesthetic periods. Data were compared for changes from sedation, and between groups by anova. Post-operatively, 0.05 mg kg−1 buprenorphine was administered once and 5 mg kg−1 carprofen once daily for 2–3 days. Rabbits were examined and weighed daily until one week after surgery. Results Smooth induction of anaesthesia was achieved within 5 minutes. Sufentanil and midazolam doses were 0.5 μg kg−1 and 0.1 mg kg−1, during induction and 3.9 μg kg−1 hour−1 and 0.8 mg kg−1 hour−1 during surgery, respectively. End-tidal sevoflurane concentration was 2.1% during surgery. Assisted ventilation was required in nine rabbits receiving sufentanil-midazolam and four receiving sevoflurane. There were no differences between groups in physiologic data other than arterial carbon dioxide. In rabbits receiving sevoflurane, mean arterial pressure decreased pre-surgical intervention, heart rate increased 25% during and after surgery and body weight decreased 4% post-operatively. Post-operative problems sometimes resulted from catheterization of the ear artery. Conclusion Sevoflurane and sufentanil-midazolam provided surgical anaesthesia of similar quality. Arterial blood pressure was sustained during sufentanil-midazolam anaesthesia and rabbits receiving sevoflurane lost body weight following ovariohysterectomy. Mechanical ventilation was required with both anaesthetic regimens. Clinical relevance Anaesthesia with sufentanil-midazolam in medetomidine premedicated healthy rabbits is useful in the clinical and the research setting, as an alternative to sevoflurane.",10.1111/vaa.12207,Elsevier; Medline; PMC,PMC7185500,25041686.0,els-covid,2015-07-31,Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia,,,,7221052.0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1467298716302033; https://doi.org/10.1111/vaa.12207; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1467298716302033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25041686/,2015.0,paper

Although challenging without strict containment measures, identification of these subjects may slow the spread of SARS-CoV2. The cases of Veneto and Lombardia, contemporaneously affected neighboring regions in Italy, provide 2 telling examples with strikingly different endings. As of April 15, 2020, a total of 44,107 tests per million people have been performed in Veneto, which is double the number of tests conducted in Lombardia (Fig. 1) . Indeed, in contrast to the neighboring region, Veneto adopted a large-scale population screening model at the beginning of the outbreak, allowing home isolation for a larger number of mild (or asymptomatic) cases (85% vs 60% of active cases according to the last estimates). 4 This strategy may have avoided overwhelming the health system, with a consequent positive impact on the case fatality rate in Veneto, which is currently almost 3 times lower than that in Lombardia.In fact, in line with previous modeling predictions, 5 Lombardia did run out of intensive care beds at the end of March, resulting in the need to transfer critical patients to other Italian regions or European countries. Furthermore, between one-half and one-third of the daily national deaths are still being recorded in this region at this time.At a time when Italy is facing its biggest challenge since World War II, the 'Veneto model' indicates that early mass screening for SARS-CoV-2 can make a positive difference, and it should be recommended to other countries responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.""}",Coronavirus disease 2019 in Italy: The Veneto model,,10.1017/ice.2020.225,Medline; PMC,PMC7248594,32389164.0,cc-by,2020-05-11,Infection control and hospital epidemiology,,,,218584208.0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32389164/; https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2020.225,2020.0,paper

Data were analysed using Stata 15.1 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA)."", ""Results"": ""On a PubMed search on 15 April 2020, no articles on physician deaths and COVID-19 were found. However, one letter discussed the death of 23 Chinese health care workers from COVID-19, two of whom were physicians [2] . Our internet search focused on physician deaths related to COVID-19 infection due to front-line work or interactions with work colleagues. The date of the reports ranged from 7 February 2020 to 15 April 2020. Complete age details were only available on 173 physicians. The Italian National Federation of Medicine Surgery and Odontology [3] had a complete list of physician deaths in the country from COVID-19. The deaths in other countries required compilation from numerous web articles.Four physicians who were patient-facing but not proven to have COVID infection were not included in the final database; the apparent reasons for death included 'cardiac compromise' or 'exhaustion' [4] [5] [6] [7] . Doctors that died from COVID infection not attributed to front-line work or interaction with work colleagues were also excluded [8, 9] .Physicians older than 90 years of age were excluded from this study. The age details were missing for 49 individuals. The average age of the physicians that died was 63.5 years (range 28-90 years) and the median age was 66.0 years. Physicians 59 years of age or older accounted for three-quarters of COVID-related deaths.Ninety per cent (175/194) of the deceased physicians were male. General practitioners and emergency room doctors (78/254), respirologists (5/254), internal medicine specialists (11/254) and anaesthesiologists (6/254) comprised 52% of those dying. Two per cent of the deceased were epidemiologists (4/254), 2% were infectious disease specialists (4/254), 4% were ENT (8/254), 4% were ophthalmologists (7/254) and 5% were dentists (9/254) (see Table 1 )."", ""Key learning points"": ""What is already known about this subject: \u2022 COVID-19 is associated with an overall worldwide mortality of ~7%."", ""What this study adds:"": ""\u2022 Physicians from almost all specialties have died from COVID-19.\u2022 The majority of physicians that died from COVID-19 were of older age.What impact this may have on practice or policy: \u2022 All physicians require personal protective equipment, appropriate for their specialty. \u2022 If possible, older physicians should avoid front-line work with COVID-19 patients. Twenty-three per cent (58/192) of the physicians practised a surgical speciality with average age 62.9 years, compared to their primary care or medicine colleagues of average age 64.0 years. There was no statistically significant difference between the ages of the surgeons and non-surgeons (t-test, P = 0.61).The countries with the most reported physician deaths were Italy (121/278; 44%), Iran (43/278; 15%), Philippines (21/278; 8%), Indonesia (17/278; 6%), China (16/278; 6%), Spain (12/278; 4%), USA (12/278; 4%) and UK (11/278; 4%) (see Table 2 )."", ""Discussion"": ""Death in the line of duty is the doctor's ultimate sacrifice, which may be compounded when physicians unknowingly infect family members [10] . The general public may not comprehend the importance of self-isolation measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic until a physician dies fighting the virus [11] .We acknowledge the limitations of this paper. The number of physician deaths from COVID-19 is likely under-reported given our criteria for proven infection, the rapidly changing course of the pandemic, and because national mortality figures may not be available or accurately reported if all patients are not tested. Although reliance on social media searches is suboptimal, it may be the only accessible source of information, especially in countries with limited press freedom. We could not discern if the physicians died from COVID-19 or underlying conditions with an associated viral infection. Pre-existing medical morbidities were not uniformly reported. We did not examine the number of physicians infected with COVID who have not died; nor did we enumerate the mortality of our nursing and allied health colleagues.Physician deaths from COVID-19 may vary between countries due to the time of disease outbreak, differential public health resources, governmental policies and controls to enforce quarantine and social distancing, face mask wear, the amount of testing performed, ascertainment bias, available medical supplies and technology and social greeting habits [12] . Nations such as Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan that exercised decisive action to prevent travel from affected regions, strict enforcement of quarantines and widespread testing contained the epidemic had few reported physician deaths [13] . South Korea had no physician or nurse deaths from COVID-19 until 10 weeks after their disease outbreak [14, 15] . As the disease onset in North America and the UK lagged behind Asia and Europe, the coming weeks may reveal a rise in COVID-19related physician deaths in these regions. On 15 April 2020, there were at least 15 COVID-19-related physician deaths in North America. An increasing number of North American physicians have contracted COVID-19 and are in critical care [16] .Physicians from almost all the medical specialities from psychiatry to urology have succumbed to workrelated COVID-19. Practitioners working in the airway such as dentists, otorhinolaryngologists and anaesthesiologists are especially at risk for COVID-19 infection and this group comprised 12% of all physician deaths. Dentists are in close proximity to oral secretions for prolonged periods and their high-speed handpiece and ultrasonic instruments aerosolize body fluids. In our review 6% of the fatalities were dentists. Surprisingly, a recent paper from China [17] no dentists were reported to die from COVID-19 contracted during patient encounters. Ophthalmologists also work for extended periods close to oronasal secretions. Dr Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist from China who first alerted the world to COVID-19, died from the disease at the age of 33 years. Subsequently, two more ophthalmologists at Li's workplace passed from COVID-19, perhaps due to prolonged proximity to the airway of infected patients during ophthalmoscopy, tear transmission of the virus or from nasolacrimal manipulations.Lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and inadequate PPE were commonly cited as a cause of death especially in developing nations and Italy [18] . When PPE is available, proper donning and doffing techniques are required. If adequate manpower is available work teams with a primary examiner, safety monitor and scribe may decrease the risk of inadvertent contamination. Patients who lied about their travel history of infectious contacts have also been attributed to physician deaths from COVID-19 [13] . Mandatory passport inspections during pandemics might avert the former. Meticulous public health investigations and expeditious location of all contacts assisted by smartphone tracking might prevent the latter.Health care workers endure considerable mental and physical stress caring for patients with COVID-19. A French physician committed suicide after discovering he was infected [19] . An American emergency room doctor took her own life after recovering from COVID-19 [20] . At least three physicians, supposedly without viral infection, died from exhaustion or cardiac compromise [4, 5] , and one was 28 years old [6] . During pandemics, hospitals should organize physician shifts with mandatory rest and meal breaks. Medical societies can bolster online supports to keep doctors connected with their colleagues for information and social support. The government can help physicians care for their families, provide lodging closer to the hospital and legislate life insurance enhancements.Purported risk factors for severe disease and death in COVID-19 include older age, male gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease and immunocompromise [21] . Senior physicians and those with co-morbidities ideally should not be assigned to front-line work with COVID-19 patients, but instead duties such as video or phone assessments, consulting or public liaison [22] .Italian physicians have suggested that a communitycentred or home care system for COVID-19 rather than a hospital-focused system might decrease the transmission of disease and physician exposure [23] .Patient monitoring technologies that track pulse oximetry and vital signs and medical robots allow doctors and nurses to remotely assess and treat infected patients, can enhance patient care and decrease risks to health care workers. At present robots that take temperatures, deliver food and supplies, and disinfect rooms have been described [24] . However, in countries without resources for even gloves or masks, robots are wishful thinking.In summary, physicians from almost all medical specialities have succumbed to COVID-19, and all require taskappropriate personal protective PPE. We are in the initial phase of the pandemic and the number of physician fatalities will increase. Doctors who were 59 years of age or older accounted for three-quarters of COVID-19-related deaths. If senior or retired physicians are recalled to work during the COVID-19 crisis [25] , consideration should be made to place them away from the front line due to the higher risk of mortality, and the increased likelihood of burden to the medical system if they become infected."", ""Funding"": ""None declared.""}",Physician deaths from corona virus (COVID-19) disease,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused much morbidity and mortality to patients but also health care providers.

Health care systems internationally struggle to provide an adequate response to the current outbreak, while the number of people infected with a new coronavirus disease continues to grow exponentially [1] . Worldwide, a number of countries, Poland among them, transformed a portion of general hospitals into designated COVID centers, as one of the measures to contain disease spread and rationalize resources [2, 3] . Health care providers who work at the frontline are under the extreme pressure. Increased workload, fear for their families, scarcity of personal protective equipment, and a lack of access to rapid testing are among the main problems which may negatively influence their wellbeing at work [4] . Although the new coronavirus disease is not a surgical condition per se, given the number of infected individuals in the communities, a portion of patients with COVID-19 require surgical care. Surgical personnel are at an immense risk of exposure due to the high-risk procedures performed in the operating theatre [5] . Although multiple guidelines have been original article published by various international surgical societies regarding the appropriate management of surgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, they differ in various aspects [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . The unprecedented situation may contribute to additional anxiety among surgical doctors, especially if they lack the required training and protective equipment. This study aimed to assess surgeons' attitude towards surgical practice in relation to the hospitals' preparations made during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the surgical wards of Polish hospitals."", ""Materials and methods"": ""We conducted an anonymous web-based national survey among Polish general surgeons from March 30 to April 6, 2020. The survey was conducted in collaboration with the Association of Polish Surgeons (APS) and the National Consultant in General Surgery and covered the domains of surgeons and their workplace characteristics, information sources, knowledge, risk perception, and preparedness related to the COVID-19 pandemic."", ""Survey instrument"": ""The 27-item self-administered questionnaire was designed based on the literature review of previous viral outbreaks [11, 12] . The questions were translated into Polish and adjusted to fit the COVID-19 outbreak and suit the local settings. Open-ended questions were limited to reduce information bias. The survey was sent to the president of the APS and the National Consultant in General Surgery to obtain their opinions regarding its simplicity and full content. This was followed by a pilot study, which was performed with 10 surgeons from our institution. According to that, the final questionnaire was determined by the authors.The survey comprised four sections. The first captured demographic and workplace characteristics of the participants and whether they were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The second part assessed surgeons' sources of information and asked responders to rate their level of knowledge about COVID-19 and the degree of adjustments made in their hospital. Respondents were asked to self-assess their level of general knowledge about COVID-19. The 1-10 rating scale was used, where 1 meant no knowledge about COVID-19 and 10 the knowledge at an expert level. Similarly, they were asked to evaluate the amount of COVID-19 pandemic-related training and personal protective equipment (PPE) provided at their workplace on the 1-10 rating scale, 1 being none provided and 10 above the required level.The third section assessed responders' perception of COVID risk. The fourth section asked the responders' opinion about the surgery-specific queries such as changes in working hours, types of surgeries per-formed during the pandemic, and preferred surgical approach."", ""Survey distribution"": ""The survey was distributed via email to the APS members on March 30, 2020, and posted on two Polish online surgical discussion groups and the APS website."", ""Inclusion and exclusion criteria"": ""The study group included Polish general surgeons and surgical trainees working in public hospitals who granted informed consent to participate in the study. Retired surgeons, physicians, and trainees in surgical specializations other than general surgery, medical interns, medical students, and other health care professionals were excluded from this study."", ""Data analysis"": ""All data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics included frequency counts and percentages for categorical variables and means for continuous variables. Fear of contracting the disease and fear of death were dichotomized into yes vs. not/not sure. Quantitative data were compared made using Mann-Whitney's test for non-parametric data and chi-square test for dichotomized outcomes. To determine independent variables which may correlate with the likelihood of fear of contracting COVID-19, a logistic regression was performed. All reported p-values are two tailed, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant."", ""Results"": ""Among 304 responders who were eligible and who fully completed the survey, the age ranged from 26-74 years (mean age 41.8 years), 30.6% were women. Of the responders, 41 surgeons (13.5%) reported being directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients (18 surgeons working in COVID centers and 23 surgeons working in non-COVID centers), 130 (42.6%) were working in the hospital with COVID-19 patients (39 surgeons working in COVID centers and 90 surgeons working in non-COVID centers), and over a half of respondents (52.4%) declared having no COVID-19 patients in their hospital.Professional literature, such as medical journals and WHO/ECDC guidelines, online discussion groups, and information at the workplace were the main selfreported sources of knowledge about COVID-19 disease (79.2%, 51.6%, and 49.3%, respectively; Table 1 ).The mean self-reported knowledge about COVID-19 was 6.03 (SD = 1.7), with only 20.3% of surgeons assessing their knowledge at \u22658. The mean training provided at work during the new coronavirus outbreak was evaluated at 3.53 (SD = 2.49), with 59.5% of re-General surgeons' attitudes towards COVID-19 spondents marking it \u22643. Similarly, the mean mark for an adequate level of PPE provided at the workplace was 3.34 (SD 2.38), with 50.3% reporting it at \u22642, which means none or minimal PPE (Fig. 1) . Two thirds (62.7%) of surgeons believed that they would contract COVID-19 during their work in the hospital. However, approximately three quarters of all (74.5%) were afraid of contracting the disease, mainly during the time of caring for in-hospital patients (184, 80.7%), from other staff members at work (184, 80.7%) and in out-patient clinics (87, 38.1%). Furthermore, 130 (42%) expressed a fear for their own life while taking care for COVID-19 patients. The great majority of respondents conceived that there is a high risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 virus to family members (271, 89.1%) and they were afraid of transmitting the disease to the family members (274, 90.1%; Fig. 2 ). The average age was significantly higher in the group who was afraid of dying from COVID-19 than in the group who was not afraid (43.33 vs. 40.79, p = 0.045). However, there were no statistically significant differences in age between surgeons who were afraid of contracting the disease compared to those who were not afraid (p = 0.98).Similarly, the average reported level of PPE provided at the workplace was significantly higher in the group which was not afraid of contracting COVID-19 than among the group afraid of contracting COVID-19 (4.0 vs. 3.12, p = 0.02). Also, the average level of PPE provided at the workplace was significantly higher in These factors were used to build a multivariable regression model which revealed that solely an adequate PPE supply at the workplace was an independent variable influencing the fear of contracting COVID-19.There were no statistically significant associations between the fear of contracting the disease or dying from COVID-19 and gender, career level, the level of knowledge about COVID-19, and the amount of COVID-19 training provided at the workplace. Likewise, it was irrelevant whether respondents were working in COVID centers or had been directly involved in the care of patients suffering from COVID-19 or not.A total of 182 surgeons (59.9%) reported having an additional employment, such as private practice, outpatient clinics, or on-call shifts in different hospitals. Among them, 32% limited and 53.2% temporarily discontinued their additional employment. Similarly, when asking about the rota changes, 83.3% of respondents thought that the surgical rota should be switched to an on-call rota only and 41% believed that surgeons over 60 years old should be exempted from work during the pandemic, with only 10% believing that the normal rota shifts should be continued.Similarly, only a minor proportion of surgeons (11.1%) were likely to continue all planned surgeries for patients with a confirmed COVID-negative RT-PCR swab test. However, nearly all (93.8%) agreed that cancer surgeries should be continued, either for all cancer patients (36.9%) or for those with confirmed COVID-negative RT-PCR swab tests (56.2%). When asking about the preferred surgical technique in conditions where the laparoscopic approach has been well established as a gold standard, such as cholecystectomy or appendicectomy, 149 respondents (49%) selected laparoscopy as the method of choice when performing this type of surgery on COVID-positive patients. While 89 surgeons (29.3%) would, in this situation, use the open technique and 66 surgeons (21.8%) either did not know which approach is safer or believed that there is no difference."", ""Discussion"": ""To our knowledge, this is the first study that aimed to assess surgeons' attitudes towards surgical practice in relation to hospitals' preparations made during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the surgical wards in Polish hospitals. Appropriate level of PPE and age were important factors influencing whether surgeons were more likely to be afraid of COVID-19. The great majority of surgeons believed that the surgical rota should be adjusted to minimize their risk of exposure.While professional literature was the most frequently used source of information, only half of responders were provided with information about the new coronavirus pandemic at their workplace. Interestingly, online discussion groups were the second most common source of information about COVID-19, and social media were more popular than tele-General surgeons' attitudes towards COVID-19 K original article vision and newspapers. Using an online source as a main reference point has the undoubted advantage of being able to keep up to date, which is particularly important during such a dynamic situation as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, they may not be as well verified as printed information and therefore may lack credibility.Furthermore, our study revealed that an overwhelming proportion of surgeons reported fear of contracting COVID-19 along with a significant number of respondents expressing a fear for their own life while working during the pandemic. Surgeons who were afraid of death were older than those who were not afraid. This may be explained by the fact that advanced age strongly correlates with the likelihood of suffering a more severe form of COVID-19 and that the case fatality rate is significantly higher among people over 65 years old [13, 14] . Perhaps this is why nearly half of respondents whished that surgeons over 60 years of age were exempt from work during the pandemic.The amount of PPE provided to surgical wards stood at a staggeringly low level, as by the time the epidemic started in Poland, the global stock of PPE was already depleted and the country struggled to acquire an adequate number of masks and gowns. According to the national strategy implemented by the Ministry of Health in Poland, the treatment of all patients with confirmed COVID-19 should occur in designated COVID centers; therefore, those institutions were prioritized when supplying hospitals with PPE. The remaining hospitals received a limited supply of PPE. Moreover, an adequate level of PPE was the only contributing factor which was significantly associated with the fear of contracting the disease among surgeons. Our findings are in keeping with a recently published letter from one of the hospitals in China, where authors indicated that adequate PPE and uninterrupted rest were the only two requirements indicated by healthcare providers working during the outbreak [15] . Similarly, Shanafel et al. placed access to appropriate personal protective equipment as one of the main concerns among frontline healthcare providers [4] . Therefore, sufficient stock of PPE in every hospital should become a priority if we wish to minimize the level of fear among surgeons working during the pandemic and the possible long-term consequences of working in an unsafe environment [16] .Interestingly, at the time of this study, a significant proportion of patients suffering from COVID-19 were still hospitalized in non-COVID-dedicated hospitals. This may explain why surgeons working in the hospitals which are not assigned for treatment of COVID-19 patients displayed the same level of anxiety as surgeons working in dedicated COVID centers.The great majority of surgeons preferred replacing normal rota hours with the on-call rota only during the peak of the pandemic, which may also indirectly indicate their unwillingness to attend work during the outbreak. Similarly, a substantial percentage believed that only lifesaving procedures, such as emergency and cancer surgeries, should be continued in this period.Finally, the survey revealed differences in the perceived safety of laparoscopy. This may reflect the fact that the guidelines published by various international surgical bodies at the time of our survey were inconsistent in this matter. While the European Association of Endoscopic Surgery considered laparoscopy safe for SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, the Royal College of Surgeons in England advised an open technique for every procedure performed on COVID-19 patients [6, 10] . The evidence against laparoscopy was relatively weak and derived from research performed on different pathogens [17, 18] . Still, a high proportion of surgeons preferred an open approach, which may support the theory that their clinical decision was driven more by the fear for their personal safety than it was based on well-established evidence."", ""Limitations"": ""The study has several limitations. First, while the study population was representative of membership in the nation's largest surgical organizations, it may not represent all Polish surgeons. Second, the study was conducted in an early phase of the pandemic and was carried out during 7 days; therefore, the situation may be a subject to change. Third, the survey used an unvalidated questionnaire and the anxiety level was not established based on psychometric tests; therefore, about its long-term consequences are of limited value. This can represent, however, a pilot study for future research. Fourth, a major limitation was also a self-assessment of knowledge and subjective opinions about workplace adaptations which may therefore be prone to bias. Finally, we were unable to calculate the response rate of the participants as the survey was not only sent to individual email addresses, but also published on the surgical websites; therefore, we cannot estimate how many surgeons could have participated in it."", ""Conclusion"": ""A high proportion of surgeons admitted being afraid of working during the COVID-19 pandemic, which had various implications for their attitude towards surgical practice. Protecting health care workers is an important component of public health measures for addressing the epidemic. Lack of adequate support may result in serious mental health consequences and surgeons' unwillingness to continue their practice.Ethical standards All the participants were informed about the objectives of the study in the invitation part.

Since 1883, the synthesis of antipyrine (1) by Knorr, numerous attention has caused by the analgesic and antipyretic activities of pyrazolone analogues [1] . The discovery of these features encouraged the researches to synthesize other pyrazolone derivatives with similar behavior but with a better therapeutic action. Nowadays, multiple FDA approved drugs containing pyrazolone nucleus have been explored (Fig. 2) , for instances, edaravone (2) has been used as free radical scavenger for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [2] , aminophenazone (3) with antipyretic and anti-inflammatory activities has been used in breath tests to measure the cytochrome P-450 metabolic activity in liver function evaluations [3] , eltrombopag (4) has been used for the treatment of low blood platelet counts in adults with idiopathic chronic immune thrombocytopenia [4] , dichloralphenazone (5) has been used for the relief of tension and vascular headaches [5] , metamizole (6) has been used for perioperative pain, cancer pain, acute injury and other forms of pain and is considered as the strongest antipyretic [6] . Several investigational small molecules containing pyrazolone have been regarded as drug candidates including sulfamazone (7) [7] , propyphenazone (8) [8] and nifenazone (9) [9] .Regarding pyrazolone derivatives, it is important to underline the enormous diversity of classes of synthetic pyrazolone published in existing studies. As for the pharmacology investigators, this review is a concise and critical account focusing on the properties of pyrazolones as antimicrobial, antitumor, CNS effect, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, anti-tubercular, antiviral, lipidlowering, antihyperglycemic agents and protein inhibitors. We summarized advances of pyrazolone derivatives as well as their SAR (10e189). Currently, the existing reviews [10, 11] about pyrazolone derivatives are mainly concerning their catalytic asymmetric synthesis or coordination, the comprehensive review of the bioactivity and the SAR studies are still vacant. This review is in order to fill gaps of systematic summarization of biological activities and SAR that could be beneficial for researchers to design novel pyrazolone derivatives, in addition, docking analysis is used to explain interactions between some typical pyrazolone derivatives and potential targets to give a visual appreciation of the roles of pyrazolone group play in the bioactivity."", ""Synthetic strategies of pyrazolones"": ""Recent advances in the synthesis of pyrazolones have been reported in the literature [12] . Condensation of hydrazines with bketoester compounds is the classical method for the synthesis of pyrazolones (Scheme 1), the catalytic conditions are usually the use of organic base like piperidine or inorganic base like NaH in the system of the boiling ethanol or methanol solvent. The nucleus of pyrazolones has been widely used to ulteriorly synthesize broad range of derivatives including spiroheterocycles and acylation productions [13] , which features multiple reactive sites. The electrophilic substitution at the C-4 position of pyrazolones is an effective synthetic route for the construction of pyrazolones linked with chiral groups and 4-disubstituted pyrazolones. In addition, as an important synthon, a, b-unsaturated pyrazolones (R 1 : C]C-R`/ C]N-R`/C]O) can be transformed into diverse pyrazolones. When R 1 is C]C-R 0 , they can undergo 1,4-Michael addition as acceptors to generate 4-substituted pyrazole analogues."", ""Pharmacological profile of pyrazolones"": ""The broad-spectrum of pharmacology properties about pyrazolone derivatives have been reported including antimicrobial, antitumor, CNS activity, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitubercular, antiviral, lipid-lowering, antihyperglycemic and protein inhibitory activities."", ""Antimicrobial agents"": ""Pyrazolone derivatives have been reported to show the significant antimicrobial activities against multiple types of bacteria and fungi. Generally, the antibacterial effect of pyrazolones is better than its antifungal effect, and the inhibitory activity on Gram positive (Gram \u00feve ) and Gram negative (Gram \u00c0ve ) strains was distinct as well.The bacterial cell membrane is generated with a dense wall comprising several peptidoglycan and teichoic acid layers [14e17]. In Gram \u00feve bacteria, the adsorption of the biocidal molecules is occurred on the lipoteichoic acid layer which is characterized by the charged nature and the ability to interact with the heteroatoms in the biocide molecules. While in the Gram \u00c0ve bacteria, the lipid layer is the target of the biocide molecules. The drug resistance of traditional antibiotics has aroused people's anxiety about superbacteria, and the attentions giving pyrazolones will pay a light in this field. "", ""Pyrazolones as antimicrobial agents and their SAR"": ""Nasser S. A. M. Khalil [18] described Schiff base compound 10 and its acetyl glucoside derivative 11 (Fig. 3 ) which exhibited the most potent inhibitory effect against the strains of Penicillium italicum, Syncephalastrum racemosum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli at the dose of 400 mg/mL. SAR could be deduced that the analogues with nonsubstituted on ring A exhibited the strongest activity and the acetyl glucoside group was more helpful to promote the inhibitory effect than N-glucoside. It was notable that the possible intramolecular H-bonding formed by the carbonyl group and the NH moiety improved the inhibition and the triad of permeability, solubility, and potency of the analogues were changed accordingly [19] .In 2007, Padmavathi and colleagues [20] synthesized multiple amino-pyrazolone, amino-isoxazolone and amino-pyrimidinone analogues, and evaluated their bioactivities. Thereinto, the amino-pyrazolone derivatives 12 and 13 (Fig. 3) showed the most pronounced antimicrobial activity (Table 1 ). SAR study elucidated that analogues with amino-hydroxypyrimidinone and N, N-dimethyliminopyrimidinedione showed weak inhibitory effect when compared with analogues modified with amino-pyrazolone and amino-isoxazolone groups. Additionally, benzyl sulfonyl analogues exhibited strongest inhibitory effect among the productions.Aly and co-workers [21] synthesized antipyrine derivatives 14, 15, 16 and 17 (Fig. 3 ) which were regarded as the prospective inhibitor (Table 1 ). SAR investigation expatiated that the presence of pyrazole and the introducing of effective moieties including eCOCH 3 , eCH 3 , -Cl and thiophene group on the scaffold of 4aminoantipyrine showed significant inhibitory effect.Hamama and teammates [22] described the antibacterial activity of several pyrazolone analogues, among which compound 18 ( Fig. 3 ) was the most hopeful candidate against E. coli and B. subtilis with the inhibition zoom diameter values of 40 and 36 mm respectively at the concentration of 100 ppm, which was approximately twofold to the reference drug ampicillin. The initiatory SAR can be considered as the introduction of piperidine group which was helpful to improve the antibacterial effect.Active antimicrobial compounds 19 and 20 produced by Rasapalli et al. [23] (Fig. 3 ) exhibited noticeable antibiofilm activity towards S. aureus strains ( Table 2) . Compound 19 suppressed biofilm formation of Staphylococcus epidermidis as well. SAR study suggested that the antibacterial scaffold can be acquired by condensation of the carbonyl compounds with the active methylene group on pyrazolone, and the 4-Cl and 2-Br substituted groups on A ring were proved to be the potential active modification for further development.Gadhave and colleagues [24] synthesized multi-fluorinated pyrazole-pyrazolone and chromone-pyrazolone compounds 21, 22, 23 and 24 ( Fig. 3 ) which exerted favorable antibacterial effects (Table 1) , whereas all the compounds exhibited poor antifungal activity profile. Regarding SAR, it can be speculated as that multifluorinated substitution was contributive to antibacterial while further modification was needed to improve the antifungal effect.Narayana Rao et al. [25] designed and synthesized several pyrazolone analogues 25, 26, 27 and 28 ( Fig. 3 ) with favorable activity ( Table 1) . As for SAR, the authors disclosed that the amino group on the A ring of pyrazolone markedly elevated the inhibitory effect compared with methyl, and the antimicrobial sequence of R group on the p-position of phenylhydrazine can be generally summarized as: Cl > Br > OMe > OC 2 H 5 .In 2017, Abdel Reheim and Baker [26] synthesized multiple pyrazolone derivatives and screened the antimicrobial activity, among which compound 29 exhibited strongest antibacterial and antifungal activities, and compound 30 (Fig. 3 ) showed significant antifungal effect (Table 1 ). The results of antimicrobial test can be concluded as that the introduction of active substitutions such as pyrano, pyridazine and pyrimidine can promote the antimicrobial activity of the pyrazolone nucleus to different degrees.Alkhaldi et al. [27] synthesized pyrazolone derivative 31 ( Fig. 3 ) with multiple antimicrobial effects (Table 1) . Concerning SAR, meta dichloro phenyl group on the benzene ring of the Schiff base was helpful to improve the antibacterial activity, and the subsequent molecular docking of the interactions of 31 within potential target glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase (Fig. 4) provided evidence for the antimicrobial effect of 31, the pyrazolone and the 2,4-dichlorophenyl moieties made the different binding models between 31 and glucosamine 6-phosphate, but the inhibitory potency is significant as well.Bhattacharjee and colleagues [28] presented pyrazolone compounds 32, 33, 34 and 35 (Fig. 3 ) which exhibited favorable inhibitory effect against Bacillus cereus with the MIC values of 0.78, 0.78, 0.78 and 0.39 mg/mL, respectively, and suppressed the growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae with the MIC values of 0.78, 0.39, 0.39 and 0.78 mg/mL, respectively. The preliminary SAR extracted from the results was that pyrazolone group was necessary to the antibacterial activity and the 3,4-dimethoxyl group on A ring was the potential effective substituent group.Another research reported that pyrazolone derivatives 36, 37 and 38 (Fig. 3) were potent compounds with anti-bacterial activity and anti-fungal activity exerted to different degree (Table 3 ) [29] . In regard to SAR, it was obvious that only compounds 36, 37 and 38 exhibited anti-fungal activity among the analogues, and in the antibacterial evaluation, 36, 37 and 38 were efficient inhibitor of S. mutans, S. typhi and B. subtilis, respectively. The 4-Br, 3-F-4-Br and 2,4-dinitro groups on the A ring were the potential active groups for further investigation.Sayed et al. [30] synthesized active pyrazolone/pyrazole derivatives 39 and 40 ( Fig. 3) with antimicrobial activity explored in Table 3 . With regard to SAR, compared with the inactive pyrazolone derivative which was non-substituted on the benzene ring, compound 39 exhibited moderate activity in the inhibition zone test. The pyrazole derivative 40 displayed the strongest inhibitory effect, indicating the potential modification method in the further investigation. The author held the point that the antimicrobial effect of the analogues seemed like their trend in the discrepancy in the polarity and the interaction of analogues by cellular membrane.Inspired from the structure of cholesterol, compounds 41, 42 and 43 (Fig. 3) were synthesized and investigated for their antimicrobial activities [31] . As shown in Table 1 (Table 1 ) [32] . SAR indicated that derivatives with pyrazole-1-carbothiohydrazide moiety exhibited higher inhibitory effect than derivatives containing pyrazolyl thiadiazine moiety. Additionally, the presence of free carbothiohydrazide unit enhanced the activity of compounds 44, 45 and 46 and the presence of electron-donating groups (EDGs) at the aromatic ring promoted the inhibitory effect of compound 44.Bihani and co-workers [33] synthesized zwitterionic pyrazolone analogues 47, 48, 49 and 50 ( Fig. 3) with the antimicrobial properties listed in Table 1 , the moderate inhibitory effects against Pseudomonas syringae and Proteus vulgaris were also reported. SAR can be inferred that electrophilic substituted groups on the C-3 or C-4 side of benzene ring could strengthen the activity.Oraby and teammates [34] synthesized 2,4-disubstituted phenylhydrazonopyrazolone and isoxazolone analogues as antibacterial agents. The results of antibacterial test suggested that the compounds contain the scaffold of pyrazolone like 51 and 52 ( Fig. 3 ) exhibited weak antibacterial effect against the multiple strains. Interestingly, the inhibitory activity was promoted simultaneously when the pyrazolone moiety was replaced to isoxazolone. Furthermore, docking study indicated that cation-p interactions between isoxazolone analogues and Arg 225, which was a residue played a crucial role in the stabilization of the cofactor during the catalysis in flavin adenine dinucleotide, increased the antibacterial effect of isoxazolones. The antibacterial effect of the analogues was influenced by the substitution on C-2 of the phenyl ring, the substitutions with electron withdrawing groups (EWGs) including F and Cl atoms selectivity increased the antibacterial effect against S. aureus compared to bulky moieties such like methyl."", ""Coordination pyrazolone compounds as antimicrobial agents"": ""Microorganisms acquire metals from the environment and use them for many essential cellular processes [35] . Metals are able to affect bacterial growth, vitality, and survival [36] , and effectively removing metals using metal chelators makes bacterial cells more susceptible to a variety of antibacterial agents, causing cell lysis and loss of viability. Chelators, including EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and metal complexes of chalcone and flavonoids [37, 38] , have attracting attentions in this field. Recently, many research groups made unremitting efforts to the synthesis and characterization of transition metal chelates of pyrazolones. Pyrazolones were likely to form several types of coordination compounds due to the several electron-rich donor centers [39] . Coordination compounds containing pyrazolone-based ligands are reported to be superior reagents in antimicrobial agents. In 2011, a research about Mn(III) mixed-ligand complexes with bis-pyrazolones and ciprofloxacin drug was published [40] , the antimicrobial outcome showed that when added into the strains of microorganisms (E. coli, Serratia marcescens, S. aureus and B. subtilis), the mixed-ligand complexes which contain the moiety of bis-pyrazolones and ciprofloxacin exhibited stronger inhibitory effect compared with bis-pyrazolones, in which compounds 53 and 54 ( Fig. 5) were the potential active antimicrobial agents. SAR can be suspected as that the chelation decreased the polarity of the central atom due to partial sharing of its positive charge with the donor moieties and possible electron delocalization over the whole chelation ring. The complex molecule promoted the hydrophobic character of the metal chelate and the liposolubility, hence favoring its permeation through the lipoid layer of the cell membrane of microorganism.Jadeja and co-workers [41] synthesized multiple pyrazolonebased complexes and evaluated the bioactivity. The consequence indicated that compound 55 (Fig. 5) showed stronger inhibitory effect against B. subtilis than other derivatives, at the dose of 3 mM, compound 55 suppressed the growth of B. subtilis strain with the diameter of inhibition zone of 25 mm.Schiff bases derivatives of pyrazolone intrigue attention of coordination chemists as versatile spacers due to their viable accessibilities and structural diversity. Joseph et al. [42] prepared two kinds of copper complexes derived from 4-formylpyrazolone (56 and 57, Fig. 5 ) and tested the antimicrobial activity against multiple strains. The result showed that both compounds 56 and 57 suppressed the growth of stains and the effect were quite comparable to the standard drugs including Levofloxacin and Moxifloxacin. 2,4dimethyl derivative 56 was more effective than 3,4-difluorol derivative 57.Lunagariya et al. [43] synthesized several organometallic platinum (II) analogues containing pyrazolone and determined their bioactivities. Among the analogues, compound 58 ( Nair and co-workers [44] prepared some metal complexes with derived from pyrazolone and evaluated their antimicrobial potent. The synthetic analogues exhibited antimicrobial effects to different degrees, among which compound 59 (Fig. 5 ) was the most promising one with the highest zones of inhibition i.e. 10.5, 14.3 and 11.2 mm measured in P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and E. coli. SAR research suggested that the metal chelates were more toxic than the parent ligands against the same microorganism and under identical experimental conditions. The biological activity of complexes followed the order of the change of metal ion: Ni (II) > Co (II) > Zn (II) > Cu (II) > Schiff base ligand."", ""Antitumor agents"": ""In the 21st century, malignant tumor is one of the leading causes of death and developing new antitumor agents with less drug resistance and side effects needs to be done as soon as possible [45] . In recent years, pyrazolone derivatives and their metal complexes have attracted the great attention of researchers for their potential antitumor activity and their less drug resistance and side effects [46] . So far, diverse pyrazolone analogues with antitumor potency have been reported."", ""VEGFR-2 target inhibitors. Vascular Endothelial Growth"": ""Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), also known as Flk-1, is mainly expressed in vascular endothelial cells and hematopoietic stem cells [47] . It is highly expressed in a variety of malignant tumors and plays a significant regulatory role in the metastasis and angiogenesis of tumor. Taking VEGFR-2 as the target, the search for VEGFR-2 inhibitors provides a good way to find some new anticancer drugs. Based on conserved active binding sites of VEGFR-2 and similar interaction conformation with ligands, several novel inhibitors of VEGFR-2 have been developed [48] , in which pyrazolones play important roles as well.In 2006, Tripathy and co-workers [49] synthesized a train of heterocyclic-substituted pyrazolones and tested inhibitory potency against VEGFR-2 kinase, among which compound 60 ( Fig. 6 ) was proved to be the most potential derivative inhibiting VEGFR2 kinase with the IC 50 value of 6 nM. SAR for the analogues can be summarized that replacement on the indole ring exhibited further potency increase against VEGFR-2 especially at the position of C-4 on the ring.Inspired from existing VEGFR-2 inhibitors, the same research group [50] modified the structure 61 by introducing a 4-benzyloxy substituent to generate compound 62. Further investigation on structural modifications of the aromatic moiety of 62 revealed that compound 63 (Fig. 6 ) was the most promising anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor (IC 50 : 5 nM). As for SAR, it was demonstrated that a plenty of halogen substituent groups on the aromatic ring were favored for ALK inhibitory potency. Moreover, the authors paid attention to the modification of the heterocyclic moiety and SAR analysis was concluded that compound bearing thiazole increased inhibition of ALK.Gu et al. [51] prepared a series of novel pyridine analogues bearing pyrazolone skeleton and evaluated the cell proliferation activities of synthetic analogues. Among all compounds, 64, 65 and 66 ( Fig. 6 ) exhibited favorable inhibitory potential on c-Met and VEGFR-2. The most promising analogue 66 significantly inhibited the targets c-Met (IC 50 : 0.11 mM) and VEGFR-2 (IC 50 : 0.19 mM) kinases in vitro. SAR analyses suggested that substitution of pyridine amine moiety with longer polar side chains or with hydrophilic group could improve inhibitory activity. "", ""c-Met target inhibitors."": ""Receptor tyrosine kinase c-mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c-Met), a vital target in antitumor therapy, plays a crucial role in the occurrence, development, metastasis and angiogenesis of tumors. In 2012, according to the theory of Structure-Based Drug Design, Norman and co-workers [52] designed and synthesized a series of class II c-Met inhibitors, among which derivative 67 ( Fig. 6 ) was confirmed to possess excellent potency against c-Met (Ki: 1.0 nM). This privilege compound was demonstrated to show binding affinity not only with c-Met (PDB ID: 3U6H) (Fig. 7A ), but also with VEGFR-2 kinase (PDB ID: 3U6J) ( Fig. 7B ) with the help of X-ray analysis of cocrystals. Obviously, the pyrazolone moiety plays crucial roles in occupying active sites of binding pocket, forming the pi-alkyl with Val 1155 in c-Met and H-bond with Asp 1046 in VEGFR-2 kinase, suggesting the broad prospect of pyrazolones developing as antitumor agents in the future. This study provides a new strategy for designing more selective analogues. Therefore, Liu et al. [53] synthesized a cluster of pyrazolone-based analogues according to compound 67 and screened the most selective class II c-Met inhibitor. Among them, compound 68 (Fig. 6 ) was the representative active antitumor agent. SAR investigation revealed that the 6-methoxy group of quinoline in the region (A), the pyridine in the central ring (B) and 2-hydroxypropyl side chain at N-1 could promote the selectivity and activity. In addition, the polar functionality at C-5 position of the pyrazolone was important for selectivity.A potential compound 69 (Fig. 6 ) was designed and synthesized by Zhou and colleagues [54] , inspired from the structure of abozantinib and foretinib as c-Met inhibitor (IC 50 : 2.20 nM) to show antiproliferative effect against multiple cancer cell lines, respectively. SAR investigation could be concluded that substitution of the cyclopropane-1,1-dicarboxamide framework of foretinib with the N-aryl-pyrazolone-4-imino and 2,4-imidazolinedione group sustained the potent antitumor activity. Additionally, analogues with mono/double-EDGs on the ring B were more active, especially eCF 3 at the C-2 position of ring B were more effective than eCH 3 or eOCH 3 groups.3.2.1.3. Other antitumor pyrazolone derivatives. Human SIRTs (Sirtuins) are relative to cell senescence, apoptosis, metabolism, proliferation and differentiation. In the past decade, they have emerged as targets for cancer chemotherapy. SIRT1, SIRT2 and SIRT3 are relatively important in the SIRTs family with extensive research. Mahajan and teammates [55] prepared a multiple of fivemembered ring pyrazolone analogues as Sirtuin inhibitors. Among these products, compounds 70 and 71 (Fig. 6) showed the inhibitory activities against SIRT1 with IC 50 values of 41 mM and 27 mM, respectively. In addition, compound 70 displayed the most promising inhibitory effect against SIRT3 (IC 50 : 6 mM). According to the pharmacophore investigations, SAR can be sum up as the presence of pyrazolone ring was important to improve the inhibitory effect on SIRT1 and SIRT3 through maintaining the balance of H-bond donor and acceptor moieties, from the active analogue 71, the introduction of bulky hydrophobic benzene group at the C-6 position of naphthalene was helpful to increase the activity on SIRT3. Moreover, the selective inhibition on SIRT2 was significantly elevated when the H-bond donor NH group on the position 1 was replaced as H-bond acceptor O.It's reported that pyrazolone was potential to be the starting point for generating RalA inhibitors, which were often activated in human cancer cell lines. Derivative 72 (Fig. 6) , as the most promising anticancer candidate, was designed and synthesized by Zhang and colleagues [56] . The consequence for ability of compound 72 inducing apoptotic death in PANC-1 cells showed that derivative 72 suppressed RalA according to inducing the accumulation of ROS and trigger mitochondrial apoptosis in PANC-1 cells.Markovic and colleagues [57] designed and synthesized compound 73 and its 5-phenylpyrazole derivative 74 (Fig. 6 ) which exhibited the most promising activity (Table 4 ). QSAR study revealed that geometrical and topological are the most momentous factors for effect of the analogues, for instance, the size and shape of the molecule. Containing planar benzene group at N-1 position of pyrazolone showed superior inhibitory potency on both cells tested for it was a more favorable conformation moiety when interacting with active sites. Herein, the inhibitory effect on the target mostly depended on fragment at the C-4 position through forming Hbonds with active place.Pyrazolone derivatives such as 4-aminoantipyrine are well known compound used widely prophylactic of some diseases including cancer. Ghorab and colleagues [58] synthesized a variety of pyrazolone derivatives 75e81 (Fig. 6 ) inspired from 4aminoantipyrine and determined the anticancer activity (Table 4) . SAR study can be summarized that the most potent compound belonged to the pyrimidine derivatives especially the halogen group.Dube and colleagues [59] synthesized a cluster of pyrazolone heterocyclic derivatives and evaluated their cytotoxic activities in vitro. The results of brine shrimp lethality assay showed that compound 82 displayed a favorable cytotoxic activity than standard cyclophosphamide. In addition, compounds 82 and 83 (Fig. 6 ) were found to be prominent analogues with the lethality concentration (LC 50 ) values being 10.8 mg/mL and 14.5 mg/mL in sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay, respectively. SAR investigation implied that the dimethoxy substitution on ring A increased the antitumor activities, the group of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity played a significant role in cytotoxic activities.Gouda et al. [60] prepared several pyrazole analogues and tested the cytotoxicity against the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells (EAC). To detail, the cytotoxicity data clearly displayed that and compounds (Table 5) . SAR can be recapitulated that introducing a hydrazopyrazol-5-one ring in position 2 to benzothiophene was important to the cytotoxic activity, furthermore, the order of antitumor activities of compound follows 86 < 87 < 88 and 84 < 89 < 90 (Fig. 6) , it can be speculated that the group of COOEt at position 3 of the thiophene ring system in compounds increased the antitumor activity."", ""Coordination pyrazolone compounds as antitumor agents"": ""In 2013, Vyas and colleagues [61] synthesized the new pyrazolone based complex 91 (Fig. 8) for the first time, which was suggested to be a potent antitumor agent against lung cancer cell lines (A549). According to evaluation of the cytotoxic activities against A549 cell lines and noncancerous rat cardiomyocytes (H9C2) cell lines in vitro, the result displayed that compound 92 (Fig. 8) Three kinds of pyrazolone complexes 94e96 (Fig. 8 ) were synthesized by Bakr and co-workers [63] . The MTT assay outcomes implied that HL exhibited the better cytotoxic activity against HePG2 and PC3 cell lines than 5-Fluorouracil with IC 50 values being 5.69 and 6.80 mg/mL, respectively (Table 6) . For metal complexes, the order of cytotoxicity was found to be 95 > 94 > 96.Zhang and colleagues [64] synthesized two new transition metal complexes with 4-acylpyrazolone derivative as potential antitumor agents. According to the results of antitumor determination, the complex 97 ( Fig. 8 ) was proved to exhibit higher cytotoxicity activity with IC 50 values being 1.9 mg/mL for human esophageal cancer cells (Eca-109) and 1.2 mg/mL for cervical cancer cells (HeLa). The study suggested that the complex 97 might be an effective agent for tumor."", ""CNS agents"": ""Because of the intricate pathogenesis and devastating effects, CNS disease is still a challenge for researchers to find novel precursors as the therapy [65] . In view of the experiment of the development of edaravone, several pyrazolones have been taken into account to be the CNS agents, existing literatures mainly focus on the anticonvulsant, antidepressant, anti-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, anti-Alzheimer's activities and inhibitory effect against other CNS related targets. Herein, we summarized the bioactivity and SAR for the synthetic derivatives, wishing to give evidence for pyrazolones to develop as CNS clinical agents."", ""Anticonvulsant agents"": ""Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder syndrome identified by the spontaneous recurrence of seizures which can disrupt periods of more or less normal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and behavior [66] . Currently the anticonvulsant drugs are chiefly derived from benzodiazepines or GABA (g-aminobutyric acid) analogues, pyrazolone derivatives are likely to provide a novel orientation for drug design. Eldebss et al. [67] synthesized pyrazolone-based heterocycle compounds as monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors and evaluated the tryptamine seizure potentiation in rats. The results manifested that compounds 97 and 98 ( Fig. 9) were the most promising candidates (Table 7) .Viveka et al. [68] prepared pyrazolone analogues 99 and 100 ( Fig. 9) with favorable anticonvulsant activities. In the maximal electroshock (MES) test, compound 99 performed the best protective potency with the protection ratio of 79.76% and no significant toxicity was determined at the dosage of 25 mg/kg, while in the analgesic test it showed weak effect. Compound 100 exhibited moderate protection on the reaction time of mice. SAR study demonstrated that the existing of pyrazolone moiety elevates the anticonvulsant potency. As for the analgesic effect di-Cl substituent group on the heterocyclic systems promoted the activity, whereas slightly less activity was determined for the analogues with di-F substituents.A cluster of pyrazolone analogues were synthesized and assessed for the anticonvulsant and antidepressant activities by Abdel-Aziz and colleagues [69] . Compounds 101, 102 and 103 ( Fig. 9 ) displayed the most potent protective potency against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced clonic seizures in mice at a dosage level of 20 mg/kg with the protective ratio for 74.5, 78.7 and 74%, respectively, which was close to phenobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg) and better than phenytoin sodium (30 mg/kg). Preliminary SAR study can be concluded that the existence of cricoid pyrazolone group increased the anticonvulsant effect compared with the linear chain-hydrazide analogues, and thiophene acyl moiety was the most potent substituted group, while linear chain-hydrazide analogues performed better than pyrazolones in the antidepressant determination."", ""Antidepressant agents"": ""Merugumolu and co-workers [70] prepared multiple pyrazolone derivatives and estimated the anti-depressant effect in vivo. The consequence demonstrated that the most promising derivatives 104 and 105 (Fig. 9 ) possessed remarkable antidepressant activity in forced swimming test and tail suspension test (Table 8) , with the relative values in the same magnitude of imipramine. As for SAR, the substituted groups on the 3,4-position of the ring of aromatic hydrazine exhibited better activity than other substituted groups."", ""Anti-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis agents"": ""The pyrazolone skeleton is an effective group characterized in a cell-based high throughput screening assay targeting mutant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) induced toxicity and aggregation as a marker for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is an orphan neurodegenerative disease so for without a cure with the incidence of 1e2 per 100000 per year and 2e5 years from diagnosis to death [71, 72] .A cluster of pyrazolone analogues were screened and evaluated for the anti-ALS activity from FDA approved drugs and biochemical reagents by Radhia and co-workers [73] , as the most potent skeleton, the arylsulfanyl pyrazolones showed 100% efficacy compared with the positive control, radicicol (80% efficacy) in the test of G93A-SOD1 expression in PC12 cells model. CMB-003299 (106, Fig. 9 ) was the typical compound to decrease the mutant SOD1 aggregation with the ED 50 value of 400 nM, and the weak cytotoxic effect was detected with the LD 50 > 100 mM.In the sequent research, a series of ether analogues with more metabolically stability were synthesized [74] . The most effective derivative 107 (CMB-087229) (Fig. 9) showed superior potency and in vitro pharmacological and pharmacokinetic features including protection against the mutant SOD1-induced cytotoxicity (ED 50 : 67 nM), good performance in the evaluation of potassium channel (10 mM), protection of primary cortical neurons, Caco-2 permeability, rat liver microsomes and cytochrome P450 isozymes. Moreover, in vivo for its efficacy in an ALS mouse model, pharmacokinetic profile and brain penetration were investigated as well, compound 107 (1.0, 10, and 20 mg/kg) dose-dependently extended the survival of SOD1 G93A mice at the dose of 300 mg/kg. In addition, compound 107 exhibited favorable blood-brain barrier penetration effect. SAR research revealed that the size and electronics were imperative features at the meta-positions of the derivatives, the potency of analogues reduced in the sequence: Cl > CF 3 > F > Br > Ph."", ""Anti-Alzheimer's agents"": ""Based on the structure of leading compound edaravone, Tok and co-workers [75] synthesized a cluster of analogues and investigated the potential anti-Alzheimer activity. Among the analogues, compounds 108 and 109 (Fig. 9 ) exerted most potent inhibitory effects, with the detail data listed in Table 9 . For the instance of the most potent AChE inhibiting agent 108 and MAO-B inhibiting agent 109, the initial SAR could be summarized as that the variation of substituent groups strongly affected the inhibitory potency of analogues. Basic nitrogen atom in substituent groups of 108 significantly promoted the AChE inhibitory activity. In addition, incorporation of EWG increased the MAO-B inhibitory activity of 109. It can be seen from the docking analysis that compound 108 was prepared with similar size with donepezil (Fig. 10) , and the room of cyclopentanone ring can be occupied by pyrazolone ring, providing the evidence of the activity and the idea to capture Alzheimer disease."", ""Other CNS target agents"": ""A major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain is GABA that delivers primarily through the GABA A receptors [76] . GABA A receptors are considered to be heteropentameric transmembrane glycoprotein spanning both extracellular and intracellular regions [77] . Inspired from the pyrazolone-based precursors 110e112 (Fig. 9 ), Hintermann and co-workers [78] synthesized several analogues as the ligands for the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA A receptor. Among them, compound 113 ( Fig. 9 ) was the typical compound with the affinity of IC 50 values of a1 GABA A receptor, a2 GABA A receptor, a1 GABA A BZ receptor, a2 GABA A BZ receptor for 49, 271, 46 and 271 nM, respectively, however, the weak activity of compound 113 was observed in anxiety models in vivo, which was suspected due to the high level of clearance (in vitro: CL int rat: 128.3 mL/min * mg). SAR study suggested that the 2-Cl-benzyl substituent group was initially maintained for the purpose to investigate the influence of core modifications, variations of substituent groups on the aromatic pyrazolone moiety leading to the mixed results. The corresponding analogues were very weak agonists at a2 and some behaved as antagonists at a1. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), a regulator of glycogen metabolism, has been well known to be involved in a variety of intracellular signaling, and a lot of GSK-3 inhibitors has been used for the treatment of CNS disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD) [79] , Parkinson's disease [80] , stroke, traumatic brain injury, and bipolar disorders [81] . Pyrazolone derivatives were chronicled to show activity on this target as well [82] , the most promising compound 114 (Fig. 9 ) inhibited GSK-3 with IC 50 value of 34 nM. Further investigation demonstrated that this compound possessed good kinase selectivity, and protective effects in oxidative stress mode in neuronal cell and locomotor hyperactivity in C57BL/6J mice were observed. SAR investigation indicated that nonsubstitution on the A ring was advantageous for the activity because only compound 114 exhibited the pronounced inhibitory effect among the synthetic compounds. Interestingly, the known GSK-3 inhibitors i.e. bisindol-maleimides (115) [83] and hymenialdisine (116) [84] (Fig. 9) contain the moieties structurally similar to the pyrazolone scaffold, which indicated the reasonability of using pyrazolone for the design of the GSK-3 inhibitor. According to the structure of (S)-a-aminoadipic acid, which was an activating agent of important functional excitatory amino acid receptor mGlu2 and mGlu6 subtypes, compounds 117 and 118 ( Fig. 9) were synthesized by Zimmermann et al. [85] thought some reactions. However, no significant agonist or antagonist activity from test compounds at the mGlu 1a , mGlu 2 , mGlu 4a , or mGlu 6 subtypes were observed at the dose of 1 mM, the inappropriate pK a of analogues was considered as the potential reason of obstruct interaction of substituted groups with appropriate sites at the receptors."", ""Anti-inflammatory agents"": ""More than 100 years of synthetic work have resulted in three privileged pyrazolones derivatives with anti-inflammatory potency, namely antipyrine, propyphenazone and metamizole which are still widely used [86] . The structure characteristic that methyl groups attach to the ring nitrogen atoms to enhance the activity has been retained from antipyrine to newly reported analogues. Based on the structure of marketed anti-inflammatory drugs including antipyrine and aminophenazone, several pyrazolone derivatives have been designed and synthesized as anti-inflammatory agents.With the thorough understand of inflammatory reactions, using single mice or rat model to evaluate the analgesic effect gradually fall short of demand to investigate the activity, more and more targets are involved into the determination including COX-1, COX-2, 5-LOX, TNF-a, etc. Pyrazolones with anti-inflammatory effects tend to inhibited the activities of COXs and LOXs, which catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins or leukotrienes, meanwhile, phosphatase inhibitory of pyrazolones have also been disclosed [87] , indicating the potential of pyrazolone motif in this field. The structural similarity between pyrazolone and COX-2 selective inhibitor celecoxib also provides possibility to develop them into potential clinical candidates [88e91]. The gastrointestinal side effects existing in the usage of COX-1 inhibitors and the cardiovascular side effects in COX-2 inhibitors suggest researchers to consider the inhibitory potency of anti-inflammatory agents on both COX-1 and COX-2, the story of the development of imrecoxib and the conception of moderate selectivity for COX-2 enzyme have been reported as references [19] . It can be seen from the binding affinity models of celecoxib and pyrazolone derivative 131 with COX-1 and COX-2 ( Fig. 12 ) that pyrazolone group maintain the similar pi-alkyl effect with electron group of alkyl groups in the pocket residues compared to pyrrazole ring because of its property similar to aromatic ring. The carbonyl group in pyrrazole is a favorable hydrogen acceptor which is feasible to form potential Hbond with alkaline amino acids like arginine, lysine and histidine, meanwhile, the amino group is a hydrogen donor easy to form hydrogen bond with residues like glutamine (Fig. 12D) .A cluster of pyrazolone and amino pyrimidine derivatives 119e124 (Fig. 11) were synthesized by Antre and co-workers [92] , with obvious anti-inflammatory potency in carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model (Table 10 ). In regard to SAR, in contrast to the substitution of chlorine and nitro, the anti-inflammatory effects of these analogues were significantly promoted when the electrondonating groups of C-6 aminopyrimidine benzene ring were hydroxyl, methoxy and dimethylamine. Nadia and colleagues [93] synthesized multiple pyrazolonepyridazine conjugates and screened their anti-inflammatory activity in vivo and in vitro. Compound 125 (Fig. 11 ) exhibited the strongest anti-inflammatory activity in the test of carrageenaninduced mice paw edema model and in COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition test (Table 10) . It also inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-a and IL-6 in serum. SAR study showed that the replacement with bulky aliphatic secondary amines such as morpholine exerted good anti-inflammatory effects.Mannich base derivatives 126 and 127 (0.03 mmol/kg) (Fig. 11 ) displayed the remarkable anti-inflammatory effect on the carrageenan-induced acute albino rats paw edema model with inhibitory rates of 77.88% and 79.91%, respectively, after 6 h of administration [94] . The preliminary SAR demonstrated that analogues containing EWGs in the Mannich base phenyl ring at position 4, especially sulfonic group enhanced the activity.Abbady and co-workers synthesized some new pyridines, pyrans, and indazoles with pyrazolone ring [95] . Among the synthetic products, indazole derivatives 128 and 129 (10 mg/kg) (Fig. 11 ) obviously suppressed swelling of in rat hind paws induced 5 h after injection of carrageenan, with inflammatory inhibition rates of 56.20% and 55.20%, respectively, indicating excellent antiinflammatory activity.A series of 5-methyl-2-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-3 (2H)-one analogues were prepared and determined for their anti-inflammatory effects [96] . The outcome showed that the derivatives 130 and 131 (Fig. 11 ) were proved to have superior inhibitory potency against both the targets of inflammation COX-1 and COX-2 (Table 10) . Furthermore, derivatives 130 and 131 also exhibited favorable antiinflammatory effect in carrageenan induced rats paw edema model with ED 50 values of 102 and 109 mg/kg in vivo, respectively. Regarding SAR, pyrazolones containing C-3 methyl group, C-4 urea substitution and carbonyl at 5-position posed an impact on COX enzymes inhibition. The substituent with urea-phenyl group at 3phenyl ring was more active than that containing chlorine at the same position and unsubstituted urea. Moreover, thiourea derivatives imparted strengthen activity compared with those with urea and guanidine. Ashraf et al. [97] successfully prepared two series of pyrazolone analogues and tested their anti-inflammatory effect in vivo and in vitro. The derivative 132 and the enolate133 (Fig. 11 ) displayed excellent inhibitory activity on COX-2 (Table 10 ) as well as potent edema inhibition. SAR investigation showed that these compounds with unsaturated moiety such as the allyl and aryl groups maintained stronger activities than those with alkyl groups. Thiourea analogues 132 also improved anti-inflammatory potency in the presence of the bulky hydrophobic cyclohexyl group.El Sayed and colleagues designed and synthesized novel heterocyclic derivatives containing antipyrine and pyrazolone framework [98] . The pharmacology tests result revealed that derivatives 134e136 (Fig. 11 ) exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activities in different degree both in vivo and in vitro ( Table 10 ). The SAR study indicated that the presence of the 3-benzo[d] [1, 3] dioxole ring system and the N-containing heterocyclic amine attached to the methyl group at 4-position of the antipyrine structure was very essential for activity as in case of compounds 134 and 135.A cluster of novel pyrazolone analogues containing aminosulfonyl group were synthesized and investigated for the anti-inflammatory potency [99] . The outcome showed that three compounds 137e139 (Fig. 11) , as potent anti-inflammatory agents, exerted strong inhibitory effects against both COX-2 (Table 10) Fahmy et al. [100] tested anti-inflammatory effects of several novel O-substituted salicylamides. Among all analogues, pyrazolone derivative 141 (Fig. 11 ) exhibited moderate antiinflammatory activity in carrageenan-induced edema model. The multiple bioactivity test results indicated the pyrazolone and the structurally similar group pyrazole could be the potential substitutions.Golebiowski and co-workers synthesized some novel monocyclic pyrazolone and investigated their inhibition on the inflammatory cytokines [101] . The outcome showed that compound 142 (Fig. 11 ) significantly reduced the expression of TNF-a induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with IC 50 value of 13 nM. Furthermore, through SAR study, it can be found that benzyl amino substituents were more active than those of aminopyridine ring, and N-methyl substitution on the pyrazolone was more effective than ethyl substitution. Currently, the topic of inflammatory reaction has beyond the analgesic agents, immunoreactivity targets also involved. The author observed the interactions of p38 kinase with another potential synthesized pyrazolone derivative 143 (Fig. 13) , in which the piperidine ring was introduced to gain the better pharmacokinetic parameters. The carbonyl group of pyrazolone ring was proved to form the H-bond with the amine group of Lys 53, revealing the importance of pyrazolone moiety of this type of inhibitor."", ""Antioxidant agents"": ""Free radicals, known to be highly reactive molecules resulted via different biochemical reactions in the body. These free radicals lead the other metabolites to be oxidized and caused different diseases due to oxidative stress [102] . Pyrazolones played a role in antioxidant activity, referring to the antioxidant mechanism of edaravone, C]C double bond formed by the action of tautomerism of carbonyl group on pyrazolone was considered to be important [103] . In the light of the structure motif of 4-aminoantipyrine, Schiff base derivative 144 (Fig. 14) was prepared and determined for the antioxidant activity [104] . The derivative 144 exerted a strong antioxidant effect with IC 50 value of 31.26 mM. As a non-phenolic antioxidant agent, the antioxidant effect of compound 144 was considered to be relative to the formation of proton free radicals by the C-7 or C-11 methyl groups. The Schiff base pyrazolone analogues were also synthesized by Khan et al. [105] , among the products, phenol productions 145e148 (Fig. 14) exhibited significant antioxidant effect in DPPH test with the IC 50 values of 20.14, 19.12, 17.14, 15.16 mM, respectively, which was even stronger than the standard drug n-propyl gallate (IC 50 : 30.27 mM). SAR study revealed that double phenol group substituted analogues performed better than other moieties because of the reducibility of phenolic hydroxyl group, and 2.5-diOH substitution was stronger than 2,4-diOH.Gaffer and co-workers [106] screened the antioxidant activity of a cluster of thiazolyl-pyrazolone derivatives through 2, 2 0 -azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical cation decolorization assay. Compounds 149 and 150 (Fig. 14) (2 mM) exhibited the strongest antioxidant potency with the inhibition of 88.6% and 85.7%, respectively. Thereinto, compound 149 exhibited better activity than standard inhibitor ascorbic acid (inhibition: 88.20%). SAR investigation was concluded as that the presence of benzene on the thiazole ring and phenylthiocarbamoyl moiety along with core pyrazolone group was benefit to the antioxidant effect. Additionally, 4-phenyl substituent group on the thiazole ring was better than the methyl substitution."", ""Anti-tuberculosis agents"": ""Tuberculosis (TB) is an airborne infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and embodies one of the leading causes of death around the world [107] . The dangerous spread of TB is primarily because of its association with HIV infection and to the rapid development of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of MTB [108] . Pyrazolone as the precursor has been reported to show potential antitubercular activity.Sivakumar et al. [109] prepared two series of hybridized pyrazolone analogues and determined their antitubercular effect. The most potent compounds 151 and 152 (Fig. 15 ) possessed apparent antitubercular effects (IC 50 < 0.1 mg/mL). Furthermore, SAR investigation indicated that the antitubercular activity of the compounds was markedly improved in the absence of double bond in the imine side chain and the benzene ring at the end of pyrazolone moiety.Pethaiah et al. [110] synthesized several 2-aryl-5-methyl-2,3dihydro-1H-3-pyrazolone analogues in water through one-pot process and investigated the antitubercular activity against MTB in vitro. The MIC value of potential compound 153 (Table 11 ) (Fig. 15 ) was better than clinical drugs. SAR showed that the replacement on the N-aryl ring of derivatives contributed antimycobacterial activity. Specifically, the analogues containing electron-withdrawing groups with halogens and nitro groups showed stronger activity compare with aryl rings containing electron-donating groups such as methoxide, methyl and isopropyl.Daniele et al. [111] prepared various pyrazole analogues and evaluated their antitubercular activities against M. tuberculosis. Compound 154 (Fig. 15 ) was the most potent candidate (Table 11 ). SAR study demonstrated that the halogens on phenyl ring and the methyl group at third position of pyrazole ring showed higher antitubercular effect than that contained alkyl in the same position.Two series of new pyrazolone analogues were prepared and assessed for the anti-MTB activity [112] . Two analogues 155 and 156 (Fig. 15 ), containing the p-chlorophenyl ring, were regarded as the most promising MTB inhibitors (Table 11) . Meanwhile, the presence of N-methyl-piperazine and morpholine groups remarkedly improved anti-MTB effects.Several Mannich bases and Schiff bases of pyrazolone framework were synthesized [113] . The results showed that analogue 157 (Fig. 15 ) could be used as a potential antitubercular drug due to its extremely high activity (Table 11 ) over that of the standards ethambutol and ciprofloxacin. SAR study revealed that derivatives with acyl substituent had better anti-MTB ability than those comprising EWGs such as nitro, chlorine, and carboxyl and electron donating group including hydroxyl.Ahsan and co-workers [114] designed some diversified pyrazolone derivatives aiming at MTB and isoniazid resistant MTB, among which compounds 158 and 159 (Fig. 15 ) exhibited pronounced inhibitory effect (Table 11) , the outstanding inhibitory effect of 159 against isoniazid resistant MTB strain was observed as well and the compound 158 was revealed to show strong antibacterial effect simultaneously. SAR study revealed that N-aryl with electronegative substituent group showed strongest antitubercular potency, in which 4-pyridinyl group had maximum inhibition, compared to 2-chlorophenyl, 4-chlorophenyl and 4-aminophenyl group substitution. The electron donating group such as 4- methoxyphenyl, 2-methylphenyl, 3-methylphenyl and 4methylphenyl exhibited less inhibition. In the follow up research [115] , the potent compound 160 (Fig. 15 ) was selected from the novel synthesized analogues with excellent activity and free from cytotoxicity (>62.5 mg/mL) appeared. Better drug-likeness was obtained after adding the imine group between the oxadiazol and the phenyl ring and SAR was summarized as that EWGs produced more inhibitory effect."", ""Antiviral agents"": ""Multiple viruses widely exist in the nature and threaten public health [116] . Pyrazolone has been used to generate antiviral agents, involving in anti-orthopoxvirus, anti-protease-resistant prion protein (PrP-res), anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and anti-buffalopox virus (BPXV) agents.Fan et al. [117] synthesized a series of pyrimidine-pyrazolone nucleoside chimera analogues and determined the antiorthopoxvirus activity in vitro. The consequence proved that compounds 161 and 162 (Fig. 16 ) exerted the most potent antiorthopoxvirus effect (Table 12 ). SAR study revealed that the activity was enhanced after matching with the pyrazolone moiety.In 2007, Kimata and co-workers [118] reported the synthesis and assessment of multiple PrP-res accumulation inhibitors according to the structure of edaravone, in which the most potent compound 163 (Fig. 16 ) displayed PrP-res inhibitory effect in the ScN2a cells with IC 50 value of 3 nM, which was 130 times more active than quinacrine and more than 300-fold effective than edaravone. Furthermore, no significant SOD (superoxide dismutase)-like activity was observed, indicating potential novel mechanism of the PrP-res inhibitory effect. SAR study demonstrated that the position and class of substitutions were not directly related to the potency of suppressing the accumulation of PrP-res but substituted the nucleus with 1-cyclohexyl, 3-isopropenyl, 3-(4-nitrophenyl) and 4-benzoyl could enhance the inhibitory activity.Srinivasan and teammates [119] synthesized several spiropiperidinyl pyrazolone derivatives inspired from the skeleton of . 16) were the most potent analogues with electron donating groups on the aromatic ring. Kumar and coworkers [120] synthesized multiple pyrazolone analogues as SARS-coronavirus (CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV 3C-like protease inhibitors, among which compounds 167 and 168 (Fig. 16 ) exerted the strongest inhibitory effects against SARS and MERS with IC 50 values of 6.4 and 5.8 mM (167), 5.8 and 7.4 mM (168), respectively. SAR study revealed that the carboxylate group is a crucial pharmacophore and its presence either at the C-2 position of ring A or moiety B is critical for the activity, meanwhile, the chlorine at C-5 position of ring A slightly decreases the activity. It can be seen from the docking studies that pyrazolone group in both compounds 167 and 168 played important roles to form H-bonds with residues Glu 166 and His 41 in SARS 3CL pro , respectively."", ""Lipid-lowering agents"": ""With the change of people's lifestyle and dietary structure, the incidence of fatty liver is increasingly high. In particular, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has seriously endangered people's life and health [121] . However, due to the complex pathogenesis [122] , it is often neglected in clinical practice. Pyrazolinone derivatives can reduce cholesterol and lipid accumulation in the body by regulating multiple indicators, such as AMPK and FXR. Therefore, it is of importance to improve the lipidlowering activity by modifying the structure of pyrazolone. The pyrazolone derivatives are also reported to be the selective antagonists to the nonsteroidal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) [123] , which maintains the bile acid homeostasis and plays crucial roles in the control of cholesterol, lipid, and glucose metabolism [124, 125] . Based on the screen of the known FXR modulators, the lead compound 169 (Fig. 17 ) (IC 50 : 69.01 mM) was identified with the help of homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay. On the basis of 169, further modification was carried out accordingly. The most promising compound 170 (IC 50 : 8.96 mM) displayed antagonistic capability 10-fold and 8-fold higher than that of the control Zguggulsterone and the original analogue 169, respectively. Compound 170 was further proved to interact with FXRaLBD with high binding affinity, and potent antagonistic activity against FXR in two cell testing platforms. In addition, compound 170 strongly inhibited the regulating activities of chenodeoxycholic acid on FXR target genes. Furthermore, compound 170 was proved to play a role in lowering the contents of triglyceride and cholesterol in human hepatoma HepG2 cells and in the cholesterol-fed C57BL/6 mice. SAR can be interpreted that changes of substituents on the 1, 3, and 4-positions of pyrazolone group had crucial influence on antagonistic effect, and appropriate structural optimizations on the above regions can substantially strengthen activity. NAFLD is a clinical syndrome identified by hepatic steatosis. It is closely linked to obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK) functions as an energy sensor and plays an important role in regulating lipid metabolism [126, 127] . According to the structure of lead compound 171 (Fig. 17) , Zhang et al. [128] synthesized multiple pyrazolone derivatives as AMPK activators to suppress lipid synthesis and reduce lipid accumulation in ob/ob mice. The most potent compound 172 directly activated the kinase domain of AMPK with an EC 50 value of 2.1e0.2 mmol/L and acted as a non-selective activator of AMPK complexes, additionally, compound 172 suppressed the accumulation of triglyceride in HepG2 cells dose-dependently. The outcome demonstrated that the AMPK activators could be part of a treating method for NAFLD and related metabolic disorders."", ""Antihyperglycemic agents"": ""Diabetes is considered to be relative to overindulgent life-style and thus is thought as major health concern in industrialized countries [129] . Pyrazolones have been disclosed to be antihyperglycemic through multiple targets including aldose reductase (AR), a-glucosidase and a-amylase. The antihyperglycemic activity of pyrazolone derivatives was explored by Kees et al. [130] The potent compound 173 (100 mg/kg) (Fig. 18 ) caused a 68% decrease in plasma glucose in db/db mice, moreover, it essentially normalized the level of glucose at 20 mg/kg (57% reduction) and maintained remarkable reduction at 2 mg/kg (30% decrease). SAR could be concluded that the substitution of 4-methylthio, methylsulfinyl, or ethyl to a benzyl group at C-4, in combination with trifluoromethyl at C-4 position of pyrazolone (hydroxy tautomer) formed potent antihyperglycemic agents in mice. In addition, the chemical \""trapping\"" of four of the seven possible tautomeric forms of the heterocycle by mono-and dialkylation at the acidic hydrogens gave several additional potent analogues.Kadam and co-workers [129] synthesized several pyrazolone derivatives as inhibitors of AR, in which compound 174 (Fig. 18) displayed the most promising inhibitory with IC 50 value of 6.30 mM.In regard to SAR, it was possible to note that the hydrophobic groups like benzene ring with pyrazolone adversely influenced AR inhibition, while the introduction of carbothioamide group increased inhibitory effect. Because of the simultaneous existing of arbothioamide moiety and 3-(4I-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenyl-1Hpyrazole and 3-(4I-chlorophenyl)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazole substituent group at first position of pyrazolone, compound 174 exerted the best activity. Docking analysis suggested that substituted groups of 174 gave the proper placement of hydrophobic groups in respective binding pockets of AR, avoiding the poor interactions because the size of substitutions was too small to occupy the binding pocket, and the pyrazolone moiety in compound 174 was considered to play a role in form H-bond with the residue Cys 298.Eldebss and colleagues [131] prepared a series of pyrazolones acting as a-glucosidase and a-amylase inhibitors, among which compound 175 (Fig. 18) compound 176 (Fig. 18 ) displayed the strongest inhibitory effect with the ratio of 61.6%. The primary SAR can be suspected as that introduction of disubstituted halogen analogues promoted the inhibitory effect due to its high electronegativity, moreover, multifluoro substitution on A ring could be the potential active group."", ""Protein inhibitors"": ""In addition to the activities mentioned above, pyrazolones have been shown to inhibit the proteins including K ATP channel protein, phosphodiesterase (PDE), aromatase, divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), human carboxylesterase1 (hCE1) and transforming growth factor (TGF) bR1, indicating the multiple targets therapeutic action and favorable drug-likeness of pyrazolone derivatives. Drizin and co-workers [133] designed and synthesized a cluster of pyrazolone derivatives as K ATP channel openers inspired from disclosed compounds (the skeleton of 177 and 178, Fig. 19 ), together with the investigation of SAR. It can be concluded that cyclopentanone in the left hand portion (A area) of the derivative was 4fold more potent than cyclohexanone. The introduction of gemdimethyl groups as well as incorporation of oxygen in the cyclohexanone ring in the left hand portion of the molecule elevated the potency 10-fold. In the right hand portion of the molecule, the activity was promoted 5-fold when the NH-group on the pyrazolone was replaced by oxygen atom.Ochiai et al. [87] synthesized several 4,4-dimethylpyrazolone analogues as cyclic 30,50-nucleotide PDE 3/4-inhibitor, in which the compound 179 (Fig. 19 ) was demonstrated to be the most potent compound inhibiting PDE 3A and PDE 4B with the IC 50 values of 0.14 and 0.15 mM, respectively. In addition, significant bronchodilatory activity was observed. SAR study demonstrated that the presence of pyrazolopyridine 7-substituent can engender potency for the inhibition of PDE 4, and the isosteric imidazopyridine substitution made for the pyrazolopyridine subunit increases the well-balanced dual of PDE 3 and PDE 4. As a member of PDEs, Trypanosoma brucei PDB1 (TbrPDEB1) was described as a crucial target for the therapy of Human African trypanosomiasis [134, 135] , which was a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan pathogen T. brucei. Orrling and colleagues [136] explored catechol pyrazolinones as trypanocidals inspired from the structural motif rolipram. After the scaffold merging, the premier potent compound 180 (Fig. 19) was selected with the TbrPDEB1 IC 50 value of 12 mM. Furthermore, with the help of homology modeling and docking studies to guide fragment growing into the parasite-specific Ppocket, which was a unique sub-pocket that extended from the invariant glutamine (Gln 874) through the protein to the solvent in the enzyme binding site, the fragment growing compound 181 (Fig. 19) was emerged with the outstanding activities for inhibiting T. brucei rhodesiense with IC 50 value of 60 nM and TbrPDEB1 with IC 50 value of 49 nM. SAR investigation elucidated that pyrazolone held a conjugated p-system and additional possibility to interact with aromatic residues in the binding pocket of TbrPDEB1. Moreover, the extended alkyl chain in the analogues of 181 enabled to reach and enter the P-pocket, which displaced water from the length of the P-pocket and placed the tetrazole at the solventexposed exit of the pore. The tetrazole in compound 181 formed a H-bond with Tyr 845, further stabilizing the conformation. Afterwards, according to the structure of 180 and 181, Amata and coworkers [137] designed and synthesized a cluster of derivatives, while poor inhibitory effect was detected, the most promising pyrazolone compound 182 (Fig. 19 ) only showed inhibition for 18% at the dose of 10 mM, indicating a better understanding of the subtle structural features was necessary for an optimal enzyme inhibition.Yi and co-workers [138] synthesized the diversified pyrazolone derivatives and screened the aromatase inhibition effect. The most active compounds were 183 and 184 (Fig. 19) , showing IC 50 values of 2.3 nM and 3.3 nM, respectively. The inhibition of compound 183 was even stronger than the reference letrozole (IC 50 : 2.8 nM). SAR analysis indicated that the pyrazolone moiety could inhibit aromatase by binding to its active site. The bioactivity result proved that the presence of substitutions in compounds 183 and 184 were good for the inhibition, as for the most promising compound 183, the cyano group was revealed to interact with the important residues Arg 115 and Met 374 of the aromatase.From the high-throughput screening of DMT1 [139] , pyrazolone hit 185 (IC 50 : 2.57 mM, Fig. 19 ) was elaborated as the structural motif. Preliminary hit-to-lead efforts gave the pyridyl analogue 186 (IC 50 : 1.53 mM), which imparted several undesirable features including most notably an extended conjugation motif affording an intense orange color as well as Michael acceptor features at the benzylidene a-carbon. Further investigation introduced more substitutions to modify these skeletons, and the most promising compound 187 (IC 50 : 0.64 mM) was distinguished because of its eminent absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties, the inhibition of CYP3A4 was significantly reduced and the rat microsome metabolic stability was markedly hoisted compared to the precursor 186. SAR of the analogues of 187 implied that EWGs on the benzene ring were slightly preferred over electron-donating ones. Based on the existing TGFbR1 inhibitors, Guckian and colleagues [140] described a series of TGFbR1 kinase inhibitors including a pyrazolone group which allowed replacement of the ubiquitous nitrogen H-bond acceptor within the core with a carbonyl without remarkable loss in biochemical activity. The most active compound 188 (Fig. 19 ) inhibited the TGFbR1 kinase with the Ki value of 0.012 mM and suppressed the PAI-Luc with the IC 50 value of 0.22 mM. SAR can be recapitulated that the carbonyl moiety of pyrazolone was potent to capture the H-bonding interaction with the key residue Lys 232 of TGFbR1. The A ring was the area the authors paid attention to modify, and they found that when A ring was substituted as pyridine ring could elevate the activity because it contained a basic nitrogen in the 2-position to occupy the hydrophobic pocket. As for the aromatics on A ring, substitutions on meta position was proved to be superior to ortho or para position, and this position was very sensitive to the nature of substitution with preference for small hydrophobic substituent groups without branching on the a-carbon, considering to influence of the size of substituted atom on the hydrophobic pocket, bromo group was selected for the suitable substitution for further investigation.Asymmetric synthesis asymmetric spiro-pyrazolone derivatives have been a hotspot in recent years, while the investigations of bioactivity about these productions and the relationships between their enantioisomerism and activity are still rare. Bao et al. [141] synthesized a series of dispirotriheterocyclic scaffold derivatives and screened the inhibitory effects against hCE1. It is worth noting that the most potent compound 189 (Fig. 19) , in which there were two chiral centers important for inhibitory potency, exerted the strong inhibition with IC 50 value of 0.39 mM, whose activity was 20fold stronger than its enantiomer, indicating the importance of asymmetric [3 \u00fe 2] cyclization process."", ""Conclusion and perspective"": ""Pyrazolone core is one of the most explored precursors among diverse fused heterocycles, capable of multiple roles in different pathophysiological conditions. According to the concept of generalized bioisosteres [142, 143] , as a typical synthetic rather than natural motif in medicinal chemistry, pyrazolone is potential to replace multiple moieties with similar chemical structure and bioactivities including parazole, imidazolin-5-one and 2,4-dihydro-1,2,4-triazol-3-one, etc., providing an important scaffold for drug development. Being a versatile molecule with immense biological significance, pyrazolone derivatives are being developed for several pathological screening including antimicrobial, antitumor, CNS effect, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitubercular, antiviral and protein inhibitors activities since long.The development of pyrazolone derivatives can be regarded as the epitome of medicinal chemistry, starting from antipyrine, several analogues have been explored and the precursor designing methods have evolved from structural modification to Fragment Based Drug Design and high-throughput screening simultaneously. With the development of science, machine learning, virtual screening and combinatorial chemistry technologies shorten the time of filtrating the leading compounds and will play a more and more important role in drug design in the future [144, 145] . Investigations for privileged scaffold from the perspective of SAR have been lasting several years [146e151]. It is probable that pyrazolone scaffold has its position in the establishment of compound library due to its good drug-likeness and broad bioactive properties. Moreover, as we mentioned in this article, the pyrazolone group maintains properties like aromatic and it is feasible to form pi-alkyl effect with residues in the potential target, and the carbonyl group in pyrrazole is a favorable hydrogen acceptor which is feasible to form potential H-bond, which provide evidence for the importance of pyrazolone structural motif in medicinal chemistry.Pan Assay Interference Compounds studies consider that some poor drug-likeness compounds bring false positive results [152, 153] , but pyrazolone is not on the list. Besides, the toxicity of pyrazolone derivatives is still alarming [154] , because the loss and harm caused by the side effects of antipyrine and aminopyrine including leukopenia and agranulocytosis are still vivid. In this review, we have disclosed recent role of pyrazolones in the field of medicinal chemistry by discussing insights of SAR studies and binding conformations of these heterocycle compounds with a variety of targets.

During recent years, extensive research has been focused on developing computationally efficient and accurate models that can find novel noncoding RNAs and reveal their associated biological functions. Unlike the messenger RNAs that encode the amino acid residues of protein molecules, noncoding RNA molecules play direct roles in a variety of biological processes including gene regulation, RNA processing, and modification. For example, the human 7SK RNA binds and inhibits the transcription elongation factor P-TEFb [17] [25] and the RNase P RNA processes the 5' end of precursor tRNAs and some rRNAs [7] . Noncoding RNAs include more than 100 different families [23] . Genome annotation based on models constructed from homologous sequence families could be a reliable and effective approach to enlarging the known families of noncoding RNAs.The functions of noncoding RNAs are, to a large extent, determined by the secondary structures they fold into. Secondary structures are formed by bonded base pairs between nucleotides and may remain unchanged while the nucleotide sequence may have been significantly modified through mutations over the course of evolution. Profiling models based solely on sequence content such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [12] may miss structural homologies when directly used to search genomes for noncoding RNAs containing complex secondary structures. Models that can profile noncoding RNAs must include both the content and the structural information from the homologous sequences. The Covariance Model (CM) developed by Eddy and Durbin [6] extends the profiling HMM by allowing the coemission of paired nucleotides on certain states to model base pairs, and introduces bifurcation states to emit parallel stems. The CM is capable of modeling secondary structures comprised of nested and parallel stems. However, pseudoknot structures, where at least two structurally interleaving stems are involved, cannot be directly modeled with the CM and have remained computationally intractable for searching [1] [13] [14] [18] [19] [20] [21] [24] .So far, only a few systems have been developed for profiling and searching for RNA pseudoknots. One example is ERPIN developed by Gautheret and Lambert [8] [15] . ERPIN searches genomes by sequentially looking for single stem loop motifs contained in the noncoding RNA gene, and reports a hit when significant alignment scores are observed for all the motifs at their corresponding locations. Since ERPIN does not allow the presence of gaps when it performs alignments, it is computationally very efficient. However, alignments with no gaps may miss distant homologies and thus result in a lower sensitivity.Brown and Wilson [2] proposed a more realistic model comprised of a number of Stochastic Context Free Grammar (SCFG) [3] [22] components to profile pseudoknot structures. In their model, the interleaving stems in a pseudoknot structure are derived from different components; the pseudoknot structure is modeled as the intersection of components. The optimal alignment score of a sequence segment is computed by aligning it to all the components iteratively. The model can be used to search sequences for simple pseudoknot structures efficiently. However, a generic framework for modeling interleaving stems and carrying out the search was not proposed in their work. For pseudoknots with more complex structure, more than two SCFG components may be needed and the extension of the iterative alignment algorithm to k components may require k! different alignments in total since all components are treated equally in their model.In this paper, we propose a new method to search for RNA pseudoknot structures using a model of multiple CMs. Unlike the model of Brown and Wilson, we use independent CM components to profile the interleaving stems in a pseudoknot. Based on the model, we have developed a generic framework for modeling interleaving stems of pseudoknot structures; we propose an algorithm that can efficiently assign stems to components such that interleaving stems are profiled in different components. The components with more stems are associated with higher weights in determining the overall conformation of a sequence segment. In order to efficiently perform alignments of the sequence segment to the model, instead of iteratively aligning the sequence segment to the CM components, our searching algorithm aligns it to each component independently following the descending order of component weights. The statistical log-odds scores are computed based on the structural alignment scores of each CM component. Stem contention may occur such that two or more base pairs obtained from different components require the participation of the same nucleotide. Due to the conformational constraints inherently imposed by the CM components, stem contentions occur infrequently (less than 30%) and can be effectively resolved based on the conformational constraints from the alignment results on components with higher weight values. The algorithm is able to accomplish the search with a worst case time complexity of O((k \u2212 1)W 3 L) and a space complexity of O(kW 2 ), where k is the number of CM components in the model, W and L are the size of the searching window and the length of the genome respectively. We used the model to search for a variety of RNA pseudoknots inserted in randomly generated sequences. Experiments show that the model can achieve excellent sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) on almost all of them, while using only slightly more computation time than searching for pseudoknot-free RNA structures. We then applied the model and the searching algorithm to identify the pseudoknots on the 3' untranslated region in several RNA genomes from the corona virus family. An exact match between the locations found by our program and the real locations is observed. Finally, in order to test the ability of our program to cope with noncoding RNA genes with complex pseudoknot structures, we carried out an experiment where the complete DNA genomes of two bacteria were searched to find the locations of the tmRNA genes. The results show that our program identified the location with a reasonable amount of error (with a right shift of around 20 nucleotide bases) for one bacterial genome and for the other bacteria search was perfect. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experiment where a whole genome of more than a million nucleotides is searched for a complex structure that contains pseudoknots."", ""Experiments and Results"": ""To test the performance of the model, we developed a search program in C language and carried out searching experiments on a Sun/Solaris workstation. The workstation has 8 dual processors and 32GB main memory. We evaluated the accuracy of the program on both real genomes and randomly generated sequences with a number of RNA pseudoknot structures inserted. The RNAs we choose to test the model are shown in Table 1 . Model training and testing are based on the multiple alignments downloaded from the Rfam database [10] . For each RNA pseudoknot, we divided the available data into a training set and a testing set, and the parameters used to model it are estimated based on multiple structural alignments among 5 \u2212 90 homologous training sequences with a pairwise identity less than 80%. The emission probabilities of all nucleotides for a given state in a CM component are estimated by computing their frequencies to appear in the corresponding column in the multiple alignment of training sequences; transition probabilities are computed similarly by considering the rel- Table 2 . The performance of the model on different RNA pseudoknots inserted into a background (of 10 5 nucleotides) randomly generated with different C+G concentrations. TN is the total number of pseudoknotted sequence segments inserted; CI is the number of sequence segments correctly identified by the program (with a positional error less than \u00b13 bases); NH is the number of sequence segments returned by the program; SE and SP are sensitivity and specificity respectively. The thresholds of log-odds score are predetermined using the Z-score value of 4.0. ative frequencies for different types of transitions that occur between the corresponding consecutive columns in the alignment. Pseudocounts, dependent on the number of training sequences, are included to prevent overfitting of the model to the training data."", ""RNA"": ""To measure the sensitivity and specificity of the searching program within a reasonable amount of time, for each selected pseudoknot structure, we selected 10 \u2212 40 sequence segments from the set of testing data and inserted them into each of the randomly generated sequences of 10 5 nucleotides. In order to test whether the model is sensitive to the base composition of the background sequence, we varied the C+G concentration in the random background. The program computes the log-odds, the logarithmic ratio of the probability of generating sequence segment s by the null (random) model R to that by our model M . It reports a hit when the Z-score of s is greater than 4.0. The computation of Z-scores requires knowing the mean and standard deviation for the distribution of log-odd scores of random sequence segments; both of them can be determined with methods similar to the ones introduced by Klein and Eddy [11] before the search starts.As can be seen in Table 2 , the program correctly identifies more than 80% of inserted sequence segments with excellent specificity in most of the experiments. The only exception is the srpRNA, where the program misses more than 50% inserted sequence segments in one of the experiments. The relatively lower sensitivity in that particular experiment can be partly ascribed to the fact that the pseudoknot structure of srpRNA contains fewer nucleotides; thus its structural and sequence patterns have a larger probability to occur randomly. The running time for srpRNA, however, is also significantly shorter than that needed by most of other RNA pseudoknots due to the smaller size of the model. Additionally, while the alpha\u2212RBS pseudoknot has a more complex structure and three CM components are needed to model it, our searching algorithm efficiently identifies more than 95% of the inserted pseudoknots with high specificities. A higher C+G concentration in the background does not adversely affect the specificity of the model; it is evident from Table 2 that the program achieves better overall performance in both sensitivity and specificity in a background of higher C+G concentrations. We therefore conjecture that the specificity of the model is partly determined by the base composition of the genome and is improved if the base composition of the target gene is considerably different from its background.To test the accuracy of the program on real genomes, we performed experiments to search for particular pseudoknot structures in the genomes for a variety of organisms. Table 3 shows the genomes on which we have searched with our program and the locations annotated for the corresponding pseudoknot structures. The program successfully identified the exact locations of known 3'UTR pseudoknot in four genomes from the family of corona virus. This pseudoknot was recently shown to be essential for the replication of the viruses in the family [9] .In addition, the genomes of the bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis MC58, were searched for their tmRNA genes. The Haemophilus influenzae DNA genome contains about 1.8 \u00d7 10 6 nucleotides and Neisseria meningitidis MC58 DNA genome contains about 2.2 \u00d7 10 6 nucleotides. The tmRNA functions in the transtranslation process to add a C-terminal peptide tag to the incomplete protein product of Table 3 . The results obtained with our searching program on the genomes of a variety of organisms. GA is the accession number of the genome; RL specifies the real location of the pseudoknot structure in the genome; SL is the one returned by the program; RT is the running time needed to perform the searching in hours; GL is the length of the genome in its number of bases. a defective mRNA [16] . The central part of the secondary structure of tmRNA molecule consists of four pseudoknot structures. Figure 1 shows the pseudoknot structures on the tmRNA molecule. In order to search the bacterial DNA genomes efficiently, the combined pseudoknots 1 and 2 were used to search the genome first; the program searches for the whole tmRNA gene only in the region around the locations where a hit for Pk1 and Pk2 is detected. We cut the genome into segments with shorter lengths (around 10 5 nucleotide bases for each), and ran the program in parallel on ten of them in two rounds. The result for Neisseria meningitidis MC58 shows that we successfully identified the exact locations of tmRNA. However, the locations of tmRNA obtained for Haemophilus influenzae have a shift of around 20 nucleotides with respect to its real location (7% of the length of the tmRNA). This slight error can probably be ascribed to our \""hit-andextend\"" searching strategy to resolve the difficulty arising from the complex structure and the relatively much larger size of tmRNA genes; positional errors may occur during different searching stages and accumulate to a significant value. Our experiment on the DNA genomes also demonstrates that, for each genome, it is very likely there is only one tmRNA gene in it, since our program found only one significant hit. To our knowledge, this is the first computational experiment where a whole genome of more than a million nucleotides was successfully searched for a complex structure that contains pseudoknot structures."", ""Models and Algorithms"": ""The Covariance Model (CM) proposed by Eddy and Durbin [6] [5] can effectively model the base pairs formed between nucleotides in an RNA molecule. Similarly to the emission probabilities in HMMs, the emission probabilities in the CM for both unpaired nucleotides and base pairs are positional dependent. The profiling of a stem hence consists of a chain of consecutive emissions of base pairs. Parallel stems on the RNA sequence are modeled with bifurcation transitions where a bifurcation state is split into two states. The parallel stems are then generated from the transitions starting with the two states that result respectively. The genome is scanned by a window with an appropriate length. Each location of the window is scored by aligning all subsequence segments contained in the window to the model with the CYK algorithm. The maximum log-odds score of them is determined as the log-odds score associated with the location. A hit is reported for a location if the computed log-odds score is higher than a predetermined threshold value.Pseudoknot structures are beyond the profiling capability of a single CM due to the inherent context sensitivity of pseudoknots. Models for pseudoknot structures require a mechanism for the description of their interleaving stems. Previous work by Brown and Wilson [2] and Cai et al. [4] has modeled the pseudoknot structures with grammar components that intersect or cooperatively communicate. A similar idea is adopted in this work; a number of independent CM components are combined to resolve the difficulty in profiling that arises from the interleaving stems. Interleaving stems are profiled in different CM components and the alignment score of a sequence segment is determined based on a combination of the alignment scores on all components.However, the optimal conformations from the alignments on different components may violate some of the conformational constraints that a single RNA sequence must follow. For example, a nucleotide rarely forms two different base pairs simultaneously with other nucleotides in an RNA molecule. This type of restriction is not considered by the independent alignments carried out in our model and thus may lead to erroneous searching results if not treated properly. In our model, stem contention may occur. We break the contention by introducing different priorities to components; base pairs determined from components with the highest priority win the contention. We hypothesize that, biochemically, components profiling more stems are likely to play more dominant roles in the formation of the conformation and are hence assigned higher priority weights."", ""Model Generation"": ""In order to profile the interleaving stems in a pseudoknot structure with independent CM components, we need an algorithm that can partition the set of stems on the RNA sequence into a number of sets comprised of stems that mutually do not interleave. Based on the consensus structure of the RNA sequence, an undirected graph G = (V, E) can be constructed where V , the set of vertices in G, consists of all stems on the sequence. Two vertices are connected with an edge in G if the corresponding stems are in parallel or nested. The set of vertices V needs to be partitioned into subsets such that the subgraph induced by each subset forms a clique.We use a greedy algorithm to perform the partition. Starting with a vertex set S initialized to contain a arbitrarily selected vertex, the algorithm iteratively searches the neighbors of the vertices in S and computes the set of vertices that are connected to all vertices in S. It then randomly selects one vertex v that is not in S from the set and modifies S by assigning v to S. The algorithm outputs S as one of the subsets in the partition when S can not be enlarged and randomly selects an unassigned vertex and repeats the same procedure. It stops when every vertex in G has been included in a subset. Although the algorithm does not minimize the number of subsets in the partition, our experiments show that it can efficiently provide optimal partitions of the stems on pseudoknot structures of moderate structural complexity.The CM components in the profiling model are generated and trained based on the partition of the stems. The stems in the same subset are profiled in the same CM component. For each component, the parameters are estimated by considering the consensus structure formed by the stems in the subset only."", ""Searching Algorithm"": ""The optimal alignments of a sequence segment to the CM components are computed with the dynamic programming based CYK algorithm. As we have mentioned before, higher priority weights are assigned to components with more stems profiled. The component with the maximum number of stems thus has the maximum weight and is the dominant component in the model. The algorithm performs alignments in the descending order of component weights. It selects the sequence segment that maximizes the log-odds score from the dominant component. The alignment scores and optimal conformations of this segment on other components are then computed and combined to obtain the overall log-odds score for the segment's position on the genome.More specifically, we assume that the model contains k CM components M 0 , M 1 , ..., M k\u22121 in descending order of component weights. The algorithm considers all possible sequence segments s d that are enclosed in the window and uses Equation (1) to determine the sequence segment s to be the candidate for further consideration, where W is the length of the window used in searching, and Equation (2) to compute the overall log-odds score for s. We use sm i to denote the parts of s that are aligned to the stems profiled in CM component M i . Basically, Log odds(sm i |M i ) accounts for the contributions from the alignment of sm i to M i . The log-odds score of sm i is counted in both M 0 and M i and must be subtracted from the sum.Log odds(s|M ) = Log odds(s|M 0 )"", ""Stem Contention"": ""The conformations corresponding to the optimal alignments of a sequence segment to all CM components are obtained by tracing back the dynamic programming matrices and checking to ensure that no stem contention occurs. Since each nucleotide in the sequence is represented with a state in a CM component, the CM inherently imposes constraints on the optimal conformations of sequence segments aligned to it. We hence expect that stem contention occurs with a low frequency. In order to verify this intuition, we tested the model on sequences randomly generated with different base compositions and evaluated the frequencies of stem contentions for pseudoknot structures on which we have performed an accuracy test; the results are shown in Figure 2 .The presence of stem contention increases the running time of the algorithm, because the alignment of one of the involved components must be recomputed to resolve the contention. Based on the assumption that components with more stems contribute more to the stability of the optimal conformation, we resolve the contention in favor of such components. We perform recomputation on the component with a lower number of stems by incorporating conformational constraints inherited from components with more stems into the alignment algorithm, preventing them from forming the contentious stems.Specifically, we assume that stem S j \u2208 M i and stem contention occurs between S j and other stems profiled in M i\u22121 ; the conformational constraints from the component M i\u22121 are in the format of (l 1 , l 2 ) and (r 1 , r 2 ). In other words, to avoid the stem con- tmRNA-pk34 telomerase-vert tombus-3-IV alpha-RBS srpRNA Fig. 2 . 4000 random sequences were generated at each given base composition and aligned to the corresponding profiling model. The sequences are of about the same length as the length of the pseudoknot structure. The stem contention rates for each pseudoknot structure were measured and plotted. They were the ratio of the number of random sequences in which stem contentions occurred to the number of total random sequences. Left: plots of profiling models observed to have a stem contention rate lower than 20%, right: plots of these with slightly higher stem contention frequencies. The experimental results demonstrate that, in all pseudoknots where we have performed accuracy tests, stem contention occurs with a rate lower than 30% and is insensitive to the base composition of sequences. tention, the left and right parts of the stem must be the subsequences of indices (l 1 , l 2 ) and (r 1 , r 2 ) respectively. The dynamic programming matrices for S j are limited to the rectangular region that satisfies l 1 \u2264 s \u2264 l 2 and r 1 \u2264 t \u2264 r 2 . The stem contention frequency depends on the conformational flexibilities of the components in the covariance model. More flexibilities in conformation may improve the sensitivity of the model but cause higher contention frequency and thus increase the running time for the algorithm. In the worst case, recomputation is needed for all nondominant components in the model and the time complexity of the algorithm becomes O((k \u2212 1)W 3 L), where k is the number of components in the model, W and L are the window length and the genome length respectively."", ""Conclusions and Future Work"": ""In this paper, we have introduced a new model that serves as the basis for a generic framework that can efficiently search genomes for the noncoding RNAs with pseudoknot structures. Within the framework, interleaving stems in pseudoknot structures are modeled with independent CM components and alignment is performed by aligning sequence segments to all components following the descending order of their weight values. Stem contention occurs with a low frequency and can be resolved with a dynamic programming based recomputation. The statistical log-odds scores are computed based on the alignment results from all components. Our experiments on both random and biological data demonstrate that the searching framework achieves excellent performance in both accuracy and efficiency and can be used to annotate genomes for noncoding RNA genes with complex secondary structures in practice.We were able to search a bacterial genome for a complete structure with a pseudoknot in about one week on our Sun workstation. It would be desirable to improve our algorithm so that we could search larger genomes and databases. The running time, however, could be significantly shortened if a filter can be designed to preprocess DNA genomes and only the parts that pass the filtering process are aligned to the model. Alternatively, it may be possible to devise alternative profiling methods to the covariance model that would allow faster searches.""}",Profiling and Searching for RNA Pseudoknot Structures in Genomes,We developed a new method that can profile and efficiently search for pseudoknot structures in noncoding RNA genes.

Therefore, there is growing interest in the development of drugs, drinks, and functional foods using natural substances with few side effects (Eliott, 1996) . As an essential element in the healthy lifestyle of modern individuals, the importance of immunity has been recognized; accordingly, there has been a recent increase in the consumption of health functional foods that assist in enhancing immunity.Rhodiola crenulata, which is found in the alpine regions of Northeast Asia, Central Asia, North America, and Northern Europe, is a perennial herb of Angiospermae order, Crassulaceae family, and Rhodiola genus, and its roots and stems are used as medicines. In Europe and Asia, R. crenulata is a traditional drug with efficacy in stimulating the nervous system, reducing depression, enhancing work capacity, promoting fatigue recovery, and preventing altitude sickness (Ishaque, Shamseer, Bukutu, & Vohra, 2012; Kelly, 2001; Lee, 1998) . Unofficially, R. crenulata has been used as a fever reducer, sedative, and astringent and has been reported to show antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and liver toxicity protection activities (Choe et al., 2012; Kwon, Jang, & Shetty, 2006; Wu, Lian, Jiang, & Nan, 2009; Zou et al., 2015) . Recently, researchers have reported that R. crenulata has additional beneficial effects, including antioxidant activity (Kanupriya et al., 2005) and protection against neuron damage (Mook-Jung et al., 2002) . The main components mediating these effects are salidroside and tyrosol.Panax quinquefolius is known to have various pharmacological properties, including effects in the cardiovascular and central nervous systems as well as antidiabetic, antitumor, and immunoregulatory effects. Accordingly, P quinquefolius is one of the most commonly consumed herbs in the United States of America and is widely used as a commercial material for ginseng products (Ang- Lee, Moss, & Yuan, 2001; Attele, Wu, & Yuan, 1999; Court, 2000) .Astragalus membranaceus is a representative drug used to sustain energy and is known to have several important properties, including warmth, sweetness, and lack of toxins. In oriental medicine, A. membranaceus is used to enhance brain function, improve diuresis, increase strength, and prevent gastrointestinal cancers and has been reported to have anti-inflammatory, strength-enhancing, blood glucose level-reducing, immune-enhancing, antitumor, and blood pressure-reducing effects in pharmacological experiments (Auyeung, Han, & Ko, 2016; Jia, Jiang, Qiao, & Chen, 2003; Shao et al., 2004) .Herbal and oriental medicines consist of many medicinal herbs, in contrast to synthetic drugs, and many substances interact to exhibit medicinal effects. The most notable examples include gumiganghwaltang (Kim et al., 2005; Moon, Go, & Park, 1999) , which is used to treat cold and infections, and Sipjjeondaebotang, which is used to treat weak blood flow and cold sweat (Oh et al., 2014) . In products with more than one substance, it is difficult to optimize the appropriate component ratios during mixture experiments because the substances often bind to each other to produce independent effects or interact to form a single product. The mixture design method is an experiment used to identify substances that exhibit significant effects on the targeted dependent variable and results in maximum or minimum reaction in mixture extract experiments; this method is also commonly used to determine the optimum mixing ratio (Cornell, 1990) .In this study, we used the mixture design method for functional extract development to identify the optimum mixing ratio of these three commonly used herbs in order to enhance extract yield and immune activity. We then verified the predictions and evaluated the immuneenhancing effects of the optimum mixture extract in an animal model."", ""Materials"": ""A. crenulata, P. quinquefolia, and A. membranaceus were provided by Dalian University, China in April 2016.

The extract yield and amounts of nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin (IL)-6 produced by macrophages were measured for each extract. Activated macrophages, T lymphocytes, and NK cells mainly produce cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2, and they play important roles in the cellular immune process by promoting the elimination of abnormal cells (Liu et al., 2009 ). Therefore, NO or IL-6 were considered as the dependent variables of extracts from 10 experimental points in this study. The mixing ratio of the experimental points is shown in Table 1 , and all experimental orders were conducted at random to reduce error from division.2.3.

The contour lines for NO production by mixture showed an increasing trend in the production of NO, an immunologic factor, as the mixing ratio of R. crenulata increased, but a decreasing trend in NO production as the mixing ratios of P. quinquefolia and A. membranaceus increased, suggesting that A. membranaceus and P. quinquefolia did not greatly affect NO production compared with R. crenulata (Fig. 2B) . The results of regression analysis for IL-6 production are shown in Supplementary Table S3 . The R 2 for the IL-6 production model was 98.61%, and the adj R 2 was 96.87%, reflecting the suitability of the model (Supplementary Table S3 ). The suitability of the model was further verified with variance analysis as shown in Supplementary Table S3 to verify not only the suitability of the reaction model but also the significance and coefficient of each term (Supplementary Table S3 ). From interacting terms, the p value for R. crenulata \u00d7 P. quinquefolia was 0.006, reflecting the greatest significance in the reaction model for this experiment. The contour lines for IL-6 production showed an increasing trend in the production of IL-6, an important cytokine in the immune response, as the mixing ratio of R. crenulata increased, but a decreasing trend in IL-6 production as the mixing ratios of P. quinquefolia and A. membranaceus increased, suggesting that A. membranaceus and P. quinquefolia did not greatly affect IL-6 production compared with R. crenulata (Fig. 2C) ."", ""Optimization of the mixture"": ""It is necessary to determine the optimum mixing ratio for each ingredient to obtain complex extracts with high extraction yields and immune-enhancing activity in order to support the commercial use and economic feasibility of the product. To determine the optimum mixing ratios of R. crenulata, A. membranaceus, and P. quinquefolia, a reaction optimization tool was used in the mixture design. The optimization technique in the mixture design is a method to find the optimum level of factors by gradually moving towards the optimized direction through calculation of response variable values for the experimental point at each stage. By setting extract yields and amounts of NO and IL-6 produced by macrophages to the maximum, the determined reaction equation from the model was used to predict the satisfying numerical point. The predicted optimum values of the mixing ratio to obtain complex extracts with high extract yield, as well as immune enhancing activity, were 49.5% for R. crenulata, 26.1% for A. membranaceus, and 24.4% for P. quinquefolia, and the predicted response values based on the determined mixing ratios were 31.5% yield, 13.4% NO production, and 6.1% IL-6 production (Fig. 3) . To verify the predicted response values, extracts, referred to as the OMRE consisting of 50% R. crenulata, 26% A. membranaceus, and 24% P. quinquefolia were prepared, and 35.3% yield, 14.7% NO production, and 6.6% IL-6 production were obtained. In order to identify the substances that significantly affected the response variables and optimum mixing ratios to satisfy the response variables, we used mixture design. Our findings could be used to develop functional drinks with high added value in the food industry. Moreover, R. crenulata, which has various physiological activities, could show greater value in improving food quality by mixing R. crenulata with A. membranaceus and P. quinquefolia to develop a complex extract. Recent studies have reported the optimum mixing ratios for Petasites japonicus, Luffa cylindrica, and Houttuynia cordata mixture to treat respiratory diseases (Jeong et al., 2015) , and a mixture design has been used to optimizing the mixing ratio in Chinese quince jam production (Lee & Jang, 2009 )."", ""Effects of OMRE on the spleen index and splenic lymphocyte proliferation in mice"": ""The spleen is an important immune organ and is critical for the nonspecific immunity of organisms (Chen, Tang, Wang, Sun, & Liang, 2012) . Immune stimulators can increase spleen weights . Here, mice were treated with the OMRE by oral administration at 100 or 200 mg/kg, and the effects of OMRE on the spleen index are presented in Fig. 4A . When the mice were treated with OMRE at 200 mg/kg, the spleen index was significantly increased compared with that of the control group. The spleen index tended to increase when used at the lower dose as well (100 mg/kg); however, this difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 4A) . CVT-E002, an immunostimulatory polysaccharide-rich extract from the roots of North American ginseng (P. quinquefolium), was used as a positive control (Biondo et al., 2008) . The proliferation of splenic cells is one of the most important steps in the activation of cell-mediated or humoral immunity (Zhao, Li, Luo, & Wu, 2006) . Splenic cell proliferation in mice treated with OMRE is presented in Fig. 4B and C. Con A and LPS were used to stimulate T-and B-lymphocyte proliferation, respectively (Cerqueira et al., 2004) . T-and B-lymphocyte proliferation was increased in the OMRE-treated group compared with that in the negative control group. Splenic cell proliferation capacity has been widely used as a method to screen for new immune stimulators because cell division and DNA synthesis can be stimulated by various antigens, mitogens, and cytokines (Kruisbeek, Shevach, & Thornton, 2004) . In this study,administration of OMRE increased the mitogen-stimulated proliferation of splenic cells in mice. These results suggested that OMRE activated mouse lymphocytes.3.6. Cytokine production in mitogen-induced splenocytes OMRE treatment significantly increased IL-10 cytokine levels in Con A-induced T lymphocytes by stimulation of T cells (Fig. 5A ). IL-10 may act in an autocrine manner to suppress antigen-presenting cell (APC) pro-inflammatory responses, act directly on effector T cells to limit their proliferation and function, or promote the differentiation of naive T cells into regulatory populations (Couper, Blount, & Riley, 2008) . In LPS-induced B-lymphocyte supernatants, the amount of IL-10 was increased by OMRE treatment (Fig. 5A ). Most cytokines with B-cell growth factor activity in vitro, including IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10, are also able to induce partial differentiation of B cells into plasma cells secreting Ig (Banchereau & Rousset, 1992) . IL-10 is the most potent B-cell differentiation factor, inducing complete differentiation of B cells into mature plasma cells in association with CD40 activation (Rousset et al., 1992) . As shown in Fig. 5B , treatment with OMRE at 200 mg/kg significantly increased IL-6 production in Con A-or LPS-stimulated splenocytes supernatants. IL-6 stimulates the terminal differentiation of B cells into plasma cells and plays a central role in fever and acute phase responses (Muraguchi et al., 1988; Sica et al., 1990) . IL-6 is secreted by T cells and macrophages to stimulate immune responses and promotes T-cell proliferation, T helper cell differentiation, and T cell-mediated cytotoxicity by CD81 cells. Moreover, IL-6 synergizes with IL-1\u03b2 in the development of cell-mediated immune responses (Houssiau & Van Snick, 1992; Okada et al., 1988) ."", ""Effects of OMRE on the proliferation and production of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 in activated mouse T cells"": ""To investigate whether OMRE directly influenced proliferation as well as IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 production, mouse T cells were isolated from spleen by magnetic sorting with Dynabeads and then stimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28. As shown in Fig. 6A , anti-CD3/CD28 co- stimulation significantly enhanced T-cell proliferation compared to the unstimulated control (CD3 \u2212 /CD28 \u2212 ). Proliferation significantly increased when anti-CD3/CD28-activated T cells were treated with OMRE (50, 100, or 200 \u03bcg/mL). These results suggest that OMRE enhanced the proliferative capability of anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells. Since OMRE increased the proliferation of anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells, we investigated whether OMRE could affect IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 production in these cells. OMRE significantly increased the production of IL-2 ( Fig. 6B ) and IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 6C) , the hallmark cytokines for Th1-type in anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated T cell."", ""Conclusions"": ""A mixture design method was applied to functional extract development to identify the optimum mixing ratio of these three commonly used herbs in order to enhance extract yield and immune activity. We then verified the predicted optimum values for the mixing ratio and evaluated the immune-enhancing effects of the optimum mixture extract in an animal model.

Chloroquine can also inhibit the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 as"", ""What's new?"": ""Chloroquine treatment increases the QTc interval. The timing of the electrocardiogram recording within the dosing interval is not relevant. Within the treatment period of 5 days, the QTc interval continues to increase. It is advisable to monitor QTc intervals throughout the treatment period. It is advisable to measure the QTc interval manually before adjusting the dose or withdrawing the treatment. the necessary concentration (EC50) can be reached with a cumulative dose of 3300 mg [3, 4] . Chloroquine has been considered as a treatment option in the Dutch guidelines since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the Netherlands [5] .A common side effect of chloroquine is prolongation of the QT interval. It is on the CredibleMeds list of drugs associated with a 'known risk of torsades de pointes (TdP)' [6] . Limited data on the extent of this QT-prolonging effect are available from trials where chloroquine was used as an antimalarial drug [7, 8] . Furthermore, the dosages used in these trials for malaria were lower and the duration was shorter than in the therapy for COVID-19. Recently, a study with 95 patients treated with chloroquine for COVID-19 was published [9] . This study found a mean increase in the QTc interval of 35 ms, which is remarkably longer than the previously described prolongations of 6 and 16 ms [7, 8] .In order to further evaluate the QTc-prolongation potential of chloroquine, we conducted a retrospective observational study. The main aim of this study was to assess the QTc-prolongation potential of chloroquine in COVID-19 patients."", ""Methods"": ""This retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted at two teaching hospitals in the Netherlands (Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital (ETH) in Tilburg and Meander Medical Centre (MMC) in Amersfoort) from 10 March until 22 April 2020. All patients aged over 18 years, hospitalised for a suspected or proven infection with COVID-19, and therefore treated with chloroquine, with a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) performed prior to the start of treatment and at least one ECG after starting the treatment with chloroquine were included. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, the medical ethical committee of Brabant waived the requirement for individual informed consent.The main outcome measure was the difference in QTc time (\u0394QTc) between the QTc interval of the baseline ECG (ECG-0) and the first ECG taken after the start of the chloroquine treatment (ECG-1). Secondary outcome measures were the \u0394QTc between the QTc interval of ECG-0 and the last available ECG during chloroquine treatment (ECG-L), and whether the timing of the ECG during the second dosing interval of chloroquine had a relevant effect on the \u0394QTc found as the primary outcome measure. We studied the association of several known risk factors associated with an increase of the QTc interval. For patients from the ETH population, where chloroquine treatment was stopped because of a prolonged QTc interval (>500 ms, or an increase >60 ms from baseline), the QTc interval was manually recalculated by a cardiologist to verify the justification for stopping chloroquine treatment.All patients admitted to the hospital with a suspected or proven infection with COVID-19 were treated with chloroquine according to the Dutch guidelines [5] . The dosing regimen for chloroquine consisted of a loading dose of 600 mg followed by 300 mg twice daily, starting 12 h after the loading dose. The duration of the total regimen was 5 days, reaching a cumulative dose of chloroquine of 3300 mg. The exact administration date and time for all the chloroquine administrations were extracted from the electronic patient record.The following patient characteristics were obtained from the medical record: sex, age, weight and body mass index, renal function at the start of chloroquine treatment, electrolyte levels prior to and during treatment (potassium, magnesium and calcium) and duration of chloroquine treatment. Comorbidity at the start of the treatment was classified by the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Relevant concurrent use of other potentially QTc-prolonging co-medication, defined as medication with a 'known risk of TdP' according to the CredibleMeds list, was defined as at least one administration 24 h prior to or 48 h after the first dose of chloroquine [6] . The same was done for lopinavirritonavir since it is known to significantly increase chloroquine plasma concentration and it was initially mentioned as a potential treatment option for COVID-19 in the first version of the Dutch guidelines and was therefore used in combination with chloroquine [10] .A baseline ECG, including heart rate, PR interval, corrected QT interval and QRS duration, was performed prior to initiation of the therapy with chloroquine. The computerised values were used for interpretation using the Marquette 12SL ECG analysis programme (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA).The baseline ECG had to be conducted within 1 month before the start of chloroquine therapy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the first ECG after the start was preferably recorded 24-72 h after the initiation of the treatment. For this study, all the available ECGs recorded during the treatment period with chloroquine were extracted from the hospital information system Epic Systems Corporation (Madison, WI, USA) at the ETH, and from Easycare (Healthcare B.V., Deventer, The Netherlands) at the MMC. Available ECGs were allocated to the dosing interval in which they were recorded. Furthermore, the obtained calcium, potassium and magnesium levels within 12 h prior to or after recording of an ECG were linked to that ECG.For patients in the ETH population who prematurely discontinued treatment or had a dose adjustment, and had a QTc interval above 500 ms and/or an increase of more than 60 ms from baseline, as measured on ECG during the latest dosing interval, the medical records were searched for the reason for premature discontinuation or adjustment in therapy. All ECGs from patients with an adjusted dose or discontinuation of therapy with a QTc interval >500 msThe risk of QTc-interval prolongation in COVID-19 patients treated with chloroquine and/or an increase in QTc interval >60 ms were manually recalculated by a cardiologist using the method described by Postema and Wilde [11] .Data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 24.0 (Armonk, New York, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics were used to describe baseline characteristics. A linear regression analysis was performed to explore whether the timing of the ECG during the second dosing interval of chloroquine had a relevant effect on the \u0394QTc found as the primary outcome measure. An independent t-test was used to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference in QTc prolongation for sex, renal function or potential QTc-prolonging co-medication. Potential QTcprolonging co-medication was dichotomised as either use or no use of potential QTc-prolonging co-medication. Renal function was dichotomised as either a renal function above or under 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 . Simple linear regression analysis was used to predict QTc prolongation from age, baseline electrolyte levels or electrolyte levels around the first ECG after the start. Factors were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05. Factors that were associated with a probability of p < 0.05 in the univariate analysis were entered into multivariate models to adjust for confounding. "", ""Results"": ""A total of 397 patients were included; 344 patients at the ETH and 53 patients at the MMC. These patients had a baseline ECG before starting treatment and at least one ECG during treatment. Baseline characteristics are displayed in Tab. 1.Treatment with chloroquine resulted in a mean QTc prolongation [\u00b1standard deviation (SD)] of 20 \u00b1 39 ms between ECG-0 and ECG-1. Using computerised interpretation, the mean QTc interval before treatment was 448 \u00b1 34 ms, whereas the mean QTc interval of ECG-1 was 468 \u00b1 38 ms. This difference was statistically significant with p < 0.05. The corresponding QRS intervals were 98 \u00b1 20 ms, 100 \u00b1 22 ms and 101 \u00b1 21 ms for ECG-0, ECG-1 and ECG-L respectively. Fig. 1 shows the median, quartiles and mean QTc interval for ECG-0 and ECG-1.To evaluate the relationship between the QTc interval and the cumulative dose of chloroquine, \u0394QTc between ECG-0 and ECG-L was evaluated. Intervals were defined as the time between two administrations of chloroquine, where interval 1 was the time between the loading dose of 600 mg and the following dose of 300 mg. In most patients, only a baseline ECG and one ECG after start were measured. However, 155 patients had more ECGs recorded during the treatment. In these patients, the mean dosing interval in The risk of QTc-interval prolongation in COVID-19 patients treated with chloroquine which the first ECG after the start was recorded was 2 and the mean interval in which the latest ECG was recorded was 6. From these 155 patients, \u0394QTc was calculated for ECG-0 and ECG-L. Fig. 2 displays the median, quartiles and mean QTc interval for ECG-0, Fig. 2 Median QTc interval with interquartile range for the baseline electrocardiogram (ECG-0), the first ECG after the start of treatment (ECG-1) and the last available ECG during chloroquine treatment (ECG-L), based on 155 patients. The mean QTc interval is displayed as X ECG-1 and ECG-L. For the 155 patients, the mean QTc prolongation between ECG-0 and ECG-1 was 20 ms (\u00b143 ms). The mean QTc prolongation between ECG-0 and ECG-L was 33 ms (\u00b153 ms). The differences in QTc interval for ECG-0, ECG-1 and ECG-L were all statistically significant with a p-value of <0.05. In addition, linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between the increase in QTc interval and duration of treatment.To evaluate whether the risk for QTc prolongation increased as a function of the plasma drug concentration (Cmax) during a dosing interval, QTc intervals measured at different time-points during interval 2 (between the second and third administration) were determined for the 179 patients who had an ECG performed in chloroquine dosing interval 2. Fig. 3 displays the time after the second administration of chloroquine and the difference between the baseline QTc and the QTc in dosing interval 2.Sex and renal function were not significantly correlated with the \u0394QTc between ECG-0 and ECG-1. Baseline electrolyte levels and those measured around ECG-1 or age were not associated with the \u0394QTc between ECG-0 and ECG-1. Only the use of potential QTc-prolonging co-medication had a statistically significant effect on QTc prolongation (24 \u00b1 47 ms) between ECG-0 and ECG-1, compared to no use of QTc-prolonging co-medication (18 \u00b1 36 ms), p = 0.004.The risk of QTc-interval prolongation in COVID-19 patients treated with chloroquine Difference in QTc interval (ms)"", ""Time between chloroquine administra\u019fon and ECG (h)"": ""However, this was not considered clinically relevant. Univariate analysis revealed only potential QTc-prolonging co-medication to be a risk factor and therefore a multivariate analysis was not performed. Seventeen out of 397 patients had a baseline QTc interval exceeding 500 ms using computerised interpretation. After consulting a cardiologist, treatment with chloroquine was started in all patients. During treatment with chloroquine, 63 patients had a QTc interval exceeding 500 ms and/or had an increase in QTc >60 ms. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was observed in one patient, who had a manually calculated baseline QTc interval of 481 ms. After the third dose, the manually calculated QTc interval of this patient had increased to 540 ms.Only the group of patients admitted to the ETH was used to identify the number of patients with premature discontinuation or with an adjustment in therapy due to QTc prolongation. Of the 344 patients, 50 patients (14.5%) had prematurely discontinued or had a dose adjustment of chloroquine. In 27 of these 50 patients (54%), chloroquine was discontinued and three patients had a dose reduction to 150 mg twice daily due to QTc prolongation. These clinical decisions seem to have been based on the computerised interpretation of the ECG. The ECGs of these 30 patients were manually recalculated by an independent cardiologist. Chloroquine treatment resulted in a mean prolongation of 75 ms for the computerised interpretation and 43 ms for the manually calculated QTc interval. The manual interpretation disclosed that only 11 patients indeed had a QTc interval of at least 500 ms and/or an increase in QTc of more than 60 ms."", ""Discussion"": ""Our study shows that treatment with chloroquine in COVID-19 patients significantly prolongs the QTc interval with a mean QTc prolongation of 33 ms throughout the treatment. QTc prolongation, defined as a QTc interval above 500 ms or an increase of more than 60 ms from baseline, was seen in a considerable number of patients (16%), even resulting in ventricular tachycardia in one patient.The QTc interval seemed to increase continuously after initiation of therapy. This could possibly be explained by the apparent half-life of 1.6 days [12] . Due to this half-life, the plasma concentration will further increase during the 5 days of treatment and steady state would only be reached 7 days after starting therapy. This is supported by the concentration-time profile of chloroquine, where the cumulative dose of chloroquine is highest at the end of the treatment period [12] . Thus, QTc prolongation and the associated risk of TdP will continue to increase up until the end of the 5-day treatment period.A study in healthy volunteers showed the QTc prolongation to be greatest 4 h after the second dose of chloroquine [7] . However, this was not demonstrated in our study. On the contrary, the QTc prolongation was similar throughout the second dosing interval. Therefore, the timing of an ECG recording within the dosing interval seems irrelevant for chloroquine.The risk of QTc-interval prolongation in COVID-19 patients treated with chloroquine Furthermore, this study demonstrates that 19 patients unnecessarily had their treatment prematurely discontinued or had their dose adjusted due to a prolonged QTc interval based on the computerised interpretation of the ECG. In our study, electronically measured QTc values might differ from the manually performed measurement due to differences in standard lead selection, U-wave recognition, U wave inclusion or exclusion, and definition of T-wave ending [11, 13] . Another study found only a minor difference between the computerised and manual interpretation of the QTc interval [9] . However, the reliability of the computerised measurement of the QTc interval has been found to be questionable and manual measurement of the QTc interval is recommended [11, 13, 14] . Based on the present study, it is recommended that a cardiologist is consulted before clinical decisions are made based on the computerised interpretation.A limitation of this study is the retrospective nature, although our large sample size included various ECGs captured at different time-points during the treatment with chloroquine. A possible bias may have been introduced by not manually recalculating all QTc intervals. However, computerised interpretation is commonly used in clinical practice; thus our study is a good representation of the normal clinical setting."", ""Conclusion"": ""Chloroquine treatment in COVID-19 patients gradually increased the QTc interval during the treatment period, most likely due to the pharmacokinetic profile of chloroquine. Due to a significant number of overestimated QTc intervals by computer analysis, it is advisable to measure the QTc interval manually before adjusting the dose or withdrawing this potentially beneficial medication.Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

The porcine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which is a cause of a fatal diarrhea in newborn piglets, agglutinates erythrocytes in vitro due to SA-binding activity (Krempl et al, 1997) . TGEV containing mutations within the S glycoprotein loses hemagglutinating activity and has reduced enteropathogenicity. Wild-type TGEV binds more efficiently to cells than viral mutants lacking SA-binding activity (Schwegmann-Webels et al, 2002) . Similarly, reovirus type 1 Lang (T1L) binds selectively to M cells with glycoconjugates containing SA in the intestinal epithelium (Helander et al, 2003; Barton et al, 2003; Forrest and Dermody, 2003; Komagome et al, 2002; Liu et al, 1998) .Picornaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses, and cause infection of the enteric and respiratory systems. In natural picornavirus infection in humans, viruses are able to spread from the gut to the central nervous system (CNS), causing meningitis and encephalitis (Melnick, 1996) . However, how these viruses disseminate is not well studied. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) belongs to the family Picornaviridae (Roos, 2002; Fujinami, 1996, 1999; . TMEV is divided into two subgroups: GDVII and TO, based upon neurovirulence. In nature, TMEV transmission occurs by the fecal-oral route, resulting in an unapparent infection of the gut (Lipton et al, 2006) ; however, on occasion, TMEV is able to infect the CNS (Theiler, 1934) . We do not know how TMEV infects in the gut and spread into the CNS, although enteric TMEV infection can be a good model system to study how enteric virus disseminates into the CNS in humans.Experimentally, intracerebral (i.c.) GDVII virus infection of mice causes an acute fatal encephalitis, whereas i.c. infection with the TO subgroup, including Daniels (DA) and BeAn viruses, results in a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease in the CNS (Villarreal et al, 2006) . TMEV encodes four capsid proteins: VP1 to VP4, and has unique loop structures that are made up of connections of the b strand. There are four large loops between the CD strands of VP1 (loops I and II) and the EF strands of VP2 (puffs A and B). Exposed amino acids on all four loops have been shown to be important disease determinants (McCright et al, 1999 (McCright et al, , 2002 Tsunoda et al, 2001; Wada et al, 1998) . Several differences between the TO and GDVII subgroups are located in VP1 loop II and VP2 puff B. These two surface features are located spatially near each other, close to the proposed receptor binding site, ''pit,'' or depression surrounding the fivefold axis of TMEV (Grant et al, 1992; Luo et al, 1996; McCright et al, 1999; Tsunoda et al, 2001) .Although the two subgroups of TMEV may share a common receptor (Fotiadis et al, 1991) , the TO subgroup binds a2,3 SA moieties on N-linked oligosaccharides at the surface of susceptible cells (Fotiadis et al, 1991; Shah and Lipton, 2002; Zhou et al, 1997 Zhou et al, , 2000 . However, the attachment to N-linked oligosaccharides accounts for only a portion of GDVII virus binding (Shah and Lipton, 2002; Lipton et al, 2006) . Atomic modeling of DA virus complexed with sialyllactose was consistent with SA-binding to a positively charged pocket, termed ''gap,'' on the capsid surface (Zhou et al, 2000) . The gap is formed by the interaction between VP1 loop II and VP2 puff B and is shaped differently between GDVII and TO subgroups (Zhou et al, 1997) . SA has been suggested to interact directly with VP2 puff B: VP2-161, -163, and -174 of DA virus (Zhou et al, 2000) and VP2-161 and -174 of BeAn virus (Kumar et al, 2003) . Amino acids comprising VP1 loop II likely influence SA-binding, although they have no direct interactions with SA residues. GDVII virus has been shown to use the proteoglycan heparin sulfate, but not SA, as a coreceptor (Shah and Lipton, 2002; Lipton et al, 2006) . Although it is not clear how differences in SA-binding between GDVII versus TO subgroups contribute to differing biological activities in vivo, the requirement of virus binding to SA on cells could contribute to the different pattern of disease observed between TO versus GDVII virus infection.Previously, we reported neuropathology caused by two DA mutant viruses: DApB and DApBL2M (Tsunoda et al, 2001 (Tsunoda et al, , 2007 . DApB virus encodes the VP2 puff B of GDVII virus with one conservative change from GDVII virus (A173V). DApBL2M virus contains the VP1 loop II of GDVII virus and has a point mutation (S171R) in VP2 puff B. Both mutant viruses are on the background of DA virus. Although all viruses replicated to similar titers in vitro, i.c. infection of mice with GDVII, DA, DApB, and DApBL2M viruses resulted in distinct CNS pathology. During the acute stage, mice infected with GDVII virus had large numbers of apoptotic neurons with a relative lack of T-cell infiltration in the brain and all infected mice died (Tsunoda et al, 2007) . Similarly, the two DA virus mutants induced higher levels of apoptosis in neurons than wild-type DA virus, although levels of inflammation were similar between DA and DA virus mutants (Tsunoda et al, 2007) . During the chronic stage, DA and DApB induced demyelinating disease with virus persistence in the white matter of the spinal cord, whereas DApBL2M caused gray matter lesions in the brain without demyelination (Tsunoda et al, 2001) . These data suggest that conformational differences via interaction of VP1 loop II and VP2 puff B between GDVII and DA viruses play an important role in TMEV disease.We first tested the contribution of VP1 loop II and VP2 puff B in SA-binding in vitro and correlated this with virus replication. TMEV has been shown to cause cytopathic effects (CPEs), but not apoptosis, in permissive baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cells, whereas TMEV causes apoptosis with no or limited CPEs in restrictive cells (Jelachich and Lipton, 1996) . BHK-21 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Binding of TMEV to SA was tested using treatment with neuraminidase (sialidase) to remove cell surface SA prior to virus adsorption/infection (Fotiadis et al, 1991; Jnaoui et al, 2002) . BHK-21 cell monolayers grown in 24well plates were washed with serum-free DMEM at pH 5.5 and then incubated for 1 h at 378C, pH 5.5 with a2-3,6,8-neuraminidase (Vibrio cholerae sialidase, Calbiochem) at 20 and 200 mU/ml. Cells were washed and infected with TMEV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3. After a 1-h virus adsorption, cells were washed and cultured in DMEM containing 2% FBS. CPEs were monitored for 24 h.Neuraminidase treatment inhibited CPEs of BHK-21 cells induced by DA virus, whereas treatment had no effect on GDVII virus infection (Figure 1 ). Interestingly, reduced CPEs by neuraminidase treatment was also seen in DApB virus infection, but not in DApBL2M virus infection. Virus titers were also compared in TMEV-infected cell cultures, with or without SA digestion by neuraminidase, after one replication cycle. At 8 and 24 h post infection (p.i.), infected cells and supernatant fluids were collected, and viral titers were determined by plaque assay (McCright et al, 1999) . Neuraminidase treatment prior to DA and DApB virus infection reduced virus titers by more than 90%, versus mock treated control cultures at 8 h p.i. (Figure 2a) . A dose-dependent reduction of virus titers by neuraminidase treatment was also seen in DA and DApB virus infection at 24 h p.i. (Figure 2b ). In contrast, in GDVII or DApBL2M virus infections, no significant reductions TMEV binding to the GI tract through sialic acid 82 I Tsunoda et al in virus titer by neuraminidase treatment were observed at 8 or 24 h p.i. These results are compatible with previous findings where CPE of BHK-21 cells was reduced in BeAn and DA, but not in GDVII, virus infections by addition of sialyllactose, the first three sugar molecules of common oligosaccharides on the surface of mammalian cells (Fotiadis et al, 1991; Shah and Lipton, 2002; Zhou et al, 1997 Zhou et al, , 2000 , In those experiments, the reduction in the ability of TMEV to infect cells was associated with SA-dependent virus attachment to BHK-21 cells. Therefore, our results predict that VP1 loop II and VP2 puff B influence the requirement for viral attachment to SA on cells. However, it should be noted that, even after high doses of neuraminidase treatment, a substantial amount of virus replication was detected in all TMEV infections; blocking of SA binding did not completely abrogate virus infection/attachment. Although TMEV has been isolated from the gastrointestinal tract, the cell types in the intestine that the (Theiler, 1941) . Therefore, we analyzed the binding of TMEV to murine intestinal epithelium, the natural target for this virus, using virus overlay assays, which have been widely used to test tissue attachment of microbes, such as Helicobacter pylori and influenza virus H5N1 (Falk et al, 1993; van Riel et al, 2006; Helander et al, 2003) (Figure 3) . We harvested the intestine from na\u00efve mice without washing the intestine. We fixed the intestine in 4% paraformaldehyde, em-bedded in paraffin, and made 4-mm paraffin sections. Intestine sections were deparaffinized, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), blocked with PBS containing 3% normal donkey serum for 30 min, and incubated with DMEM containing DA, GDVII, DapB, or DApBL2M virus, at a final concentration of 1 )10 9 plaque-forming units (PFU)/ ml for 1 h. Sections were incubated with antibody against TMEV (Tsunoda et al, 2001) , followed by secondary tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate "", ""Figure 3"": ""Intestine section preparation and a virus overlay assay. Intestinal epithelium is composed of enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and M cells. The intestinal lymphocytes disseminate beneath the epithelium and also between epithelial cells. Lymphocytes are also found within more organized structures, including the Peyer's patch. The luminal surface of the intestine is covered with mucin produced by goblet cells, and the mucin can be stained purple-magenta by PAS. Intestine was harvested from uninfected mice, and was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded longitudinally or transversely in paraffin. Deparaffinized sections were incubated with TMEV for 1 h, followed by rabbit anti-TMEV antibody and TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody against rabbit IgG. Consecutive sections from one na\u00efve mouse were used for one set of experiments.TMEV binding to the GI tract through sialic acid 84 I Tsunoda et al (TRITC) conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG). All four TMEVs showed a similar pattern of attachment to the intestine (Figure 4a to d) . Virus was associated with the mucus at the surface of the intestine and bound to goblet cells. Goblet cells are specialized epithelial cells that synthesize and secrete mucins. This suggests that virus attached to the mucus produced by goblet cells. Virus binding to Peyer's patches was similar; virus was found at the (Figure 4e ). Virus was also seen bound to cells in the crypt of the intestine (Figure 4f ). We did not see autofluorescence in the intestine sections ( Figure 5b ) nor positive staining in negative controls, such as incubation with TMEV antibody and secondary antibody without virus overlay ( Figure   5d ), incubation with secondary antibody alone, and incubation with normal rabbit serum instead of TMEV antibody. The identification of goblet cells was confirmed by periodic acid\u00c1Schiff (PAS) staining where mucins stain purple-magenta (Figure 4g,  h) . The presence of mucins on the intestine sections were confirmed on the luminal surface of the Figure 5 Effect of neuraminidase treatment on virus binding. (a\u00c1c) Intestine sections were incubated with DA virus. Virus binding (red) was visualized with rabbit antibody against TMEV, followed by incubation with TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. The fluorescence was not due to autofluorescence of sections, because it was detectable by the filter for TRITC (a) but not by the filter for FITC (b). (c) Treatment with neuraminidase before DA virus overlay abrogated virus binding. (d) Negative control. Sections were incubated without virus, followed with antibody against TMEV and TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. No staining was seen. GDVII (e, f) or DApB (g, h) virus was incubated with intestine sections without (e, g) or with (f, h) neuraminidase pretreatment. Neuraminidase abrogated GDVII and DApB virus binding. DApBL2M virus overlay assays resulted in similar binding to those in GDVII and DApB viruses (data not shown). Magnification (a\u00c1f) )100, (g, h) )200 to (a\u00c1f) )70, (g, h) )140. Because all four TMEVs showed similar binding to the intestinal tissue, this suggested that all four TMEVs use a similar receptor/co-receptor. To test whether virus attachment depended on SA-binding, prior to incubation with TMEV, tissue sections were incubated in serum-free DMEM containing neuraminidase at 20 mU/ml at pH 5.5 for 1 h at 378C. In contrast to virus attachment on BHK-21 cells, the binding of all four TMEVs was significantly diminished ( Figure 5 ). These results indicate that all four TMEVs attach to mucin-producing goblet cells in a SA-dependent fashion. In neuraminidase-treated sections, we sometimes detected faint residual virus binding to cells, presumably Paneth cells, near the crypt in all four TMEVs for unknown reasons (Figure 5c , f). However, because the area is not on the surface of the intestine, it is unlikely that TMEV uses these cells for entry during enteric infection.We do not know the physiologic role of SAbinding by TMEV in the intestine. Goblet cell binding by virus via SA was shown in TGEV infection (Schwegmann-Webels et al, 2003) . As was suggested in TGEV infection (Schultze et al, 1996) , binding of sialylated macromolecules may increase the stability of virions and thus facilitate survival in the gastrointestinal tract, protecting the virus from inactivation due to low pH and proteases (Krempl et al, 2000; Lipton et al, 2005) . Virus binding to mucin via SA may also allow the virus to remain longer in the intestine. This would make it easier to interact with the cellular receptor initiating intestinal infection, thus preventing the loss of virions due to intestinal peristalsis (Schwegmann-Webels et al, 2003) . In addition, because VP1 loop II and VP2 puff B of TMEV contain antibody binding sites (Tsunoda and Fujinami, 2007) , SA-binding of virus may also prevent TMEV from neutralization by antibody against TMEV in the gastrointestinal tract.In contrast, mucus is known to act as a barrier in the mucosal immune system. It regulates mucosal microbiota by secreted antibodies and mucus (Cone, 2005) . To infect the intestinal epithelium, virions must pass through the mucus blanket and glycocalyx on the gastrointestinal epithelium to reach cellular receptors on the apical surface of the epithelial cells (Schwegmann-Webels et al, 2003) . Microorganisms, including viruses, are known to be trapped by mucus. In the mucus, aggulutination and neutralization by antibodies, especially polyvalent IgA and IgM, can occur. Mucin, the primary component of the mucus layer, can also inhibit SA-dependent virus-cell attachment, resulting in suppression of virus infection (Chen et al, 1993) .Currently, we cannot explain why GDVII and DApBL2M viruses have differences in SA dependency for attachment to BHK-21 cells versus intestine tissues. Interestingly, wheat germ aggulutinin (WGA), which specifically binds to SA residues, reduces the BHK-21 cell binding of both BeAn and GDVII viruses in vitro, although neuraminidase treatment has no effect on GDVII virus binding to BHK-21 cells (Fotiadis et al, 1991; Kilpatrick and Lipton, 1991) . However, our studies using intestinal tissue as substrate in binding assays should be more relevant to what is occurring in vivo.The requirement for SA in viral attachment could also be different between the gastrointestinal tract versus the CNS. Jnaoui et al (2002) hypothesized that VP1 loop II and VP2 puff B of TMEV contact the carbohydrate moiety of the receptor, thus altering TMEV tropism and pathogenicity. They demonstrated decreased ability by two DA virus mutants, KJ6 virus with mutations in VP1 loop II and VP2 puff B and OT11 virus with mutations in VP1 loop II, to persist in the CNS. Sialyllactose inhibition studies found decreased SA usage for entry by KJ6 virus. In addition, mice infected for 6 days with GDVII virus mutant KJ38, which has three mutations in VP2 puff B and two in VP1 (VP1-51 and -195), had a dramatic decrease in the number of infected cells in the CNS compared to mice infected with wild-type GDVII virus. Sialidase treatment of cells in vitro reduced infection by KJ38 virus, indicating binding of KJ38 virus to SA.In summary, we demonstrated that DApBL2M virus, which has mutations in both VP1 loop II and VP2 puff B, showed decreased SA-binding similar to that of GDVII virus. Our results support the hypothesis that VP1 loop II and VP2 puff B form the SA-binding site, termed ''gap.'' Virus overlay assays indicated that not only DA and DApB but also GDVII and DApBL2M viruses bound to mucus, which is produced in the cell bodies of goblet cells and spreads onto the surface of epithelium, in the intestine. This attachment was dependent upon the presence of SA. Our report is the first to show that the requirement for SA in viral attachment is different among host cell types and this could lead to differences in cell tropism and disease.Declaration of interest: The authors report no conflicts of interest.

The only thing that makes me feel better\u2026 is pain. If I want to know what it's like to get hurt\u2026 I have to experience it firsthand.-LIFE (Suenobu 2002, 85, 97) After slicing her arm with a box cutter, Ayumu, a fifteen-year-old high school girl crouches on the floor, leaning against the bed. As the pent-up emotion that occupied her a moment ago wherein the stereotype of young women cutting themselves to mitigate acute negative emotion was readily prevalent and persistent (Trewavas, Hasking, and McAllister 2010) . Feminist scholars have problematized the gendered and racially-skewed representation of the \""selfinjurers\"" in popular media. Brickman (2004) contends that media portrayal of self-injurers as vulnerable young girls perpetuates the \""delicate cutter\"" myth that reproduces a patriarchal assumption of female passivity. Echoing Brickman and other feminist thinkers, Bareiss (2017) also argues that representations of self-injury in popular Hollywood films, though somewhat challenging societal norms, ultimately reinforce normative expectations of young women who self-injure to be docile and submissive.Compared to the Anglophone mediascape, little is known about how self-injury is represented in Japanese popular culture. Among many visual forms, manga 2 has become one of the most influential media outlets, due to its large and lucrative market, 3 entertainment value, affordability, and unique visual language representing internal thoughts and emotions of characters (Cohn 2010) . Manga has been instrumental in building a shared cultural space among Japanese readers, covering virtually all topics imaginable, including sports, war, corporate life, child rearing, sex, cooking, usury, and medicine. Beyond entertainment, manga plays a wide array of roles in Japanese societyfrom a teaching tool, an information source, a behaviour guide, social commentary, an agent of socialization (Ito 2005) , to a vehicle for government policy (Matanle, Ishiguro, and McCann 2014) .One notable characteristic of manga is its division of genres by gender and age. Most manga first appear as a series in comic magazines, which are grouped by their gender-based readership, namely, magazines for men (dansei-shi) and for women (josei-shi) . Each category is further divided into age-based subgenres including: sh\u014dnen manga (boy's comics targeting readers eighteen years old and younger), seinen manga (comics for young males age eighteen to thirty), seijin manga (comics for grownups), sh\u014djo manga (comics for girls eighteen years old and younger), josei manga (comics targeting young female adults age eighteen to thirty), and redicomi (\""Lady's Comic\"" for adult women). Sh\u014dnen and sh\u014djo manga targeting young readers generally refrain from explicit nudity, violence and sex, while manga for adult audiences may carry R18 content.Although Japanese consumers increasingly engage in cross-age, cross-gender readership, the gender-/age-based heterosexual marketing genres still firmly shape the styles and aesthetic of manga. For example, female characters in sh\u014djo manga tend to embody societal appearance norms, particularity girlish-cuteness (\""kawaii\"") culture typified by large staring eyes, frilly dresses, flowers, ribbons and hearts (Kinsella 1995) . Traditional gender perceptions manifest more conspicuously in boys' and men's manga, in which female characters use a stereotypical feminine speech style more frequently than has been reported for natural speech (Unser-Schutz 2015) . Working women in best-selling men's manga are typically portrayed as either excluded from careers or negatively constructed as being too masculine (Matanle, Ishiguro, and McCann 2014) . Stereotypical gendering may also occur on the creator's side, as manga authors are likely to draw for audiences of their own gender. In other words, sh\u014djo manga are generally considered as comics \""for girls, by girls,\"" while sh\u014dnen manga are comics \""for boys, by boys, about boys\"" (Unser-Schutz 2015), based on a marketing assumption about readers relating to the characters of their own gender.Like any other form of fictional literature and popular art, manga is deeply immersed in a particular social environment. It constantly reproduces dominant norms, cultural values and beliefs, including socially-embedded heteronormative gender norms and sexism, while offering readers an escape into an imaginative realm to pursue their desires and aspirations beyond the limitations set by societal norms. Indeed, what manga offers goes beyond mere escapism; via authentic depiction of a \""Japanese way of life\"" (Ito 2005) , it not only confirms social order but also challenges readers to reconsider the taken-for-granted worldviews, social hierarchy and norms. For Masuda (2015) , manga's character-based narrative allows readers to \""experience different types of the \""I\"" and \""relate to the world by simulating the characters' thoughts and relationships\"" (28) and invites readers to reassess their everyday life and explore alternative ways of being.Manga serves as a window to Japanese way of life that simultaneously conforms to and challenges societal norms and values, making this cultural artifact particularly optimal for analyzing a topic of interest in situ. While a few previous studies examined iry\u014d-kei manga (medical comics) featuring medical professionals (e.g., doctors, nurses, pharmacists) (Kishi et al. 2011; Matsuoka, Smith, and Uchimura 2011) , little has been explored about how manga depicts a public health issue such as self-injury in everyday life context. Literature on the topic of self-injury in manga is virtually nonexistent. We were able to locate one brief report (written in Japanese) by Ishige (2006) that examines self-cutting portrayed in sh\u014djo manga published between 1973-2005, along with folklore and popular songs. Looking at sh\u014djo manga featuring wrist-cutting, Ishige asserts that the meaning ascribed to self-injury has been changing over time from a suicide attempt to a coping strategy. However, although Ishige's study offers a meaningful introduction to this largely under-explored topic, the author does not provide a detailed documentation of the search strategy, analytic method, and the content of manga examined. It remains unknown as to what types of characters were depicted to engage in selfinjury and which set of meanings were associated with the act in each narrative. In addition, there seems to be a significant increase in the volume and variety of manga featuring selfinjury since Ishige's study, especially in genres other than sh\u014djo manga.The purpose of the present study was thus to examine how self-injury has been represented in Japanese manga since 2000 through a thorough exploration of character demographics, perceived functions of self-injury, and help-seeking behaviours among self-injuring characters within each manga narrative. This study also intended to expand the scope from sh\u014djo manga to encompass other types of manga targeting different audiences in terms of gender and age. Given the gendered nature of manga, one can hypothesize that boys' manga and girls' manga may differ in portraying characters who self-injure, as well as meanings ascribed to each act. Exploring the content of manga featuring self-injury thus leads to an important realization about how this mass medium constructs a perceived reality of self-injury, and in so doing, shapes public perceptions of this phenomenon."", ""Data collection"": ""To date, there is no comprehensive database for Japanese manga. The sources of data for this study were determined through various methods to enhance sampling validity. We first searched three digital databases for manga, the Japan National Diet Library's online catalogue (http://www.ndl.go.jp/), the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs' media arts digital archive (https://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp), and Kyoto International Manga Museum's Manga Repository (http://mmsearch.kyotomm.jp/index_j.html), using the term \""jish\u014d\"" (self-injury). We also consulted with librarians at six Japanese libraries with extensive manga collections.Two out of the six libraries, the Osaka Prefectural Library and the Kyoto International Manga Museum, provided us with a comprehensive list of manga that might meet our eligibility criteria below. Additionally, we sought eligible manga by conducting a Google search, visiting online communities where members discuss manga/comics, movies and books featuring selfinjury (e.g. Self-Injury.net), circulating general inquiries among our professional and personal networks, and consulting relevant literature on visual representations of self-injury.While the narrative review by Ishige (2006) covered sh\u014djo manga published between 1973-2005, 75% of the samples were published prior to 2000. Similar to what Whitlock et al. (2009) reported in their study of English movies featuring self-injury, since 2000 we have noticed a clear upward trend in the amount of manga portraying self-injury. To update and expand Ishige's work, we chose to analyze manga published between 2000 to 2017, and broadened the focus to include other marketing genres than sh\u014djo manga, such as sh\u014dnen manga, seinen manga, and Boy's Love, a subgenre of josei manga featuring homoerotic relationships between male characters. As we were most interested in depiction of self-injury in everyday life contexts, we limited our focus onto nichij\u014d-kei (\""slice-of-life\"") genre that features realistic depictions of everyday life, excluding science fiction, fantasy, picaresque romance and other genres that take place in imaginary worlds. Manga featuring overt suicide attempts and culturally sanctioned forms of self-mutilation (e.g. tattooing, body-piercing) were also excluded. As such, our sample did not include a distinct manga genre featuring Yakuza (Japanese mafia) and Yankee (gangster) subculture that frequently portray ritualistic self-injury including yubitsume (a ritual of finger amputation to atone for one's misdeed) or konj\u014d-yaki (a test of courage by burning skin with a cigarette). These self-mutilation rituals serve as staples of Yakuza/Yankee manga and movies as a sign of underground camaraderie among clan members, but did not meet our eligibility criteria.A total of fifteen manga featuring eighteen characters with explicit engagement with selfinjury were identified (see Appendix Table 4 for the list of manga analyzed). Of fifteen manga, there were eight sh\u014djo manga (Memai, Tobira, LIFE, GALS!, Mondai no nai watashitachi, Aishiteruze Baby, NANA, Tokyo Children), five seinen manga (eleGY, Last Menhera, Jisatsu Circle, G senj\u014d Heaven's Door, Onani Master Kurosawa), one josei manga (Piet\u00e0), and one Boy's Love (CUT). No sh\u014dnen manga met our eligibility criteria. 4 Each manga was further scrutinized to identify scenes depicting self-injury. In cases where self-injury appeared more than once in the story, each scene was recorded as a separate event. A total of forty scenes of self-injury were depicted among the sample with nine out of eighteen characters (50%) portrayed as engaging in self-injury more than once. The year when the scene of self-injury appeared in each manga ranged from 2000-2017, with 75% (n=30) appearing during 2000-2005."", ""Content analysis"": ""The method of content analysis was employed, combining quantitative and qualitative approaches. Informed by previous quantitative content analysis of movies featuring self-injury (Whitlock, Purington, and Gershkovich 2009; Trewavas, Hasking, and McAllister 2010) , two authors first collaboratively developed a coding rubric to capture: 1) demographic data of the characters who self-injure (i.e. gender, age, occupation, sexual orientation, whether the characters are portrayed as engaging in habitual self-injury); 2) methods of self-injury depicted (e.g., cutting, burning, hitting); 3) locations of self-injury on the body (e.g. wrist, forearm, thigh); 4) presence of other characters at the scene of self-injury; and 5) mental and/or physical health intervention after self-injury. Two authors then individually read five manga each to qualitatively analyze: 6) events that triggered self-injury; 7) degree of suicidal intent (e.g., overt, implied, none); 8) consequences of self-injury; and 9) perceived functions of self-injury. In this process, perceived functions of self-injury were determined in accordance with the antecedents and consequences implicitly and explicitly portrayed in narratives. As manga contains a complex system of symbolic meaning combining multiple visual and textual subcodes, the authors paid close attention not only to plots, characters' facial expressions and dialogues but also backgrounds (e.g., tones of the scene), onomatopoeia, frames, and characters' interior monologues implying particular meanings associated with each self-injurious act. Klonsky's (2007) seven-function model also provided a guiding framework for coding of the perceived functions. The seven functions include: affect regulation, anti-dissociation, anti-suicide, interpersonal boundaries, interpersonal influence, self-punishment, and sensation seeking.After two iterations, the coding rubric was finalized. The first author coded all forty scenes, while two trained research assistants independently coded 50% of the sample each using the final rubric to capture the aforementioned nine elements. Agreement between two coders (the first author and one of the research assistants) was on average 95%, ranging from 100% (demographic characteristics, methods of self-injury) to 82% (perceived functions of selfinjury). During the coding process, the first author and the research assistants took notes of their thought process and ensured interpretative consistency by team discussion. Discrepancies among coders were discussed until consensus was achieved. Table 1 presents the demographic attributes of eighteen characters who self-injure in the sampled manga. A salient gender difference was found in the characters, with sixteen out of eighteen characters being female (88.9%). All but one character (94.5%) were in their adolescence aged between thirteen and eighteen years old, being in high school or at junior high school. The youngest age of onset depicted in those flashback scenes is grade four (nine to ten years old). In general, characters are portrayed as heterosexual, except for two characters, the female protagonist of Piet\u00e0 (Haruno 2000) and the male protagonist of CUT (Kawayui 2003) who are depicted as in non-heterosexual romantic relationships. Characters who selfinjure tended to be main characters in the narrative (77.8% n=14) with the story unfolding through their perspectives. These characters' internal thoughts are often expressed through thought bubbles or narrations. Thirteen characters (72.2%) are portrayed as recurrently engaging in self-injury, suggested by visible scars or through flashback scenes that reveal their past history."", ""Depictions of self-injury"": ""Of the forty self-injury scenes, thirty-five (87.5%) feature graphic depictions of self-injury in action, while five scenes allude to the act through visual depictions of bleeding wounds or scars with characters' accounts or inner thoughts. Four of the forty scenes of self-injury are flashbacks in which the characters retrospectively recall their past self-injury and events that triggered the act. Of the forty scenes examined, cutting is the most prominent method (87.5%, n=35), followed by stabbing (7.5%, n=3) and burning (5%, n=2). In terms of wound locations, self-injury is performed most often on wrists (47.5%, n=19) and on arms (40%, n=16), then less frequently on thighs (5%, n=2), hands (5%, n=2) and neck (n=1). Two characters selfinjure multiple body parts (See Table 2 ). In 85% of the scenes examined (n=34), characters self-injure alone in a private space such as a bathroom or a bedroom to conceal their behaviours. In six scenes (15%), characters engage in self-injury in the presence of others (e.g., friends, families) to shock the person in presence or to express belonging to a group. In the majority of scenes examined (n=34, 85%), characters engaging in habitual self-injury feel they would be discriminated against if others discover their self-injury and thus conceal their scars with wristbands or long sleeves."", ""Functions of self-injury and interventions"": ""The perceived primary functions of self-injury vary across the forty scenes (Table 3 ). The most conspicuous is affect regulation (55%, n=22) in which self-injury is depicted as a strategy to alleviate acute negative emotion or aversive affective arousal (Klonsky, 2007) triggered by events such as bullying, friendship dissolution, conflict with family, or childhood trauma. The majority of scenes make no reference to a specific mental disorder (e.g., Borderline Personality Disorder, anxiety disorder) except for two scenes where characters are depicted as suffering from substance abuse (Memai) or depression (Tokyo Children).For some of the characters who engage in habitual self-injury, the act tended to serve a single function (e.g., coping with emotional distress) despite being triggered by different antecedents. For others with recurrent self-injury, the meaning associated with self-injury varies depending on the motivation at the time, the relationship with the others in presence, and the frame of reference drawn to interpret the act. For example, a young female protagonist of Tobira (Momochi 2002 ) engages in self-cutting twice through the story; the first time is to express a blood oath of friendship with her classmate who habitually self-injures, and the second time is to attempt suicide in front of her mother. The protagonist, Manatsu, flexibly interprets self-injury first as a gesture of social bonding, then as a means to communicate her suicidality to her mother.In most scenes analyzed (75%, n=30), self-injury is portrayed as independent from suicidal thoughts or behaviour. In Last Menhera, for example, the protagonist Sumire describes her recurrent self-cutting as a way of \""enduring the pain of living\"" (Amano and Ise 2016, 56), rather than terminating her life. In five scenes (12.5%) characters are depicted as having overt or implied suicidal intent. Among these scenes three characters attempt suicide by wristcutting, while two attempt suicide by jumping or intoxication in addition to cutting.In four scenes (10%), characters engage in self-injury to punish or invalidate themselves. This tendency is particularly salient in LIFE (Suenobu, 2002 (Suenobu, -2009 20 volumes) quoted at the beginning of this article. The protagonist, Ayumu, is portrayed as shy and introverted, engaging in recurrent self-cutting as she feels she \""does not deserve\"" to be happy (Suenobu 2002, 97) . In two scenes (5%), characters injure themselves in a dissociative state. For example, in Piet\u00e0 (Haruno 2000), the protagonist, Rio (a female high school student), is portrayed as cutting herself after having a flashback nightmare of her vicious stepmother. She is depicted as though not noticing her self-cutting until blood is dripping on the kitchen floor. Regaining a sense of self, Rio sinks on the floor with her arms wrapped around knees, faintly murmuring \""Help\"" (19).The majority of characters are not in any form of psychiatric treatment when engaging in self-injury. With respect to consequences of self-injury, in twenty-nine of forty scenes "", ""Functions"": ""Affect regulation 22 (55%) Interpersonal influence 6 (15%) Suicide Attempt 5 (12.5%) Self-punishment 4 (10%) Anti-dissociation 2 (5%) Hallucination-driven 1 (2.5%) InterventionsNone 29 (72.5%) Unspecified 6 (15%) Home first aid 3 (7.5%) Hospitalization 1 (2.5%) Psychological treatment 1 (2.5%) examined (72.5%), self-injury does not result in any treatment or intervention. Six scenes (15%) were categorized as \""unspecified\"" because these scenes depict either the character recalling a past self-injury episode, or the story stops right at the moment of self-injury then leaps to a few days/months later with no reference to whether a treatment or intervention was offered to the character. There is little direct depiction of mental health treatment provided to characters after self-injury, except for one manga (Tobira) in which the mother of the protagonist saw a psychiatrist for advice after her daughter's wrist-cutting. In terms of informal support, ten characters (55.6%) receive support from partners and friends, while parents and siblings seldom served as a source of support. The reactions of partners and close friends tended to be empathetic and contributing to the characters' recovery from self-injury, while parents, siblings and distant peers (e.g., classmates) are shown to be indifferent or react aversively to the character. In some of the manga examined, family members are portrayed as a direct trigger of self-injury. For example, in Mondai no nai watashitachi (Kimura and Ushida 2003, 3 volumes), a high school girl, Midori, faces constant pressure from her mother to succeed in school, marry a rich man, and take the mother out of her unhappy marriage. Midori feels distressed by the selfish dream that her mother imposes upon her and engages in recurrent self-injury until she meets the story's protagonist Mio at school and receives emotional support. An emergent conceptualization of self-injury was also observed. While self-injury itself does not serve a distinct identity label (i.e., no character is called a \""wrist-cutter\"" or \""selfinjurer\""), in two seinen manga (eleGY, Last Menhera) published in 2012 and after, female characters who self-injure are coined \""menhera\"" (a derivation of \""mental health-er,\"" a person with mental instability) 5 by other characters or superimposed texts. In both manga, the menhera girls are depicted as isolated, mentally unstable, and highly dependent on male protagonists who are interested in having a romantic/sexual relationship with them. The female protagonist Sumire in Last Menhera (Amano and Ise 2016) also engages in promiscuous sexual activity to combat feelings of emptiness until developing a stable relationship with the male protagonist."", ""Discussion"": ""The current study aimed to offer a close reading of scenes in Japanese manga featuring selfinjury. We explored how self-injury has been represented in Japanese manga since 2000, focusing on self-injuring characters, the perceived functions of the behaviour, as well as the presence and absence of help-seeking among the characters. Results indicate that manga's depiction of self-injury are largely congruent with previous research on self-injury in English films (Whitlock, Purington, and Gershkovich 2009; Trewavas, Hasking, and McAllister 2010; Bareiss 2017 ), in which characters who self-injure are predominantly heterosexual female in their late teens, engaging in habitual self-cutting. Although there are a few male self-injuring characters, the gendered perspective still permeates the sampled manga.Likewise, functions of self-injury mirror those identified in previous studies and clinical research (e.g., Klonsky 2007; Klonsky et al. 2015) . Most characters who self-injure are portrayed as using self-injury as a strategy to cope with negative emotions, punish themselves, or interrupt a dissociative episode rather than as an act of suicide attempt. In two of five scenes in which characters are depicted to have overt or implied suicide intent, wrist-cutting is used in combination with more lethal methods such as jumping and intoxication, implying perceived low lethality of wrist-cutting. In alignment with Ishige's (2006) observation that wrist-cutting no longer signals suicidal ideation in the post-1980 manga, this finding indicates that while the depiction of wrist-cutting may still evoke a traditional cultural reading that connects the act with suicidal intent, the interpretation of habitual wrist-cutting as a coping mechanism to endure \""the pain of living\"" (Amano and Ise 2016) may be increasingly incorporated into the Japanese popular cultural imagination. Given that research indicates habitual engagement in self-injury elevates suicide risk and provides a \""gateway\"" for suicide (Whitlock et al. 2013) , potential implications of this interpretation warrants caution.There is a general lack of help-seeking among self-injuring characters. Across the forty scenes examined, self-injury is portrayed as a stigmatized behaviour that makes the characters feel ashamed, and they conceal their behaviours and scars from others. However, more than half of the characters who self-injure eventually receive emotional support from significant others who help them recover from habitual self-injury. While a similar finding was reported in a previous study in which self-injuring characters receive informal support from friends and family (Trewavas, Hasking, and McAllister 2010) , in the present study the sources of support are primarily romantic partners and close friends; reaction by families, parents in particular, to the self-injuring characters tend to be unsupportive and aversive, or even triggering, like the mother in Mondai no nai watashitachi (Kimura and Ushida 2001-2003) who desires to use her daughter to compensate for her unhappy life. In such a context, character's self-injury is portrayed as a form of resistance against repressive parental domination, similar to Bareiss's (2017) analysis of films featuring self-injuring girls. In addition, the absence of parental support for self-injury can also be explained by the prevalence of a bildungsroman theme in both sh\u014dnen and sh\u014djo manga, in which conflict with parental figures often serve as a catalyst for self-actualization for young characters.In a related vein, we observed two contrasting perspectives toward young girls who selfinjure. On one hand, in sh\u014djo manga, characters who self-injure are primarily protagonists of the narrative, whose internal struggles and causes of self-injury are delineated with extensive detail from a first person point of view. As sh\u014djo manga serve young female readers as \""a model for reality\"" (Masuda 2015) , these manga may invite readers to walk through life struggles with the protagonists and frame self-injury as a maladaptive but understandable response to contemporary pressures placed upon young girls. The depiction of self-injury as a gesture of friendship or group membership also reflects the female characters' desire for escaping from parental control and belonging instead to a group of peers who accept them.On the other hand, seinen manga aimed at adult male readers portray girls who self-injure from the perspective of male protagonists. Of particular interest is the emergence of \""menhera\"" characters in two seinen manga published since 2012, in which male protagonists are attracted to menhera girls who exhibited mental instability, fear of abandonment and insecure romantic attachments. For these menhera girls, self-injury is not just an act of affect regulation but also an identity label that shapes their role in the narrative. The menhera character can be seen as a twisted variant of the damsel in distress, a classic narrative trope in literature that involves young, attractive, and helpless mistresses waiting to be rescued by a hero. They were placed in a predicament not by a monster or a villain but by mental illness that makes them prone to risky behaviour such as self-injury or sexual promiscuity. Contrary to characters that self-injure in sh\u014djo manga, these menhera girls are clearly subjected to the male gaze that objectifies and fetishizes the female self-injured body, while attention is deflected from underlying causes of self-injury. Although it may be too na\u00efve to believe that readers take such a portrayal at face value, this fetishized gaze toward menhera girls nonetheless provides its overwhelmingly male readers with a highly gendered interpretive repertoire. An inquiry into these two contrasting views would make a valuable contribution to the understanding of public perception on mental illness in Japan.Furthermore, it would be meaningful for future work to explore depictions of subcultural and ritualistic self-injury in manga for male readers, particularly those themed Yakuza (Japanese mafia) and Yankee (gangster) that were excluded from the current study. In their content analysis of English films, Trewavas, Hasking, and McAllister (2010) report that male characters who self-injure engage in more diverse methods of self-injury than females. Exploring subculturally sanctioned body mutilations in sh\u014dnen, seinen and seijin manga targeting male readership may imply how these self-injuries have distinctive meaning in Japanese popular culture in contrast to the pathologized and highly gendered portrayal of self-injury explored in this study. In this process, applying a critical gender lens to these representations would substantially enrich future investigation. Moreover, future exploration into self-published doujinshi (indie comics) and web comics with self-injuring characters would further expand this field of inquiry. With the advancement of indie comic markets and self-publishing online tools, Japanese readers are increasingly exposed to less filtered and more direct depictions of violence and human suffering including self-injury, suicide, and other mental health issues. This line of research could analyze how this emergent subculture represents self-injury in comparison with mainstream manga, focusing particularly on the \""menhera\"" characters and on unique behavioural and affective attributes they embody.The current findings have several implications for future research and intervention of selfinjury. First, manga has been deeply embedded in contemporary Japanese society to the extent that its power to shape public understanding of mental health issues cannot be underestimated. Manga representations of self-injury examined in this study offer a complex commentary on self-injury and have likely influenced, to varying degrees, readers' perceptions of how people who self-injure could be like and should be treated. As manga is considered providing young readers \""textbooks for living\"" (Masuda 2015, 28) , some readers may turn to these manga to make sense of their own engagement in self-injury. The portrayal of emotional support from partners and close friends observed in this study may induce a sense of hope among readers who self-injure, while reducing the feeling of social isolation commonly reported by youth engaging in self-injury (Whitlock et al. 2013) . Meanwhile, the general absence of support from family (parents in particular) found in this study is concerning, because this tendency may perpetuate existing stigma associated with self-injury and promote the vilification of parents.Second, actual impacts of manga on readers should be examined in future research. Although there is as yet no empirical evidence if exposure to the portrayal of self-injury in manga (and popular media in general) may induce contagion, 6 researchers have addressed concern that recurrent exposure to fictional/non-fictional self-injury stories may result in narrative reinforcement (Whitlock, Purington, and Gershkovich 2009) , which, for better or worse, justify self-injury related behavioural choices. Indeed, remarkably little has been written about the positive therapeutic potential of manga for readers with mental health issues. Researching further into how readers of different types interpret manga and the potential use of manga in treating people who self-injure may provide a new avenue into improving support to those engaging in self-injury.Finally, the present study makes a unique contribution to the emergent study of graphic medicine (Williams 2012 ) by illuminating how the medium of comic can be used to understand subjective experience of self-injury. For readers residing in other countries than Japan, the current study findings may be of particularly salience, as they offer an interesting window into a unique cultural interpretation of self-injury in Japan and suggest the potential of crosscultural exploration into cultural attitudes toward self-injury and related mental health issues.Given the increasing visibility of Japanese popular media including manga in international markets (Ito 2010) , much more work could be done in this area, including the academic appraisal of manga representations of mental health in and outside Japan, and how such manga are perceived by Japanese and non-Japanese audiences.1 Promoting this line of definition, a group of psychiatrists and researchers proposed a term \""non-suicidal selfinjury (NSSI)\"" to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5 criteria (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Although NSSI did not become a standalone, formal diagnosis, the term is now widely used among the clinical community allowing clinicians to treat self-injury as a mental illness. Critical scholars of health such as Amy Chandler (2014) voiced concern over how this trend towards pathologization would impact individual and public understandings of self-injury. 2 Although the history of Japanese manga can date back to the seventh century (Ito 2005) , in this article manga refers to modern Japanese graphic novels popularized after World War II that combines traditional Japanese iconography with American cartoon and cinematic techniques. Fredrik Schodt's seminal book Manga! Manga!: The World of Japanese Comics (1986) provides a comprehensive overview of the history of Japanese manga until the 1980s. Kinko Ito's chapter (2005) also provides a succinct summary of Japanese manga history from ancient times to the early twenty-first century. It is worth noting here that this article uses the term \""manga\"" both as a singular and a plural noun. 3 A 2018 report by the All Japan Magazine and Book Publishers and Editors Association (AJPEA)'s 2018 estimated the total sales of the manga industry in 2017 (physical and digital platforms combined) as 433 billion yen (equivalent to $3.92 billion USD), which generated nearly double the revenues of the local film industry (228 billion yen, Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan, 2018). Although sales of print manga have been declining since the mid-1990s, the rise of denshi comic (digital comics) kept the market afloat. Manga also plays a vital role in Japan's \""media mix,\"" a character-based marketing strategy to distribute content across multiple media platforms (Ito 2010) . Popular manga series often provide characters and plots for other platforms such as anime (animation), games, films, TV dramas, advertising and even political campaigns that together establish manga's pervasive presence in Japanese cultural landscape. 4 There are two potential explanations that may account for the absence of sh\u014dnen manga. First, in sh\u014dnen manga, slice-of-life genre is popular, but not as dominant as in other genre (e.g., sh\u014djo manga). Self-injury depicted as happening in imaginary worlds did not meet this study's inclusion criteria. Second, when sh\u014dnen manga portray self-injurious behaviours, the acts tend to take a form of physical aggression against objects, rather than aggression against oneself. For example, it is a common scene among sh\u014dnen and seinen manga wherein a male protagonist punches a wall or window, damages the object, and consequently hurts himself. Such a portrayal did not meet the study definition of self-injury being a deliberate hurting of one's body, because the injury is the consequence, rather than the purpose of the act. As pointed out by one reviewer, the absence of sh\u014dnen manga in our sample may also suggest a gendered understanding of self-injury penetrating Japanese popular culture. Future research focusing on gender difference in the depiction of aggressive behaviours among Japanese manga would provide further insight. 5 The term \""menhera\"" spawned from a mental health discussion board on 2-channel (2-chan), a Japanese massive anonymous online forum. Although the term was originally used by people struggling mental health issues to address themselves, it increasingly carries negative, derogatory connotations in Japanese popular culture. 6 In Japan, potential psychological and behavioural impacts of manga on readers, especially adolescents and young adults, have long been the topic of contested debate. Violent and sexually explicit expressions in manga for young readership came under recurrent critique by parent associations, school authorities, and policy makers who insisted manga has harmful impact on children. Most recently in 2010, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government tried to ban the sexually explicit expression in manga and anime through the revision of the Tokyo Metropolitan Youth Healthy Development Ordinance. The Ordinance was amended to extend the definition of \""harmful content\"" to include \""hijitsuzai seish\u014dnen\"" (non-existent youth). Facing massive protest from writers and publishers, this proposal removed 'non-existent youth' and received approval by the Metropolitan Assembly in December 2010 (Asahi Shimbun 2010) ""}",Self-Injury in Japanese Manga: A Content Analysis,"This study explored representations of self-injury in Japanese manga (graphic novels). A content analysis of fifteen slice-of-life manga published between 2000-2017 was conducted, focusing on forty scenes that depict eighteen characters engaging in self-injury. Most depictions of self-injury reflect a stereotypical perception of “self-injurer,” a young girl cutting herself to cope with negative emotion. Characters receive informal support from friends and partners, while parents are portrayed as unsupportive and even triggering. An emergent trend was observed among manga targeting male readers to label self-injuring women as “menhera” - mentally vulnerable damsels in distress - inviting a fetishistic gaze on the self-injuring female bodies.",10.1007/s10912-019-09602-9,PMC,PMC7223484,31919708.0,no-cc,2020-01-10,J Med Humanit,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223484/,2020.0,paper

As of 17 June 2010, more than 214 countries had reported confirmed cases of infection with pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus, including at least 18,156 deaths [3] . Unlike seasonal influenza, in which hospitalizations occur among patients younger than 2 and older than 65 years, or in those with underlying diseases [4] , this novel virus affected otherwise healthy young and middle-aged adults and obese individuals [2, 5] . Patients with previous respiratory disease, immunocompromised hosts and pregnant women were affected as frequently as with seasonal influenza [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Although a mild form of the disease was prevalent, it soon became evident that the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus could also provoke severe, acute respiratory failure requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilation [16] , which was reflected in the severe pathological injury found at autopsy [17] .The Argentinian population was greatly affected during the pandemic, with a total of 1,390,566 cases of influenza-like illness requiring 14,034 hospitalizations. Of the 11,746 confirmed cases of patients infected with the new strain, 617 died [18] . This represents a death rate per infection of 4.3% in hospitalized cases; an intermediate figure compared to 3.6% in Brazil, 1.2% in Chile, and approximately 6% in Uruguay, Colombia and Venezuela [19] . It should be noted that these numbers reflect great uncertainty, particularly with regard to case diagnosis. Lack of testing of mild disease and difficulties due to laboratory overload have also been well described [15, 20] . These general problems have been acknowledged by experts [21] .The severity of disease was rapidly perceived by health authorities and scientific societies. Hence, a committee of experts of the Argentinian Society of Intensive Care Medicine decided to focus on the most acutely ill patients: those presenting with diffuse viral pneumonitis requiring mechanical ventilation. They designed an epidemiological study, recently-published, to determine risk factors and outcomes [15] ; this is one of many series up to the present that have described epidemiological and clinical aspects of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .There remains, however, a paucity of data published on physiological evolution during ICU stay [22] . This present study, concurrently planned with the first by the same committee of experts, thus aims to provide such information. Our objectives were: first, to characterize alterations of oxygenation, respiratory mechanics and the use of mechanical ventilation; second, to explore compliance with protective lung ventilation; and, finally, to assess the evolution of laboratory findings and organ dysfunctions throughout the course of the disease."", ""Materials and methods"": ""This was a multicenter, inception cohort study that included patients aged > 15 years admitted to the ICU with a previous history of influenza-like illness, evolving to acute respiratory failure that required mechanical ventilation during the 2009 winter in the Southern Hemisphere. These patients had confirmed or probable disease caused by the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus and were included in the Registry of Cases of the Argentinian Society of Intensive Care Medicine (SATI), created to characterize local aspects of the pandemic. On 27 June 2009, a form to collect online epidemiological data was posted on the official SATI website. A detailed description and analysis of this information was recently published [14] .There was also an optional, more comprehensive casereport form to complete, developed by experts of the SATI's Respiratory Committee for recording certain prespecified variables throughout ICU stay, which included mechanical ventilation (MV), respiratory mechanics, oxygenation, blood chemistry and organ failure variables. This information was collected over 10 days and is analyzed in the present study.Patients were characterized as confirmed, probable or possible cases of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) [20] according to the findings in the respiratory samples collected on admission. Some specimens, however, were not analyzed because laboratories soon became overloaded, especially at the beginning of the pandemic. As of 25 September 2009, the weekly update of the Ministry of Health reported that in patients \u22655 years with influenzalike illness, the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus had displaced other respiratory viruses in 93.4% of the samples processed [23, 24] . As a result of this, probable and suspected cases were considered as caused by the novel virus and were so included in the study.We collected dates of hospital and ICU admission, and of MV onset; demographics; risk factors for influenza A; actual weight; height; severity of illness (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II, APACHE II), organ failures (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, SOFA); type of MV used, as noninvasive (NIV) and invasive; and date of intubation. Ideal body weight (IBW, ml/kg) and body mass index (BMI) were calculated; obesity was defined as a BMI > 30.At MV onset (Day 0) and on Days 3, 7 and 10, until death or discharge, whichever occurred first, we recorded: (1) MV-related variables. (2) MV modes: volume-controlled ventilation (VCV); pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV); bilevel mode; pressure support ventilation (PSV); other. (3) Tidal volume (Vt, in ml/kg of IBW) (4) Pressures: peak, plateau pressures, total positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and driving pressure (plateau pressure -PEEP), in cmH2O. The main outcome measure was hospital mortality; secondary outcomes were length of MV, of ICU (LOSICU) and of hospital (LOSHOSP) stays.In case of missing observations, local study coordinators were contacted to provide the corresponding values. Proportions were calculated as percentages of existing data.No assumptions for missing data were made."", ""Statistical analysis"": ""Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data were analyzed for the entire population; for the subgroups of survivors vs. non-survivors; and for patients receiving NIV on admission vs. those who did not. Descriptive statistics used were: mean \u00b1 standard deviations (SD) and median and 25-75% interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous data of normal and non-normal distribution, respectively; and percentages for categorical data. Differences between subgroups were analyzed with unpaired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Chi-square tests, as appropriate. A P-value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. A Kaplan-Meier curve was constructed to evaluate survival over the follow-up period. Over time, normally distributed data were analyzed with two-way repeated measures of ANOVA. At the pre-specified time points, differences within the entire group and subgroups, and between subgroups, were tested using paired and unpaired t tests, respectively.In non-normally distributed data, differences over time within the entire group and the subgroups were analyzed with Friedman's and Wilcoxon tests. Comparisons between subgroups at the pre-specified time points were tested with Mann-Whitney U test. The Bonferroni correction was used to adjustments for multiple comparisons.The local Institutional Review Boards waived the need for informed consent, given the general lack of knowledge on the clinical and outcome characteristics of the ongoing pandemic and to the non-interventional study design."", ""Results"": ""General characteristics (Table 1) Between 6 June and 28 August 2009, the SATI's online Registry included 337 patients admitted to 35 ICUs with confirmed/probable/possible diffuse viral pneumonitis caused by influenza A (H1N1), with acute respiratory failure requiring MV (14) . Of these, 178 consecutive patients admitted to 20 ICUs were followed over time, and are presented in this study. To address any potential concern that unconfirmed cases could belong to a different population of patients, we performed a sensitivity analysis of clinical and outcome characteristics data after exclusion of these patients. The results of this analysis did not differ from those of the primary assessments, so the 178 patients are considered for evaluation.Briefly, patients were middle-aged, with no gender preponderance; they had a history of symptoms of nearly one-week duration and were ventilated at 1 [0 to -2] day after hospital admission. Pre-existent respiratory diseases, obesity, and diseases causing immunosuppression were the most frequent comorbid conditions; and prevalence of pregnancy was higher than in the general population, as expected [25] . Non-survivors were sicker on admission; duration of previous symptoms was longer; and organ failures were more severe. Obesity and immunosuppression were significantly more frequent as predisposing conditions. Ninety-three patients survived (52%) (See Figure 1 ). (Table 2) During the study period, the entire group had Vt values between 7.8 to 8.1 ml/kg of IBW, with plateau pressures remaining always < 30 cmH 2 O. Non-survivors displayed a trend towards lower Vt and higher plateau pressures, which differed significantly from survivors only at Day 7. Intermediate PEEP levels were used, and decreased in survivors from Day 3 onwards. Driving pressures were similar over time in all patients; only at admission did non-survivors exhibit higher values. PaO 2 /FIO 2 increased significantly over time in all patients and in survivors. It remained, however, < 200 in the whole group throughout the entire ICU stay due to non-survivor values. Non-survivors displayed significantly lower PaO 2 /FIO 2 at all time points."", ""Clinical and mechanical ventilation-related variables"": ""Lung infiltrates (in quadrants) peaked at day 3 (3.1 \u00b1 1.0 vs. 2.9 \u00b1 1 at Day 0, P < 0.01) and then decreased during the study in the entire group, especially at Day 10 (2.8 \u00b1 1.1, P < 0.83 vs. Day 0), which reflected the improvement in survivors (3.1 \u00b1 1.0 at Day 3 vs. 2.9 \u00b1 1.0 at Day 10, P < 0.01).In Figure 2 , the utilization of ventilation modes and rescue therapies in the entire group are shown. Briefly, PCV use equaled VCV at Day 10, preceded by deterioration in oxygenation and respiratory mechanics: PaO 2 / FIO 2 78 \u00b1 24 vs. 128 \u00b1 33, (P = 0.03); PaCO 2 44 \u00b1 4 vs. 35 \u00b1 3 mmHg (P = 0.04); pH 7.29 \u00b1 0.03 vs. 7.39 \u00b1 0.05 (P = 0.05), and plateau pressures of 30 \u00b1 2 vs. 25 \u00b1 3 cmH 2 O (P = 0.03). Recruitment maneuvers became significantly more common in non-survivors at Day 3 (46%, vs. 29% in survivors; P = 0.03), as did prone positioning (24%, vs. 14%; P = 0.001). After that, only prone positioning remained significantly more used in nonsurvivors (at Day 7: 38%; vs. 14%, P = 0.004; and at Day 10: 25%; vs. 5%, P = 0.02). Six patients received tracheal gas insufflation; only one survived. Neuromuscular blockers were prescribed in 18% of patients on admission; and their use was subsequently more frequent in non-survivors (Day 3: 14% vs. 8%, P = 0.02; and Day 7: 14% vs. 8%, P = 0.04).The main causes of death were refractory hypoxemia (64%); followed by multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (15%) and shock (10%). Prolonged mechanical ventilation and long ICU and hospital stays were frequent (Table 1) . Tracheostomy was performed in 29 patients (16%) at Day 14 [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Acid-base variables and fluid balance (Table 3) Arterial pH increased over time in the whole cohort and in both subgroups, perhaps secondary to general resuscitation measures. Despite this, non-survivors displayed significantly lower pH at all time points, owing to changes in base excess on Days 0 and 3, and to pCO 2 elevations thereafter. Respiratory rates remained unchanged, only increasing at Day 10 in non-survivors; nevertheless, this corresponded to the highest pCO 2 values, indicating the more severe respiratory compromise. Bicarbonate paralleled pH behavior. Changes in fluid balance did not show clear trends: only at Day 10 they decreased significantly, expressing survivors' behavior."", ""Use of noninvasive ventilation (Tables 4 and 5)"": ""Forty-nine patients (28%) underwent a trial of NIV on admission; they were significantly less ill and had a lower incidence of immunosuppression. Oxygenation and outcome variables were similar to those of patients not receiving NIV.Sixty-one percent of patients (n = 30) receiving NIV survived; duration of NIV was of 8 (2 to 18) hours. There were no differences between survivors and nonsurvivors in the duration of the procedure, or in the type of interface or respirator used. Of note, most patients on NIV (46 out of 49; 94%) had to be intubated and ventilated invasively for hypoxemic failure. Characteristics associated to NIV success/failure are shown in Table 5 .NIV was also used for treating post-extubation respiratory failure in 12 of 178 patients (7%), with success (reintubation not needed) in 8 cases (66%)."", ""Blood chemistry and organ failures"": ""The most consistent changes over time were found in platelet count, which increased significantly in the whole cohort (P < 0.000 for Days 3, 7 and 10 vs. Day 0), secondary to elevations in survivors. At all time points, platelets differed between survivors and non-survivors. Conversely, white blood cell count showed a progressive Creatine-kinase and markers of liver injury (alanine/ aspartate aminotransferases, serum bilirubin; not shown) were mildly elevated and displayed no substantial changes. On the contrary, lactate-dehydrogenase levels were significantly higher in non-survivors throughout the study. Creatinine levels were stable over the period, but were significantly higher in non-survivors on Days 0 and 3. Finally, SOFA score diminished over time in all patients (P < 0.000 for Days 7 and 10 vs. Day 0), as a result of the decrease in survivors. SOFA was significantly lower in survivors throughout the study.In Figure 3 , the differences between survivors and non-survivors are displayed."", ""Discussion"": ""We report on a large, prospective cohort of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) patients that were mechanically ventilated for acute respiratory failure due to diffuse pneumonitis during the pandemic in Argentina. Though most were middle-aged, previously healthy adults, patients with preexistent lung disease, immunosuppression, obesity and pregnancy were also affected. Mortality was high and evolution to chronic critical illness was common, as shown by prolonged mechanical ventilation, high needs of tracheostomy, and lengthened ICU and hospital stays.Patients had characteristically a history of protracted symptoms and displayed severe compromise of oxygenation compatible with ARDS throughout the study period, which only improved in survivors. At all time points, PaO 2 /FIO 2 differed significantly between survivors and non-survivors, requiring higher FIO 2 and PEEP in this last subgroup. Yet the levels of applied PEEP were only in the intermediate range, similar to mean values of 8.7 cmH 2 O of PEEP in an international study on mechanical ventilation [26] , which may explain the relatively high FIO 2 used in our study. Driving pressures were similar in both subgroups most of the time, suggesting an intention to limit alveolar excursion as part of a protective strategy.It is striking that, as has been described in similar studies on mechanical ventilation performed during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic [6, 7] , tidal volumes used were between 7.5 and 8.3 ml/kg IBW, certainly higher than the 6 ml/kg demonstrated as being lungprotective [27] . Indeed, barriers to implementing lowtidal volume have been identified and might explain physician behavior [28] . Despite this, plateau pressures did remain below 30 cmH 2 O [29] , indicating that lung compliance might have been preserved. Perhaps clinicians focused on plateau pressures rather than on tidal volumes [30] since it still remains unclear which should be limited to avoid ventilator-induced lung injury [31] . We, like others [6, 7, 32, 33] , could not find differences in utilized tidal volumes between survivors and non-survivors. Even so, non-survivors tended to display lower values, probably reflecting physician efforts to intensify protective ventilation strategies in the most severely compromised. Some researchers [34, 35] have suggested that allowing higher tidal volumes in a population of young and previously healthy patients with strong ventilatory drive might reveal an attempt to restrain heavy sedation and neuromuscular blocker use. Notwithstanding this, we believe that these findings may also represent clinicians' inadequate prescription, as described in other scenarios [36] .Not unexpectedly, VCV was the most common ventilator mode used. PCV use increased throughout the study period, peaking at Day 10. This is in contrast with the recently identified trend towards decreased PCV utilization. Transition to PCV mode was associated with preceding physiological worsening, so clinicians might have perceived PCV utilization as part of a global lungprotective strategy [37] .Refractory hypoxemia was the main cause of death. As in other studies [6, 7, 11] , rescue therapies were frequently applied, with utilization highest 72 hours after admission. Recruitment maneuvers and prone positioning were the primary adjuvants utilized; ECMO and HFOV are currently not available in Argentina. A Table 3 Oxygenation and acid-base variables, and fluid balance in all patients, and in survivors and non-survivors. prolonged mechanical ventilation course was frequent as reported elsewhere [6] . NIV was the first ventilation approach in 28% of cases, with 94% later requiring invasive ventilation, as has been documented in other studies [6, 7, 11] . These common experiences should caution against delaying proper ventilatory support in this group, given that rapid deterioration is common. A recent meta-analysis suggests that NIV does not decrease the need for intubation, so evidence to support its use in severe ARDS is questionable [38] . In our study, improved outcomes with NIV could be due to milder disease, evidenced by APACHE II. The small number of patients that were not intubated precludes a statistical analysis; however, they were younger, with less severe disease and better oxygenation.Significant changes in fluid balance were late and reflected changes in survivors. Negative fluid balances could never be obtained, perhaps suggesting a continuing need for hemodynamic support: 72% of patients presented with shock [14] . On the whole, fluid balances remained between those achieved by \""liberal\"" and \""conservative\"" strategies of the fluids and catheters treatment trial, depending on the day evaluated [39] . Thus far, it is not clear whether the negative fluid balance has a causal role in improving outcome in ALI/ARDS, or if it simply expresses the global recovery of patients.Another important finding was that arterial pH consistently and significantly differed between survivors and non-survivors, as described elsewhere [40, 41] . During the first 72 hours acidosis had a major metabolic component, likely as a sign of hemodynamic impairment. After the first week, respiratory acidosis ensued, indicating either the effects of protective ventilation, or merely deterioration due to progressive shunt, profound ventilation/perfusion mismatch and increased deadspace.With respect to blood chemistry, the usual findings of thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis and mildly elevated creatine-kinase blood levels were present [21, 42] . Regrettably, the lymphocyte count was not recorded. In viral infections, thrombocytopenia occurred frequently. Although the mechanisms by which the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus causes thrombocytopenia are unknown, its lack of resolution is a marker of poor prognosis. Both leukocytosis and leucopenia have been found in hospitalized patients with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) [2, 43] ; in our study, persistent leukocytosis was associated with increased mortality. LDH elevations have been previously described in fatal cases [2] , which corresponded to our finding of higher LDH levels in non-survivors at all time points. Such elevations have also been reported in seasonal influenza [44] . In experimental studies, increased LDH is a marker of human fetal membrane cell apoptosis induced by influenza virus [45] . Finally, multiorgan failure was frequent, and predictably more severe in non-survivors.This study has several strengths: first, the clinical characteristics and time course of pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) are thoroughly described and analyzed. Second, data were collected prospectively in consecutive patients and with a standardized casereporting form, representing a large, nationwide cohort. Third, temporal patterns of mechanical ventilation use, acid-base and blood chemistry variables, as well as fluid balance and organ failures, are carefully analyzed. Prognostic implications are highlighted. Finally, we present the largest experience with NIV use during the pandemic.Study limitations include the focus on mechanically ventilated patients, excluding less severe cases also admitted to the ICU. Many cases could not be confirmed because laboratories were overwhelmed with clinical samples, which is also described elsewhere [7, 14] . Data about transmission to healthcare workers were not recorded, especially regarding NIV. Currently, most information about its use during an epidemic relies upon expert opinion [46] ."", ""Conclusions"": ""In 178 patients with diffuse viral pneumonitis caused by the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus admitted to the ICU and followed over time, ARDS was the rule, requiring high ventilation support and frequent use of rescue therapies. Death, organ failures, and evolution to prolonged mechanical ventilation were common. In most cases, noninvasive ventilation failed to prevent endotracheal intubation.

Here we describe the evolution of the respiratory compromise, ventilatory management and laboratory variables of patients with diffuse viral pneumonitis caused by pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) admitted to the ICU. METHOD: This was a multicenter, prospective inception cohort study including adult patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) admitted to 20 ICUs in Argentina between June and September of 2009 during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. In a standard case-report form, we collected epidemiological characteristics, results of real-time reverse-transcriptase--polymerase-chain-reaction viral diagnostic tests, oxygenation variables, acid-base status, respiratory mechanics, ventilation management and laboratory tests. Variables were recorded on ICU admission and at days 3, 7 and 10. RESULTS: During the study period 178 patients with diffuse viral pneumonitis requiring MV were admitted. They were 44 ± 15 years of age, with Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores of 18 ± 7, and most frequent comorbidities were obesity (26%), previous respiratory disease (24%) and immunosuppression (16%). Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) was applied in 49 (28%) patients on admission, but 94% were later intubated. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was present throughout the entire ICU stay in the whole group (mean PaO(2)/FIO(2 )170 ± 25). Tidal-volumes used were 7.8 to 8.1 ml/kg (ideal body weight), plateau pressures always remained < 30 cmH(2)O, without differences between survivors and non-survivors; and mean positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels used were between 8 to 12 cm H(2)O. Rescue therapies, like recruitment maneuvers (8 to 35%), prone positioning (12 to 24%) and tracheal gas insufflation (3%) were frequently applied. At all time points, pH, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase assay (LDH) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) differed significantly between survivors and non-survivors. Lack of recovery of platelet count and persistence of leukocytosis were characteristic of non-survivors. Mortality was high (46%); and length of MV was 10 (6 to 17) days. CONCLUSIONS: These patients had severe, hypoxemic respiratory failure compatible with ARDS that persisted over time, frequently requiring rescue therapies to support oxygenation. NIV use is not warranted, given its high failure rate. Death and evolution to prolonged mechanical ventilation were common outcomes. Persistence of thrombocytopenia, acidosis and leukocytosis, and high LDH levels found in non-survivors during the course of the disease might be novel prognostic findings.",10.1186/cc10369,PMC,PMC3387643,21849039.0,cc-by,2011-08-17,Crit Care,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3387643/,2011.0,paper

SARS is a highly communicable, and often lethal, illness thought to be caused by a novel type of coronavirus Ksiazek et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003) , a group of positive, single-stranded RNA viruses known to infect domestic birds and mammals, including humans. The origin of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been the subject of much speculation. One of the leading hypotheses is that SARS-CoV is a hybrid strain (Enserink, 2003) , since there are reports of recombination in avian coronaviruses (Lee and Jackwood, 2000) , however, until a recent report in this journal (Rest and Mindell, 2003) , there was no evidence that SARS-CoV is a recombinant. Our analysis of this question, completed at the time of publication of the Rest and Mindell paper, differs from their work in the choice of methods, the extent of the genome analyzed, taxon sampling, and in the analysis of nucleotides rather than amino acids. Our results act to both corroborate and extend their findings, adding further support to the idea that SARS has had a recombinant history involving different coronavirus lineages and suggest the possibility that the genome could have arisen through a combination of host jumping and recombination events in a manner analogous to previous outbreaks of influenzae (Gregory et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 1999) ."", ""DNA sequence alignments"": ""Many of the molecular evolutionary methods for detection of recombination events involve the analysis of multiple DNA sequence alignments. In choosing coronavirus sequences for our analyses, we made an effort to maximize both genetic diversity of the different coronavirus variants, as well as the length of possible contiguous comparative data (i.e. in excess of 20 kb). We aligned (ClustalW; Thompson et al., 1994) a large portion of the SARS virus TOR2 strain, at the DNA sequence level, between positions 7349-20969, to other coronaviruses from previously designated groups I, II, and III Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . At the time of manuscript submission, there were 36 complete, or nearly complete, genomes of SARS virus available, all of which were highly similar at the DNA sequence level, thus strain selection does not affect the results of our analyses. The DNA sequence alignments within this region had a few segments which could not be reliably aligned, and thus were excluded from our analyses. This resulted in 13 separate DNA alignments, which ranged in length from 245 to 3785 bp. Within each of these sub-alignments, any further ambiguous regions were deleted before recombination detection analyses. This was performed in a highly conservative manner, such that not only did we remove any and all remotely ambiguous gaps, but the regions surrounding the gaps were additionally excluded up to areas of clearly anchored sequence alignment (identical or virtually identical stretches of sequence) flanking either side of the gap (alignments available upon request)."", ""Recombination detection"": ""We used the recombination detection program PLATO (Grassly and Holmes, 1997) which employs a maximum likelihood (ML) approach to demarcate the boundaries of anomalous evolving regions in a DNA sequence alignment, with statistical measures of confidence. PLATO has a phylogenetic basis, and such methods have been shown to be somewhat less powerful than substitution distribution methods, in the sense that they are less able to identify more subtle examples of recombination (Posada et al., 2002; Posada and Crandall, 2001) . However, this in turn means that such approaches are also more conservative in their overall assessment, and indeed phylogenetic methods can only detect recombination events that change the topology (Posada et al., 2002; Posada and Crandall, 2001) . Importantly, the propensity for most recombination detection programs, including PLATO, to detect false positives appears to be low (Posada et al., 2002; Posada and Crandall, 2001) . PLATO was used to assess possible recombinant regions for each of the 13 alignments, employing parameters of an HKY model of sequence evolution, five steps for the sliding window, and 1000 replications of Monte Carlo simulation. To add a further level of conservative assessment to our recombination detection, phylogenetic analyses were performed on all partitions identified by PLATO, the putative non-recombinant portions of such alignments, as well as all the remaining alignments. For all of these phylogenetic analyses, the best fitting model of sequence evolution and the corresponding values for the rate matrix, shape of the gamma distribution, and proportion of invariant sites were estimated by the program MODELTEST (Posada and Crandall, 1998) . The evolutionary history of each region was compared to the control phylogeny, which was based on a concatenation of the 13 alignments. This control topology was the same as that derived from the concatenated non-recombinant sequence portions. A region was concluded as a SARS-CoV recombinant when all, or at least the majority (for shorter sequences), of phylogenetic methods agreed in their convincing placement of SARS-CoV in an alternative position to that of the control phylogeny. Phylogenies were reconstructed using Bayesian (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001) , maximum likelihood, neighbor joining (NJ, log det distances) and maximum parsimony methods, implemented in PAUP * 4.0b (Swofford, 2002) . For ML, starting trees were obtained via neighbor joining and for parsimony analyses addition sequence was employed with 10 random input orders. Tree-bisection reconnection (TBR) was the branch-swapping algorithm used in all analyses. Gaps were coded as missing data in all analyses. Bootstrap support values were obtained with 1000 replicates for maximum parsimony and neighbor joining analyses and 100 replicates for ML. Bayesian analyses were performed using Mr. Bayes (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001) with 500,000 generations, sampling frequency every 100 generations, four Markov chains, random starting trees, and a burn-in of 100,000 generations.The PLATO results were corroborated using split decomposition analysis (program SplitsTree; Huson, 1998) and bootscanning (Salminen et al., 1995) (program BOOTSCAN within the SimPlot package). Instances identified by PLATO as possible SARS-CoV recombinants were similarly identified by SplitsTree and bootscanning."", ""Results and discussion"": ""In the unrooted control phylogeny, SARS-CoV branches, with convincing support, along the lineage leading to group II coronaviruses (Fig. 1a) , which is in agreement with previous reports Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . The long branch separating SARS-TOR2 from the group II coronaviruses, in comparison to the branch lengths separating the various group II representatives, is in general agreement with earlier opinions for SARS-CoV as a new, fourth group of coronaviruses (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) , and contrary to Snijder et al. (2003) who suggest, based on analysis of replicase ORF1b, that SARS-CoV is more aptly considered a distant member of group II. For the individual alignments the models of sequence evolution identified by MODELTEST were GTR+gamma (alignments corresponding with TOR2 coordinates: 10, 645-10,902; 12,613-13,344; 13,725-14,147; 20,100-20,984; and recombinant regions: 15,259-15,342; 19,577-19,862) , 125; 13, 610) , GTR + gamma + invariants (7366-7710; 10,147-10,626; 11,554-11,973; 11,989-12,516; 18,117-18,980; 14,172-17,936; 19,065-19,871) , or HKY + gamma (recombinant region: 15,974-16,108).Under our recombination criteria, several regions of recombination were evident, involving two alternative positions of SARS-CoV (Fig. 1b and c) . These two branching arrangements were SARS-CoV on the branch leading to group III viruses (avian) or as sister lineage to the group I clade (porcine, human, etc.). PLATO identified anomalous regions included 15,259-15,342 (Z value of 5.0666; Z values greater than 3.8896 judged to be significant), 15,974-16,108 (Z value of 4.3997; Z values greater than 3.8896 judged to be significant), and 19,577-19,862 (Z value of 6.1619; Z values greater than 3.6471 judged to be significant). Phylogenetic analysis of 15,259-15,342 supported SARS-CoV with group III (Fig. 1b) , whereas 15,974-16,108 supported SARS-CoV with group I (Fig. 1c) . Phylogenetic analysis of the third putative recombinant region identified by PLATO (i.e. 19, 862; Fig. 1d) , proved inconclusive, with ML and Bayes supporting SARS-CoV with group I, and parsimony and NJ yielding the control topology (bootstrap support under 60%, and Bayesian posterior probability less than 0.50). Three further recombinant regions were identified by phylogenetic analysis, that did not yield significant PLATO results, simply because the entire (or very nearly) alignment appears to represent a recombinant zone (i.e. nothing for PLATO to identify as anomalous; Fig. 1d ). Mutational saturation at synonymous positions of codons can be ruled out as a possible explanation for the alternative branching arrangements of these five (possibly six) recombinant zones, because phylogenies for these same regions based on alignments that exclude third codon positions, as well as amino acid sequences, yielded identical topologies. The resulting genomic picture suggests a complex evolutionary history of recombination involving SARS-CoV (Fig. 1d) . The placement of SARS-CoV on the branches leading to groups I or III and not nested within these groups indicates that either the recombination events are ancient in nature or the donor species are not present in currently available sequence data. The inclusion of greater host species representation, which is presently possible for a few regions of the genome, such as a 922 bp region of polymerase (for which there are additional GenBank sequences from cat, dog-group I; turkey-group III; human OC43, porcine-group II) (Stephensen et al., 1999) , did not allow a more specific identification of the possible species involved, and implicated the same recombination event between positions 15,259-15,342 (Fig. 1d) . Two recent reports regarding the SARS genome suggest, based on analysis of amino acid sequences, that there is either no evidence for recombination or no evidence for recent recombination involving other coronaviruses (Marra et al., 2003) . Although the methodological details regarding recombination detection are scant in both these reports, we gather that in the one case they came to this conclusion by comparing branching arrangements between gene trees (Marra et al., 2003) , and in the other case by performing an amino acid similarity plot . In the first case, a comparison of gene trees would not pick up recombination events that crossed gene boundaries, or which involved relatively short stretches of sequence within a gene. In the second instance, similarity plots will only tend to pick up recombination events in comparisons that involved the actual donor, a close relative to the donor, and/or a recent event.In contrast, our analysis agrees with Rest and Mindell (2003) in identifying recombination in RDRP (RNA dependent RNA polymerase), although our approach tends to suggest more specific break-points, and a larger number of smaller recombinant regions than does their analysis (three regions in RDRP: 13, 610; 15, 342; 15, 108 , based on TOR2 coordinates). We also identified several additional recombinant regions in the SARS-CoV genome, encompassing regions not analyzed by Rest and Mindell, including: 12, 344 including all of nsp9 and most of nsp10 and 18,117-18,980 of nsp14.Analyses of currently available sequences of coronaviruses, yields the conclusion that group III is exclusively composed of avian coronaviruses, while groups I and II have viruses isolated from pig, human, murine rodents, cat, dog and bovine. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV recombined with a member of the group III lineage, suggesting that an avian coronavirus was involved, a further point of general agreement between our results and that of Rest and Mindell (2003) . Other recombination events evident from our analysis, involve the branch leading to group I, which encompasses viruses from several mammalian taxa, including two very divergent strains of porcine coronaviruses. Thus, our analyses indicate that human SARS-CoV have a past history of recombination with coronaviruses hosted in distinct animal groups. Mixed animal husbandry practices, in proximity to human populations, could have led to the evolution of the SARS coronavirus and facilitated its progression as an infectious disease in humans. Novel human influenza viruses are thought to have arisen from the reassortment, within porcine hosts, of avian, swine, and human influenza viruses (Gregory et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 1999) . We suggest that our recombination results for SARS-CoV implicate a suspiciously analogous history. More specifically, SARS-CoV could have arisen from a combination of host jumping and recombinational events, involving as yet unidentified strains of avian coronavirus group III and mammalian (possibly pig) coronavirus group I. Rest and Mindell (2003) suggested host-species shifts have been relatively common in the diversification of coronavirus lineages, a result consistent with our hypothesis for SARS-CoV. Critical to determination of the evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV are expanded epidemiological surveys of wild and domestic animals, including in particular, additional avian species.Understanding the origin and evolutionary history of SARS-CoV is important to proper vaccine development as well as the epidemiological modeling of future outbreaks. Current perception of the SARS-CoV genome is one of relative genetic stability (Brown and Tetro, 2003; Ruan et al., 2003) , however, our analyses indicate that SARS-CoV has a complex history of recombination, suggesting that the genome may not be as stable as previously thought. We propose that future epidemiological modeling efforts and vaccine development take this new evidence into account.""}",Evidence from the evolutionary analysis of nucleotide sequences for a recombinant history of SARS-CoV,"Abstract The origins and evolutionary history of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) remain an issue of uncertainty and debate. Based on evolutionary analyses of coronavirus DNA sequences, encompassing an approximately 13kb stretch of the SARS-TOR2 genome, we provide evidence that SARS-CoV has a recombinant history with lineages of types I and III coronavirus. We identified a minimum of five recombinant regions ranging from 83 to 863bp in length and including the polymerase, nsp9, nsp10, and nsp14. Our results are consistent with a hypothesis of viral host jumping events, concomitant with the reassortment of bird and mammalian coronaviruses, a scenario analogous to earlier outbreaks of influenzae.",10.1016/j.meegid.2003.10.001,Elsevier; Medline; PMC,PMC7128439,15019585.0,els-covid,2004-03-31,"Infection, Genetics and Evolution",,,,114086.0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134803001217; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134803001217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15019585/,2004.0,paper

Lassa virus (LASV), the causative agent of Lassa fever, is carried primarily by the multimammate rat, Mastomys natalensis, but other carrier rodents have been identified recently [2] [3] [4] . LASV infects up to an estimated 300,000 people each year in western Africa following exposure to rodent excreta or through hunting and consumption of infected rats [2, [5] [6] [7] [8] . Lassa virus can also spread person-to-person through direct contact with infected bodily fluids, and this pattern of transmission has occurred repeatedly in hospital workers caring for Lassa fever patients since its discovery in 1969 [9] [10] [11] . Overall, the case fatality rate is estimated at 1-2%, but significantly higher rates of fatality occur in hospitalized patients [5] . Since Z protein of the Old World arenavirus LCMV [40, [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . Accordingly, we hypothesized that the functionality of the LASV Z protein may be regulated by phosphorylation. To address this hypothesis, mass spectrometry was used to identify phosphorylated residues in LASV Z. This approach revealed three sites of phosphorylation, including two phosphorylated serines and one tyrosine. A VLP release assay demonstrated that serine phosphorylation may negatively impact virus release. These findings are an important first step toward understanding how various functions of the LASV Z protein can be regulated by post-translational modifications."", ""Results and Discussion"": ""To identify sites of phosphorylation, LASV Z protein was affinity purified from VLPs produced from plasmid-transfected cells and subjected to protein gel electrophoresis ( Figure 1A ). The gel band corresponding to LASV Z was excised and proteolytically digested. The resulting peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Three phosphorylated residues in the LASV Z protein were identified: two serine residues (S18 and S98) and one tyrosine residue (Y97) ( Figure 1B , Figures S1 and S2). Representative mass spectra and the accompanying fragment ion tables for peptides harboring phosphorylated Y97 ( Figure S1A ), phosphorylated S98 ( Figure S1C ), as well as corresponding unphosphorylated peptides are shown ( Figure S1B ). Representative mass spectra and corresponding fragment ion tables of the peptides harboring phosphorylated S18 ( Figure S2A ) and unphosphorylated S18 ( Figure S2B ) are shown.Each phosphorylation site was mapped onto the NMR structure of LASV Z ( Figure 1B ) [52] . The arenavirus Z protein is comprised of a central zinc-binding, really interesting new gene (RING) domain flanked by N-and C-terminal domains that appear to be flexible and relatively unstructured [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] . All three phosphorylation sites identified are located in these flexible N-terminal (S18) or C-terminal (Y97 and S98) domains of the Z protein ( Figure 1B ,C) [52] . The N-terminal domain of Z is known to mediate several important functions. It contains a myristoylation site at the second glycine residue which is required for virus budding as well as Z's interaction with the plasma membrane and with the envelope glycoprotein [30, 34, 35] . Other conserved residues in the N-terminal domain contribute to the production of infectious virus-like particles [58] . Additionally, the N-terminal domain of pathogenic arenaviruses, including LASV, but not of non-pathogenic arenaviruses, can directly bind to and inhibit the function of retinoic acid-inducible gene 1-like receptors (RLRs), which results in decreased macrophage activation [25, 59] . The Clustal Omega multiple sequence alignment tool was used to align select mammarenavirus Z proteins ( Figure 1C ) [60] . This revealed that the S18 phosphorylation site is conserved across LASV strains representing lineages III-VI, as well as in Mobala virus and the New World Oliveros virus ( Figure 1C ) [61] [62] [63] . Notably, a histidine residue is found at this position in multiple lineage II LASV isolates that have recently been sequenced [64] . Interestingly, aspartic acid and glutamic acid, which are negatively charged at a physiological pH similar to phosphate, are substituted for S18 in a number of other New and Old World arenavirus Z proteins, suggesting that a negative charge at this position may be important for Z functionality ( Figure 1C ). Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gel of affinity-purified LASV Z. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were used to affinity purify Z from virus-like particles (VLPs) released from cells cotransfected with plasmids encoding a biotin ligase and LASV Z C-terminally tagged with a biotin acceptor peptide (BAP). The band corresponding to the LASV Z protein (indicated by the red box) was excised from the gel and subjected to proteolytic digestion with trypsin or a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin. The resultant peptides were extracted and subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis.

(B) The protein nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the Josiah strain of the LASV Z matrix (PDB 2M1S) is shown. The side chains of the phosphorylated residues (S18, Y97, and S98) are highlighted in green on the protein structure. The two late domains found in LASV Z, PTAP and PPPY, are colored orange. Zinc ions, which are coordinated by the central really interesting new gene (RING) domain of Z, are shown as yellow spheres in the protein structure. The myristoylated glycine residue (at position 2) is also indicated. (C) Protein sequence alignment of select mammarenavirus Z proteins. The Clustal Omega multiple sequence alignment tool was used to align the sequences of selected mammarenavirus Z proteins. The portion of the C-terminal region of each Z protein (the amino acids to the right of the dashed vertical line) containing the late domains (designated as orange, underlined amino acids) was aligned with LASV Z strain Josiah, starting with the most C-terminal amino acid. The following accession numbers were used: GU481069.1 (Lassa mammarenavirus, strain Nig08-04), AAO59514. The Y97 and S98 phosphorylation sites lie within the C-terminal tail of the LASV Z protein, a region which contains two proline-rich late domains, PTAP and PPPY ( Figure 1B ,C). The C-terminal amino acids containing the late domains of selected mammarenavirus Z proteins were aligned ( Figure 1C ). This analysis showed that Y97 is conserved across the majority of Old World mammarenaviruses (except for Lujo virus) and aligns with Pichind\u00e9 and Bear Canyon New World mammarenaviruses ( Figure 1C ). Conservation of a serine or threonine at residues that align with LASV Z S98 is fairly common among Old World mammarenaviruses ( Figure 1C ). Notably, LCMV possesses a glutamic acid at this position which could substitute for the negative charge of a phosphorylated serine ( Figure 1C ). However, LASV Z S98 is directly followed by a proline residue. Interestingly, phosphorylated serine or threonine residues directly preceding a proline (pS/T-P) constitute a type of motif that can be recognized by class IV WW domains, including the peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase, NIMA-interacting 1 protein (Pin1) [65, 66] . Pin1 can mediate conformational changes in substrate proteins that result in altered protein stability or phosphorylation state [67] . Because Pin1 has been implicated in different viral infections and has been shown to bind pS/T-P motifs within viral proteins from hepatitis B virus [68] , human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 [69, 70] , human immunodeficiency virus 1 [71] [72] [73] , Epstein-Barr virus [74] , and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [75] , it may represent an interesting host target for further study in the context of the arenavirus Z protein.The Y97 phosphorylation site lies within the PPXY late domain, which is conserved across the majority of Old World arenavirus Z proteins ( Figure 1C ). Our lab recently showed that the homologous tyrosine residue (Y88) in LCMV Z is also phosphorylated [40] . Treating cells with H 2 O 2 to block tyrosine phosphatases and permit the accumulation of tyrosines phosphorylated by endogenous kinases demonstrated that both LCMV and LASV Z are phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue ( Figure 2A ) [76] . This strategy further showed that the phosphotyrosine levels of LASV Z were significantly reduced in the Y97F mutant of LASV Z, indicating that this late domain-embedded tyrosine is likely the major tyrosine phosphorylation site ( Figure 2B) , similar to what we observed for the PPXY-embedded Y88 in the case of LCMV [40] . A prominent function of the arenavirus Z protein is to drive the release of virus particles. We next sought to determine whether any of the three phosphorylation sites might contribute to the ability of Z to drive virus budding using a VLP release assay ( Figure 3A -C). For the phosphoserine residues at S18 or S98, LASV Z protein mutants encoding either an alanine or an aspartic acid substitution at these positions were made in order to prevent or to possibly mimic phosphorylation at the site in question, respectively. Phosphomimetic substitution did not result in a significant change in VLP release for either S18 or S98 ( Figure 3A ,C). However, substitution with alanine to either phosphoserine site resulted in levels of VLP release that were 1.5-or 2-fold greater than in the WT, suggesting that serine phosphorylation may negatively regulate the release of virus particles ( Figure 3A ). It is important to note that, in many cases, aspartic acid and glutamic acid do not functionally mimic phosphorylation, particularly when a phosphorylated residue is recognized by an adaptor protein [77] . Our results here could be explained if cellular kinases impinged on viral budding by promoting a phosphoserine-dependent protein-protein interaction, one which cannot be mimicked by the shape or charge afforded by aspartic acid.

Our results here could be explained if cellular kinases impinged on viral budding by promoting a phosphoserine-dependent protein-protein interaction, one which cannot be mimicked by the shape or charge afforded by aspartic acid.For the Y97 phosphosite, phenylalanine and glutamic acid mutants were generated, again to prevent or mimic phosphorylation, respectively. Release of VLPs from cells transfected with LASV Z containing either the non-phosphorylatable (F) or phosphomimetic (E) amino acid at residue 97 was decreased by roughly 50% compared to wild-type Z-containing cells ( Figure 3B,C) . Given that Y97 lies within the PPXY late domain, which has been previously shown to be required for efficient release of LCMV and LASV VLPs, the results were not surprising [23, 32, 40] and may indicate a cellular mechanism at play to regulate viral budding. Mutation of the canonical PPXY motif in LASV results in a loss of binding to Nedd4-family E3 ubiquitin ligases, which have been implicated in the release of several other viruses that have a PPXY domain in their matrix protein [24, 36] . However, in earlier work with LCMV, despite a reduction in VLP release, disruption of the PPXY late domain did not block the efficient release of infectious virus particles but rather that of defective interfering (DI) particles [40] . Furthermore, greater levels of DI particles were released with recombinant LCMV containing a glutamic acid substitution at its Y88 phosphorylation site relative to the Y88F-mutant virus, suggesting that phosphorylation may positively regulate the release of DI particles [40] . These data raise the intriguing question of whether a similar phenomenon (e.g., whereby phosphorylation of the PPXY late domain regulates the release of a specific class of viral particles) may be occurring with the LASV Z protein.There is currently little data confirming the presence of LASV DI particles. However, it is thought that most animal viruses produce some level of DI particles, and some arenaviruses in particular are known to produce significant levels of DI particles [78, 79] . More specifically, a high multiplicity of infection with LASV virus yields lower infectious titers and higher ratios of viral genomic RNA to particles compared with low-multiplicity infections [80] . These findings are consistent with a virus that produces appreciable levels of DI particles [81, 82] .A prominent function of the arenavirus Z protein is to drive the release of virus particles. We next sought to determine whether any of the three phosphorylation sites might contribute to the ability of Z to drive virus budding using a VLP release assay ( Figure 3A-C) . For the phosphoserine residues at S18 or S98, LASV Z protein mutants encoding either an alanine or an aspartic acid substitution at these positions were made in order to prevent or to possibly mimic phosphorylation at the site in question, respectively. Phosphomimetic substitution did not result in a significant change in VLP release for either S18 or S98 ( Figure 3A,C) . However, substitution with alanine to either phosphoserine site resulted in levels of VLP release that were 1.5-or 2-fold greater than in the WT, suggesting that serine phosphorylation may negatively regulate the release of virus particles ( Figure 3A ). It is important to note that, in many cases, aspartic acid and glutamic acid do not functionally mimic phosphorylation, particularly when a phosphorylated residue is recognized by an adaptor protein [77] . Our results here could be explained if cellular kinases impinged on viral budding by promoting a phosphoserine-dependent protein-protein interaction, one which cannot be mimicked by the shape or charge afforded by aspartic acid. The discovery of these phosphorylation sites opens up several new avenues for inquiry, including identifying the host kinases involved as well as any phosphosite-binding proteins that may regulate Z protein function. Kinase prediction algorithms could be used to narrow the possible candidate kinases, but empirical screens will be required to determine the kinase(s) that contribute most substantially to Z phosphorylation. Kinase identification for the LASV Z Y97 phosphosite may be aided by evidence in the literature implicating Src family or Abl tyrosine kinases in the phosphorylation of PPXY domains in other proteins-specifically, the Ebola virus matrix protein and the cellular proteins dystroglycan and IFITM3 [46, 83, 84] . It has also been shown for dystroglycan and IFITM3 that phosphorylation of PPXY motifs can regulate the binding of proteins that contain SH2 domains as well as of the Nedd4-family ubiquitin ligases that bind PPXY domains through their WW domain [83] [84] [85] . It is plausible that Old World mammarenavirus Z proteins are regulated in a similar fashion. It will also be important to identify phosphoserine-specific binding proteins (e.g., perhaps Pin1) or proteins containing other phosphoserine-binding domains in order to understand the mechanism by which serine phosphorylation regulates Z protein function [66] . Furthermore, it will be important to determine whether the S18 phosphorylation site or other residues in the N-terminal domain, that are more highly conserved among pathogenic arenaviruses, are involved in the inhibition of RLR signaling and macrophage activation [25, 59] . Finally, the clustering of two phosphorylation sites at the C-terminus of the LASV Z protein, spanning two distinct WW domain-binding motifs, contributes to the idea that this region of Z and its corresponding functions may be intricately regulated by a network of distinct host protein partners.

Plasmid LASV Z WT SBP is comprised of the LASV Z gene C-terminally fused to a six-amino acid linker (AAGGGG) followed by the streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP) affinity tag in a modified pCAGGS vector, as previously described [88] . Genes encoding point mutants of LASV Z (S18A, S18D, Y97F, Y97E, S98A, and S98D) were synthesized and subcloned into the LASV Z WT SBP vector by BioBasic, Inc. (Markham, ON, Canada) . Plasmids expressing the Armstrong 53b strain of LCMV Z (GenBank #AY847351.1) with a C-terminal SBP tag have been described previously [40] , as has the plasmid encoding the biotin ligase (BirA) [87] ."", ""Identification of Phosphorylation Sites by Mass Spectrometry"": ""To identify potential phosphorylation sites in LASV Z, 1 \u00d7 10 6 HEK293T cells/well were seeded into two six-well plates. After 24 h, each well was transfected with 100 \u00b5L DMEM containing 1 \u00b5g of LASV Z HA-BAP, 1 \u00b5g of plasmid BirA, and 10 \u00b5g of polyethyleneinimine (23966, Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA). After 48 h, the VLP-containing culture media was collected and clarified by centrifugation, then a solution of 1x Triton lysis buffer (0.5% NP40, 1% Triton X-100 (BP151-100, Fisher Scientific), 140 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris HCl) with protease (04693159001, Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (4906837001, Roche) was added to lyse the VLPs. Biotin-modified LASV Z protein was affinity purified by incubating the VLP lysate with Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 beads (65602, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at 4 \u2022 C while rotating. Following incubation, the beads were washed with 1x Triton lysis buffer and then were eluted in 4x Laemmli sample buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, 40% glycerol, 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 0.04% bromophenol blue) diluted to 1x in Triton lysis buffer with a final concentration of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol by heating at 100 \u2022 C for 10 min.

The region of the gel lane containing the Z protein was excised and either directly reduced and alkylated with iodoacetamide or not, prior to being subjected to in-gel digestion with a solution of sequencing-grade modified trypsin (V5111, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) or a mixture of trypsin and sequencing-grade chymotrypsin (V1061, Promega), as described previously [40, 51] . The resultant peptides were extracted from the gel slice using 2.5% formic acid in 50% acetonitrile and centrifugation. This supernatant was collected, and the gel slice was further dehydrated by incubating with 100% acetonitrile, centrifuging, and collecting the supernatant twice. The solvent was evaporated using a vacuum centrifuge at 37 \u2022 C, and the peptides were resuspended in 2.5% acetonitrile and 2.5% formic acid.

Data were acquired in both a stand-alone linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ-XL) and a linear ion trap-orbitrap (LTQ-Orbitrap) hybrid mass spectrometer (both instruments from Thermo Scientific). Ten MS/MS scans in the LTQ followed each linear ion trap or orbitrap survey scan over the entire run. A concatenated database of the LASV Z protein sequence including affinity tags in forward and reverse orientation was queried with SEQUEST software with no enzyme requirement and a 20 PPM precursor mass tolerance (or 2 Da for data collected in the stand-alone LTQ). The following differential modifications were allowed: +79.96633 Da for phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine; +15.99492 Da for methionine oxidation; and either 71.0371 Da for cysteine acrylamidation or +57.02146 for cysteine carbamidomethylation."", ""Detection of Phosphoproteins by Western Blotting"": ""In order to confirm the presence of phosphorylated LASV Z protein, 5 \u00d7 10 5 HEK293T cells per well were seeded in six-well plates and then transfected 24 h later with 2 \u00b5g of the corresponding Z protein plasmids using 8 \u00b5g of 1 mg/mL polyethyleneinimine. Two days after transfection, the cells were treated with 8.8 mM hydrogen peroxide, or water as a control, for 20 min (min) for phosphotyrosine detection. The cells were then lysed with 1x Triton lysis buffer containing both protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. SBP-tagged Z was affinity purified by incubating with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads for 2 h, followed by elution in 2x Laemmli sample buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 0.02% bromophenol blue) with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol by heating at 100 \u2022 C for 10 min.

In order to determine the percent VLP release, the value of each Z protein band on a particular blot was first divided by the sum of the values of all the Z protein bands on that particular blot (normalization by summation as described in [89] ). This normalized Z protein quantity in VLPs was divided by the normalized Z quantity in cells for each mutant, and these values were then normalized to the corresponding quotient of Z WT, as described previously [40] .

""}",Host-Driven Phosphorylation Appears to Regulate the Budding Activity of the Lassa Virus Matrix Protein,"Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV) is an enveloped RNA virus that can cause Lassa fever, an acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome associated with significant morbidity and high rates of fatality in endemic regions of western Africa. The arenavirus matrix protein Z has several functions during the virus life cycle, including coordinating viral assembly, driving the release of new virus particles, regulating viral polymerase activity, and antagonizing the host antiviral response. There is limited knowledge regarding how the various functions of Z are regulated. To investigate possible means of regulation, mass spectrometry was used to identify potential sites of phosphorylation in the LASV Z protein. This analysis revealed that two serines (S18, S98) and one tyrosine (Y97) are phosphorylated in the flexible N- and C-terminal regions of the protein. Notably, two of these sites, Y97 and S98, are located in (Y97) or directly adjacent to (S98) the PPXY late domain, an important motif for virus release. Studies with non-phosphorylatable and phosphomimetic Z proteins revealed that these sites are important regulators of the release of LASV particles and that host-driven, reversible phosphorylation may play an important role in the regulation of LASV Z protein function.",10.3390/pathogens7040097,PMC,PMC6313517,30544850.0,cc-by,2018-12-09,Pathogens,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6313517/,2018.0,paper

With the implementation of social distancing interventions, direct human contact has become highly restricted, with most activities that typically occupy youths' livesschooling, extracurricular activities, and socialization with peerstransitioning to electronic-based platforms. It is anticipated that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated societal response will have wide-ranging impacts on youth development and mental health (Golberstein, Wen, & Miller, 2020) . Sleep is crucial for child and adolescent health and well-being (Gregory & Sadeh, 2016) , and while we do not yet know how sleep has been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, the potential for sleep problems to emerge or worsen during this period is high (Altena et al., 2020) . This may be particularly true for children and adolescents, for whom developmental changes impacting sleep are rapidly occurring (such as those transitioning into adolescence) and for those who are at heightened risk for the onset of sleep and mental health disturbances. Youth with preexisting psychopathologies (including anxiety and depression) and neurodevelopmental conditions (including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and autism spectrum disorder [ASD]) may also be particularly vulnerable to disturbed sleep during this time of great change and uncertainty. It is thus imperative that sleep considerations be part of both clinical and research initiatives aimed at mitigating and understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in children and adolescents. This discussion is timely, not least because one of the many benefits of sufficient sleep of good quality is to support the immune system (Besedovsky, Lange, & Haack, 2019) . Here, we discuss ways in which sleep may be impacted by the pandemic and outline a research agenda for investigating this topic further.Possible negative consequences of COVID-19 for child and adolescent sleep While data are needed to help us understand the impact of COVID-19 on sleep, a wider literature indicates that the pandemic could have an impact upon sleep in children and adolescents.At the center of the pandemic is the virus itself. While symptoms appear to be relatively mild in the majority of children and adolescents, they can occur and include both respiratory difficulties and fever. Illness or hospitalization can have an impact on sleep (Besedovsky et al., 2019) . Isolation and shielding could result in increased sedentary behaviors and food consumption, which are likely to impact weight (Rundle, Park, Herbstman, Kinsey, & Wang, 2020) and consequently health and sleep over time. Children and adolescents may also experience increased levels of stress, given widespread changes in family financial situations, health concerns, and uncertainty about the future. These too can result in sleep difficulties (Tsai et al., 2018) .Further, social distancing advice to stay indoors can reduce exposure to sunlight, which is so central in establishing a consistent sleep routine. The latter may also be impacted by more flexibility in wake and sleep time and increased opportunity for prolonged daytime naps. Remote learning could increase time spent working in the bedroom or the bed, which contradicts widespread guidance to keep bedroom activity to a minimum so as to avoid associating the bed and bedroom with arousal. Remote learning and the absence of in-person social interactions also make it possible that youth spend more time using technology, including during the presleep period. Increased exposure to alerting 'blue light' can disrupt melatonin production, meaning that the body misses out on a biological cue that it is time to fall asleep (Dijk & Cajochen, 1997) . Bringing technology into the home could also expose some children, some perhaps for the first time, to cybervictimization and other online challenges. There is a clear need to assess and evaluate risk factors that may, independently or jointly, impair youths' sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic.Sleep and COVID-19: relevance for child and adolescent psychopathology Children and adolescents with preexisting mental health conditions may be particularly vulnerable to disturbed sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic or more prolonged sleep disturbances following the pandemic. Youth with anxiety or depression may be especially prone to COVID-related worries and rumination, which can interfere with sleep onset and quality. Youth with ASD may have particular difficulty with the extreme changes in routine resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing measures, and caregivers working from home as well as engaging in novel home learning. Youth with neurodevelopmental disorders, including ASD and ADHD, may be more likely to experience variable sleep/wake patterns due to possible altered circadian function, medication use, and co-occurring psychopathologies (Becker, Sidol, Van Dyk, Epstein, & Beebe, 2017) . It is important to understand which youth are most at risk for COVID-19-related sleep problems and psychopathologies, why certain subgroups may be more likely than others to experience negative consequences, what factors confer increased or decreased risk, how sleep and mental health unfold over time, and the optimal way to address sleep-related challenges in different populations.It is also possible that changes in sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbate or even contribute to psychopathology. Worsened sleep may increase negative affect, resulting in increased susceptibility to mood and anxiety problems. Shortened or poor sleep may lead to greater attentional difficulties and oppositionality for some youth, resulting in behaviors that mimic ADHD and commonly co-occurring symptoms. During and after the COVID-19 pandemic, it will be important to assess both sleep problems and psychopathology, which considered alongside a developmental and mental health history should allow for disentangling the emergence, exacerbation, and interrelations among these difficulties (Gregory & Sadeh, 2016) ."", ""Adolescent sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic: the perfect storm intensified?"": ""Adolescents may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19-related social isolation. They are required to physically distance from friends and, for some, romantic interests while simultaneously experiencing almost 24/7 proximity to caregivers. Adolescents increasingly prioritize peer relationships and autonomy, and the current situation may result in both loneliness and unique parent-teen challenges or negotiations (e.g., related to home learning or compliance with COVID-19 public health guidelines). The COVID-19 crisis likely also impacts activities that are key to adolescents' identity (e.g., part-time employment), physical activity (e.g., sports participation), and creativity (e.g., arts participation). The loss of these in-person activities and related peer relationships may contribute to less physical activity, increased negative affect, more lethargy or napping behaviors, and greater screen time and online social networking. These factors have the potential to directly or jointly impact bedtimes, sleep quality, and the regularity of sleep/wake patterns."", ""Potential for a good night's sleep?"": ""Although children and adolescents may experience worsened sleep during and as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, it is also possible that some youth experience improved sleep in certain domains. First, strong 'evening types' may benefit from greater flexibility afforded by home learning. Second and relatedly, there may be more opportunity for obtaining sufficient sleep since less time is spent traveling to and from school or engaging in social and extracurricular activities. These considerations may point to a silver lining for adolescents' sleep in particular: in-person schools are closed, meaning that many adolescents no longer experience early school start times and may thus be able to establish and maintain a schedule more aligned to their endogenous circadian rhythm, in turn also reducing social jetlag (given more consistency between weekday and weekend sleep) (Crowley, Wolfson, Tarokh, & Carskadon, 2018) .Third, youth who experience peer victimization or academic failure may find the break from in-person schooling and activities provides a respite from these stressors. This may, in turn, reduce rumination or distress around bedtime that can interfere with sleep onset and quality. However, this respite may only be temporary, and it will be important to monitor these youth as the novelty of social distancing wears off. Finally, youth may experience closer ties to family during times of crisis, as well as new or renewed shared activities (e.g., walks, puzzles/games, meals). These enhanced family bonds may promote feelings of connection and safety that also promote healthy sleep. These possible advantages for sleep need to be considered alongside the multitude of risks described abovemeaning that the overall impact of COVID-19 on sleep is far from clear. It is also possible that sleep may be improved in certain domains (e.g., sleep duration) and not others (e.g., sleep stability)."", ""Considerations for research and practice"": ""There are a number of important implications of youth sleep during and after the COVID-19 crisis for research and practice. Perhaps, most fundamentally, studies will be needed to examine whether, and if so how, the COVID-19 crisis and associated physical distancing impact child and adolescent sleep over time. For example, what domains of sleep are most clearly impacted, for better or for worse? Are changes in sleep temporary, or will a subset of youth experience longer-term sleep disturbances that originated during the COVID-19 pandemic? Will changes in sleep patterns (such as the possibility of increasingly late bedtime in adolescents) result in difficulties once normality starts to return (e.g., when schools reopen and early mornings are required once more)? Is sleep particularly impacted, in the short or long term, in children and adolescents experiencing certain risk factors, including mental health or neurodevelopmental conditions? It will also be important to evaluate COVID-19-related factors (e.g., personal loss, family financial strain, stress uncertainty) that may predict or maintain sleep disturbances in youth. Some home environments will have increased risks (e.g., increases in domestic violence, alcohol/drug use, child abuse/neglect) for both child sleep disturbances and psychopathology.Care will need to be made before extrapolating results to other situations, as the multiplicity of factors related to COVID-19 will mean that it is difficult to make direct comparisons to other situations (such as the impact of social isolation on sleep under different circumstances). Monitoring access to existing resources (prescription medication, services in and outside of the school context) will also be important as will establishing the best interventions for those who struggle with their sleep during and following COVID-19. Insomnia symptoms in children and adolescents can be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I; Dewald-Kaufmann, de Bruin, & Michael, 2019)and given the reduction in face-to-face contact, rigorous studies need to further establish the extent to which online delivery systems are effective in youth. Establishing healthy sleep practices is important, and statutory guidance to educate about the importance of sleep comes into UK schools from September 2020 (UK Department of Education, 2019). This guidance is quite timely, and its impact needs evaluation. It is noteworthy that medicines for insomnia in children are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency for insomnia in children (Bruni et al., 2018) . Studies should therefore also establish whether there has been an increase in prescription of medicine for insomnia in children and to monitor use over time.In conclusion, as this pandemic unfolds, there remains great uncertainty and risk to the health and well-being of children and adolescents. Supporting our youth to get a good night's sleep is just one way that we can help them cope with the uncertain days ahead.""}",Editorial Perspective: Perils and promise for child and adolescent sleep and associated psychopathology during the COVID‐19 pandemic,"It is anticipated that the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic and associated societal response will have wide‐ranging impacts on youth development and mental health. Sleep is crucial for child and adolescent health and well‐being, and the potential for sleep problems to emerge or worsen during and following the pandemic is high. This may be particularly true for children and adolescents who are at heightened risk for the onset of sleep and mental health disturbances and for those whom developmental changes impacting sleep are rapidly occurring.

Only way to respond against this critical condition is by practicing large-scale social distancing. India lock down for 21 days, however, till 7 April 2020, SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were growing exponentially, which raises the concerns if the number of reported and actual cases are similar. Methods: We use Lasso Regression with α=0.12 and Polynomial features of degree 2 to predict the growth factor. Also, we predicted Logistic curve using the Prophet Python. Further, using the growth rate to logistic, and carrying capacity is 20000 allowed us to calculate the maximum cases and new cases per day. Results: We found the predicted growth factor with a standard deviation of 0.3443 for the upcoming days. When the growth factor becomes 1.0, which is known as Inflection point, it will be safe to state that the rate is no longer exponential. The estimated time to reach the inflection point is between 15-20 April. At that time, the estimated number of total positive cases will be over 12500, if lockdown remains continue. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that there is an urgent need to take action to extend the period of lockdown and allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks.

We would like to clarify that the dry heating condition recommended in our paper is 65-70 o C but not 100 o C 3 . The selection of this condition is based on the facts that 1) coronavirus is effectively inactivated at 65 o C or above for 30 minutes 4 , and 2) dry heating at 70 o C or below has minimal effect on the deformation of meltblown polypropylene which comprises the mask filtration material 5 . Due to this limited temperature range, we recommend using a heating apparatus with a temperature adjusting feature such as an oven, incubator, or blanket warmer. A microwave oven is not recommended because there are metal parts in the face mask, the effects on the filter are unknown, and the temperature is not tunable.So far, there is no experimental data to compare the effect of dry heating vs UV irradiation on inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. A study by Kariwa et al showed that the infectivity of SARS-CoV was abolished by dry heating at 56 o C for 60 min whereas residual infectivity of SARS-CoV was still detected with UV irradiation of 134 \u00b5W/cm 2 for 60 min 4 . This suggests that SARS-CoV is relatively resistant to UV irradiation. Despite the survival of residual SARS-CoV, the UV irradiation achieved more than 5 log reduction of SARS-CoV (3.8 x 10 7 to 1.8 x 10 2 ). Therefore, UV irradiation still considered as an effective approach for decontamination of coronavirus.In sum, it is our hope that our article is not seen as a criticism of alternative methods that others are using to reduce exposures in PPE-limited environments; our goal was to pass on a reliable, simple, and cost-effective method that would be available to anyone in need.""}",Reply to Notes and Comments on “Proposed Approach 1 for Re-using Surgical Masks in COVID-19 Pandemic”,"We appreciate the thoughtful comments by Dr. Torres, et al which provides convincing evidence that UVC is capable of penetrating through face mask material to inactivate virus 1,2 .

If the number of days is the same in the two columns, then the growth is exponential, as it is predicted by conventional epidemiological models (SIR) for the beginning of epidemic when the number of uninfected (susceptible) individuals can be considered as approximately constant. In Italy, Iran, and France, the number of days in the second column is larger than in the first column. In Italy main restrictions were adopted beyond ten thousand initial infected. In Germany this difference is small at the moment, so it is early to make conclusions. In USA and Spain the number of days is the same and the growth rate is slightly larger in Spain.

According to some media reports, there is a shortage of testing facility and/or shortage of testing kits in many countries, and the accurate number of infected individuals can be much larger [7] . Dynamics of the number of infected individuals can be influenced by various factors, in particular, by their spatial distribution and nature of social mixing. Appearance of new focuses of infection can essentially change the growth curves. For example, at the whole world level, development of the epidemic in Europe started when it was mostly at decaying mode in Asia. Instead of the standard growth-decay curves, this leads to growth-decaygrowth curves. Some elements of this more complex dynamics where the number of newly reported daily cases decreased during several days was also observed in some countries.If we suppose that the distribution of infected individuals is uniform over space, then the SIR model predicts the exponential growth at the beginning of epidemic. Some time later, the growth rate decreases due to the decrease in the number of susceptible individuals, and the number of infected individuals decays at the end of epidemic. There are recent works with various modifications of the epidemiological models trying to take into account some specific features of the coronavirus pandemic [6, 9, 16] .Analysis of the data on seasonal influenza shows that dynamics of epidemic spread can include the period of accelerated growth ( Figure 1 ). In the beginning of epidemic, the growth rate is exponential. At the next stage it continues to grow exponentially but with an increased growth rate. It can be considered as two different exponential functions where the second one has a larger exponent than the previous one. A possible explanation of this effect is related to the presence of sub-populations with different response on the infection. Simplifying the situation, we can consider two sub-populations, one of them with a weak immune response and another one with a strong immune response. The strength of immune response is determined by the rate of production of antigen specific immune cells. We will define it below. At the beginning of epidemic, infection propagates among the first subpopulation. When the epidemic reaches certain level, the second sub-population becomes also involved increasing the number of susceptible individuals.Transition between the two stages of epidemic growth can be related to the number of infected individuals. If it is small enough, then a healthy individual rarely meets infected individuals, and the initial viral load remain small. People with a strong immune system can eliminate infection without developing disease symptoms, while people with a weak immune system can fall sick. At the later stages of epidemic, when the number of infected individuals is sufficiently large, an uninfected individual can cross several infected individuals during a short period of time. Therefore, the initial viral load becomes larger, and people with a strong immune response can also become ill.In order to describe this two stage epidemic growth, we develop in this work an immunoepidemiological model combining the individual level and the population level. This model is generic but it can take into account specific features of a particular infection or the details of epidemiological situation (like quarantine, social distancing, self-isolation, etc.). In the next section, we will discuss some epidemiological data on influenza epidemic. Section 3 is devoted to a model of immune response where we show how people with weak and strong immune system can react on a given initial viral load. Immuno-epidemiological model is studied in Section 4."", ""Two stage epidemic"": ""There are large amount of data available for the seasonal influenza epidemic. A typical graph of the number of cases is shown in Figure 1 (left, blue curve) [5] . Growth rate of the number of positive cases between weeks 1 and 6 is exponential. The red curve shows the approximation of the blue curve with the function 20.5 exp(0.2x), where x is the number of weeks. The same curves are shown in Figure 1 (right) in the logarithmic scale. The red curve here is a straight line. The weeks 7-10 show different growth rate with some acceleration in growth. It also corresponds to an exponential growth but with a different exponent. Some other data are presented in Appendix 1. Figure 1 : Data on seasonal influenza in Europe in 2019-2020 [5] . The left graph shows the number of influenza-positive specimens from non-sentinel sources (blue line) and its approximation by an exponential (red line). The right graph shows the same curves in the logarithmic scale.Conventional epidemiological models like SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, see, e.g., [11] ) and their numerous variants describe the density of infected individuals I by the typical equationwhere S and I are the densities of susceptible and infected individuals, and \u03bb is a positive constant. The first term in the right-hand side of this equation characterizes the appear-ance of new infected individuals due to their contact with susceptible. The second term corresponds to the decrease of I due to the recovery or death of infected individuals.In the beginning of the infection spreading, the number of infected and recovered individuals are much less than the number of susceptible, so that we can approximate S by a constant S \u2248 S 0 . Using this approximation, we obtain a linear differential equation with constant coefficients. Its solution is given by the function I(t) = I 0 exp(\u03b1t), where I 0 is the number of infected individuals at the initial moment of time, and \u03b1 = \u03bbS 0 \u2212\u03bd. If \u03b1 > 0, then I(t) exponentially growth. The same condition can be written as R 0 > 1, where R 0 = \u03bbS 0 /\u03bd is the basic reproduction number.Thus, according to equation (2.1), growth of the number of infected individuals is exponential in the beginning of epidemic, and it slows down later when S decreases. Exponential growth in the beginning corresponds to the data in Figure 1 . However, it does not describe accelerated growth during the second stage of epidemic. A possible explanation of this acceleration is that in the beginning the epidemic, disease spreads mainly among the people with weak immune response. At the second stage, people with strong immune response become also exposed. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we consider a model of immune response in the next section."", ""Model of immune response"": ""We consider a qualitative model of immune response suggested in [2] :where v and c are the concentrations of viruses and immune cells within the organism. The first term in the right-hand side of equation ( The maximal level of viral concentration is determined by the initial viral load v 0 , the virulence of infection w, and the strength of immune response s. For a given virulence of infection w > 1, the maximal viral load increases with for larger initial viral loads and decreases for stronger immune response. If we set W = w ln w\u2212w+1, then v * = v 0 exp(W/s).Suppose that there are two levels of immune response s 1 and s 2 , with s 1 < s 2 . The first one corresponds to weak immune response and s 2 to strong immune response. For a given initial viral load v 0 , the corresponding maximal virus concentrations are v * 1 and v * 2 , where v * 1 > v * 2 . Disease development depends on virus concentration in a threshold way. If its level exceeds some critical value, which is determined by a proportion of infected tissue, then disease symptoms are developed, and the person is considered as infected and fall sick. If this critical level of virus concentration v c is such that v * 1 > v c > v * 2 , then people with weak immune response become ill while people with strong immune response remain healthy. The same property is preserved in the full model, where s 1 < s 2 leads to v * 1 > v * 2 for the same v 0 (see Appendix 2) .However, if the initial virus load increases with the progression of epidemic, then v * 2 also increases and it can overpass the critical level. We consider this question in the next section."", ""Immuno-epidemiological model"": ""We can now bring together the epidemiological model and the immune response model making a link between the number of infected individuals I, the initial viral load v 0 , and the number of susceptible individuals S. We suppose that the v 0 = v 0 (I) and S \u2248 S(v 0 ) = S(v 0 (I)). Hence, the number of susceptible becomes a function of the number of infected. As before, let us assume that the total population consists of two sub-populations, one of them with weak immune response and another one with strong immune response. If the initial viral load v 0 is less than some critical valuev 0 , then the maximal viral concentration in the case of strong immune response remains less than the critical level v c which determines the appearance of the disease. This critical viral level can be determined from the equality v c =v 0 exp(W/s 2 ). Hencewhere S 1 corresponds to the sub-population with weak immune response and S 2 to the total population. Under this assumption, the explicit dependence v 0 (I) is not needed. We suppose that the viral load is an increasing function such that v 0 (I) <v 0 for I < I c , and v 0 (I) \u2265v 0 for I \u2265 I c . Then instead of equation (4.1) we can write:We can now find the solution:HereHence, the number of infected individuals grows with exponent \u03b1 1 till some critical time t c , and with a larger exponent \u03b1 2 for t > t c .Quarantine model. Another epidemiological model was introduced in [16] , in order to take into account removal of infected individuals to quarantine when the incubation period is finished and they manifest disease symptoms:Here I(t) is the density of latently infected individuals (during the incubation period), \u03c4 is the length of the incubation period. In this case we have three time intervals: 0 < t < t c where t c is such that I(t c ) = I c ; t c < t < t c + \u03c4 , and t > t c + \u03c4 . We assume S(t) = S 1 , S(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) = S 1 for 0 < t < t c , and the solution of equation (4.3) is as follows:where I 0 is the initial number of latently infected individuals, and \u00b5 1 satisfies the equation. This equation has a positive solution if the basic reproduction number R 1 = \u03bbS 1 \u03c4 is greater than 1. Let us recall that R 1 characterizes the number of newly infected individuals during the incubation period. The value t c can be found from the equality I(t c ) = I c , t c = 1 \u00b5 1 ln Ic I 0 . During the second time interval t c < t < t c + \u03c4 , we have S(t) = S 2 and S(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) = S 1 . The solution of equation (4.3) writes:where \u00b5 2 satisfies the equality \u00b5 2 = \u03bbS 2 (1 \u2212 \u03b8e \u2212\u00b5 2 \u03c4 ), \u03b8 = S 1 /S 2 . Since \u03b8 < 1, this equation has a positive solution and hence \u00b5 2 > 0.If t > t c + \u03c4 , then S(t) = S 2 , S(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) = S 2 ,where I 1 = I c e \u00b5 2 \u03c4 , and \u00b5 3 satisfies the equation \u00b5 3 = kS 2 (1 \u2212 e \u2212\u00b5 3 \u03c4 ). This equation has a positive solution if the basic reproduction number R 2 = \u03bbS 2 \u03c4 is larger than 1. Let us note that \u00b5 1 < \u00b5 3 < \u00b5 2 . Therefore, the final growth rate is larger than the initial one but less than the intermediate."", ""Discussion"": ""Numerous data on seasonal influenza epidemic shows that growth of the number of infected individuals can occur in two stages. Both of them are characterized by an exponential growth rate but the second exponent is larger than the first one. Growth accelerates when the number of infected reaches certain threshold. It should be noted that usually several virus strains are observed during influenza epidemic. All of them show similar growth pattern.Such dynamics can not be captured by conventional epidemiological models like SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered). These models predict exponential growth at the beginning of epidemic when the number of susceptible S can be considered as approximately constant or too large compared to initial number of infected. During the disease progression, S decreases, as a consequence the growth rate of disease progression also decreases. The number of infected passes through a maximum and then decays to 0.The goal of this work is to develop a minimal mathematical model which can describe accelerated growth of disease spread. Our main hypothesis is that this acceleration can occur if we take into account the presence of different sub-populations, namely, with weak and strong immune response. In the beginning of epidemic, only (or mainly) people with weak immune response are concerned while at the second stage people with strong immune response also become susceptible. This transition takes place when the number of infected individuals becomes significantly large, and an uninfected individual has enhanced probability of interactions with infected individuals. This increases the viral load received during a short period of time and leads to the disease propagation in the sub-population with strong immune response.In order to analyze how the initial viral load influences the disease initiation and progression, we consider an immuno-epidemiological model describing the concentration of viruses and immune cells in the organism. The strength of immune response in the model is determined by the rate of multiplication of immune cells. We show that for the same initial viral load, an individual with a weak immune system falls ill while an individual with a strong immune system does not develop disease symptoms. However, if the initial viral load increases, then the individuals with strong immune response also start developing the disease.The combination of immunological and epidemiological models allows the description of the interplay between the population level and individual level [3, 4, 10, 14, 15] . We use here this approach to study a possible acceleration of epidemic growth rate.We describe a generic situation applicable to different types of epidemics. During the influenza epidemic, the critical level of incidences when the growth accelerates is from 50 to 150 per week over 100 000 of the population (Figures 1, 3, 4) . Taking into account that the disease duration is about one week, then we get an estimate of the number of simultaneously infected individuals. The situation is different for the coronavirus infection because the disease duration is longer (about 4 weeks) and because the patients with manifested symptoms are put in quarantine. Therefore, we need to take into account here only the latently infected individuals during the incubation period. For a country with the total population 10 million and duration of the incubation period is one week, the critical level of epidemic is about 1400 new daily cases. This estimate does not take into account the restrictions on the population movement (it does not affect the influenza epidemic).The immuno-epidemiological model developed in this work is not pathogen specific. We suppose that it can be also applied to coronavirus infection since the strength of adaptive immune response plays important role in the disease progression [8] . It should be noted that in some cases excessive immune response can damage lung tissue and provoke important clinical consequences.Limitations of the model. The main hypothesis of this work is that epidemic progression begins with a sub-population characterized by weak immune response and, at a later stage, it continues in the whole population. Though this assumption seems plausible, we do not have direct confirmation that this heterogeneity of the population plays a significant role during epidemic spread.A particular choice of the epidemiological model is not essential here since all of them give exponential growth for the number of infected individuals. The exponential growth rate is proportional to the density of susceptible individuals. Once we suppose that effective density of susceptible can increase during epidemic because different sub-populations are involved one after another, we can obtain the increase of the growth rate.The immunological model used in this study is very simplified. It does not take into account for the involvement of many different cell types, intracellular regulation, time delay in virus production and clonal expansion of immune cells, and some other relevant aspects. However, it captures the main features of the interaction of viral infection with the immune response. Its simplicity allows to couple it with the epidemiological model.Let us note that system (3.1), (3.2) can also be explicitly solved if the functions p(v) and h(v) are linear (and the second assumption is satisfied). The strength of immune response is characterized by the parameter p 1 which determines the rate of clonal expansion of immune cells in response to the antigen. A lesser value of p 1 Figure 3 : Data on seasonal influenza in UK [12] . The left graph shows the number of influenza-positive specimens from non-sentinel sources (blue line) and its approximation by an exponential (red line). The right graph shows the same curves in the logarithmic scale. Figure 4 : Data on seasonal influenza in Belgium [13] . The left graph shows the number of influenza-positive specimens from non-sentinel sources (blue line) and its approximation by an exponential (red line). The right graph shows the same curves in the logarithmic scale. corresponds to weaker immune response ( Figure 5 ), a larger value of p 1 to stronger immune response ( Figure 6 ). There are 7 trajectories in each figure starting from the same (pairwise) initial condition for some small values v = v 0 (initial viral load) and c = c 0 (initial concentration of antigen specific cells). If the initial viral load is sufficiently small, then in both cases the trajectories converge to the virus-free stationary point corresponding to the curing. However, in the case of strong immune response the maximal and the total virus concentrations are less. Therefore, strong immune response can prevent the development of the disease while weak immune response may not be sufficient for this. If the initial viral load is sufficiently large, then weak immune response can lead to a chronic infection or to death while strong immune response leads to virus eradication.""}",Immuno-epidemiological model of two-stage epidemic growth,Epidemiological data on seasonal influenza show that the growth rate of the number of infected individuals can increase passing from one exponential growth rate to another one with a larger exponent. Such behavior is not described by conventional epidemiological models. In this work an immuno-epidemiological model is proposed in order to describe this two-stage growth. It takes into account that the growth in the number of infected individuals increases the initial viral load and provides a passage from the first stage of epidemic where only people with weak immune response are infected to the second stage where people with strong immune response are also infected. This scenario may be viewed as an increase of the effective number of susceptible increasing the effective growth rate of infected.,,ArXiv,,,arxiv,2020-03-31,,,,2003.14152,214728196.0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14152v1.pdf,2020.0,paper

The C. sativa L. plant originates from Central Asia and has recently seen an increase in interest likely because of its many applications due to the large phytochemical content as well as being a rich source of both cellulosic and woody fibers [1] . Two preparations of marijuana for recreational use are hashish (resinous) and marijuana (leaves and flowers) [2] . Synthetic cannabinoids are emerging as psychoactive substances and have recreational use [3] . Recreational use of marijuana, hashish synthetic cannabinoids are associated with ischemic and other types of strokes [2] . The cannabinoids, which are oxygen containing aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, are one of the most researched groups of all the phytochemicals in C. sativa L. and include at least 70 compounds, of which delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are some of the most well-known [4] . THC and synthetic cannabinoids have affinity for the cannabinoid receptors. CBD does not have affinity for the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) and the cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) and there is animal model evidence to show it modulates the adverse effects of ischemic stroke and likely acts on the sigma-1 receptor [5] [6] [7] . Additionally, CBD, in laboratory animal models, has been shown to be a beneficial treatment in substance use disorder including protection of the liver from alcohol damage [8, 9] . The US government recently passed the Agriculture Improvement Act which included changes to the production and marketing of hemp and derivatives of cannabis with extremely low concentrations of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). These changes removed hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, but preserved the US Food and Drug Administrations' (FDA) authority to regulate cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds. This study is investigating the toxicology of a proprietary CBD rich hemp extract.With the increasing interest in using products containing CBD in humans, it is essential to fully evaluate the safety of CBD consumption. While the published oral toxicological studies on CBD and hemp extracts are limited, the current available data suggests CBD is safe for human consumption, though additional studies need to be conducted. A review by Bergamaschi et al. [10] described in vivo and in vitro reports of CBD administrations at a variety of dose levels. The authors concluded that several studies support the conclusion that CBD is well tolerated and safe for humans at high doses and with chronic use, but there is evidence of potential drug metabolism interactions (pharmacokinetics), cytotoxicity, and decreased receptor activity (pharmacodynamics). Therefore, the authors also stated additional studies are needed to further evaluate the safety of CBD. A more recent review was conducted by Iffland and Grotenhermen [11] to build on the Bergamaschi et al. [10] review regarding CBD safety and any potential side effects. This review also concluded that numerous studies show that CBD is well tolerated and safe in humans at high doses and with chronic use. However, in order to further understand CBD and validate these findings, additional studies evaluating the safety of CBD are needed. The objective of the current studies was to assess the genotoxicity and preclinical safety of a proprietary hemp extract and to contribute significant safety data on CBD to the currently limited available data."", ""GLP, OECD, and National Research Council compliances"": ""Three Ames tests, one on the extract diluted in olive oil and two on undiluted extracts, and two oral (gavage) dosing studies in rats were completed.

(2425 55 th Street, Suite 100, Boulder, CO 80301) and is a proprietary blend of 9% hemp extract and 91% organic extra virgin olive oil, which is produced by an isopropanol extraction method under current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP). Fatty acids comprise approximately 88.70% of this extract, while the phytocannabinoid content is 6.96% (of this, 6.27% is CBD); the remaining 4.34% consists of fatty alkanes, sterols, terpenes and tocopherols. Therefore, approximately 100% of the constituents of this proprietary hemp extract are accounted for. An Ames test was conducted on this test article and two additional Ames tests were conducted on undiluted extract, one an isopropanol extract and the other a supercritical CO 2 extract. This was done to determine the impact, if any, of the olive oil on the results. Additionally, this product meets the Federal requirements for hemp products under the Agriculture Improvement Act in regard to THC. The test article used in these studies met the specifications outlined in Table 1 and the cannabinoid content is listed in Table 2 .

Criteria used for selecting animals for both studies were adequate body weight gain, absence of clinical signs of disease or injury, and a body weight within \u00b1 20% of the mean within a sex. For the 14-day study, 40 rats were distributed to treatment groups according to stratification by body weight so that there was no statistically significant difference among group body weight means within a sex (Table 3) . Sixty male rats weighing 224-286 g and 60 female rats weighing 170-218 g were distributed to treatment groups stratified by body weight among the dose and control groups (Table 4 ). For both the 14-day and the 90-day studies, body weights were recorded twice during the acclimation period and weekly for the duration of the study.

The physical exam included observing for changes in skin, fur, eyes, and mucous membranes, occurrence of secretions and excretions and autonomic activity (e.g., lacrimation, piloerection, pupil size and unusual respiratory pattern). The exam also included changes in gait, posture, and response to handling, as well as the presence of clonic or tonic movements, stereotypies (e.g., excessive grooming, repetitive circling), or bizarre behavior (e.g., self-mutilation, walking backwards). All abnormal observations were recorded. Rats in the 90-day study (during week 12) received a Functional Observation Battery in an open field for excitability, autonomic function, gait and sensorimotor coordination (open field and manipulative evaluations), reactivity and sensitivity (elicited behavior) and other abnormal clinical signs including, but not limited to convulsions, tremors, unusual or bizarre behavior, emaciation, dehydration and general appearance.

Whole blood samples were kept cold until examined in the laboratory using standard hematology methods. For clinical chemistry, blood was allowed to coagulate, and the samples were centrifuged in a refrigerated centrifuge. The serum supernatant was harvested and placed in cryotubes, and frozen and stored at -80\u00b0C until thawed and assayed. Hematology parameters were determined on an ADVIA 120 Hematology System (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and clinical chemistry parameters were determined on a COBAS C311 autoanalyzer (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Blood samples used to determine the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were collected immediately before terminal sacrifice by venipuncture of the inferior vena cava during anesthesia with isoflurane.

For all in-life endpoints that were identified as multiple measurements of continuous data over time (e.g. body weight, body weight gain, food consumption, and food efficiency), treatment and control groups were compared using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), testing the effects of both time and treatment, with methods accounting for repeated measures in one independent variable [17] . Significant interactions observed between treatment and time, as well as main effects, were further analyzed by a post hoc multiple comparisons test; e.g. Dunnett's test [18, 19] of the individual treated groups to control. When warranted by sufficient group sizes, all endpoints with single measurements of continuous data within groups (e.g., organ weight and relative organ weight) were evaluated for homogeneity of variances [20] and normality [21] . Where homogeneous variances and normal distribution was observed, treated and control groups were compared using a one-way ANOVA. When one-way ANOVA was significant, a comparison of the treated groups to control was performed with a multiple comparisons test, e.g., Dunnett's test [18, 19] . Where variance was considered significantly different, groups were compared using a nonparametric method, e.g., Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric analysis of variance [22] . When non-parametric analysis of variance was significant, a comparison of treated groups to control was performed, e.g., Dunn's test [23] . Significance was a probability value of p < 0.05.For hematology and clinical chemistry, the data from male and female rats were analyzed separately. Means and standard deviations were calculated for all quantitative clinical pathology parameters using Pristima\u00ae version 7 (Statistical Analysis, Xybion Corporation, Lawrenceville, NJ). These data were analyzed in a sequential manner. First, Bartlett's test for homogeneity and Shapiro-Wilk test for normality was done. If the Bartlett's test for homogeneity and Shapiro-Wilk test for normality were not significant, a one-way analysis of variance followed with Dunnett's test was performed. If the Bartlett's test for homogeneity and Shapiro-Wilk test for normality were significant then data transformations to achieve normality and variance homogeneity were done. The order of transformations attempted was log, square root, and rank-order. If the log and square root transformations fail, the rank-order was used. When an individual observation was recorded as being less than a certain value, e.g., below the lower limit of quantitation, calculations were performed on one-half of the recorded value. For example, if bilirubin was reported as < 0.1 or \u22640.1, then 0.05 was used for all calculations performed with that bilirubin data. When an individual observation was recorded as being greater than a certain value, e.g., above the upper limit of quantitation, then a greater value was used in place of the recorded value. For example, if specific gravity was reported as > 1.100 or \u22651.100, then 1.100 was used for all calculation performed using that specific gravity value.

The studies were conducted in the presence and absence of a metabolic activation system from male Sprague-Dawley rats which had been induced with phenobarbital and benzoflavone (Moltox Inc, USA). The overlay agar and minimal glucose agar plates were purchased (Moltox Inc, USA). The fresh bacterial suspension cultures in the nutrient broth were prepared so that they were in the late exponential phase of growth when used. The test article in olive oil was formulated as a solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to provide the required dose levels of up to 76,335 \u03bcg/plate to account for the 6.55% of active ingredient (6.27% CBD). For the undiluted extract prepared by isopropanol or supercritical CO 2 extraction, the extract was formulated as a solution in DMSO to provide the required dose levels up to 5000 \u03bcg/plate. Positive controls were used, both in the presence and absence of a metabolic activation system.

In the 14-day study, centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy (increased cell size) in Groups 3 (3/10) and 4 (5/ 10) was seen that correlated with an increase in liver weights. Adrenal cortical vacuolation was observed and was mild in all Group 4 animals, minimal to mild in 3/5 of the Group 3 males and 4/5 of the Group 3 females and minimal in 1/5 for the Group 2 males. For the 90-day study, test article related histopathology changes were limited to hepatocellular hypertrophy of centrilobular hepatocytes. This lesion was seen in the male and female animals in Groups 2 to 4. The hepatocellular hypertrophy was associated with dose-dependent increases in absolute liver weight for Group 2 to 4 females, liver-to-body weight ratios for Group 3 females, and liver-to-body/brain weight ratios for Group 4 females. Significant (p < 0.05) increase in liver-to-body weight ratios for Group 3 females and liver-to-body/brain weight ratios for Group 4 females were seen. The increases in liver weight and ratios correlated with the microscopic finding of hepatocellular hypertrophy at all dose levels. Non-significant (p > 0.05) dose-dependent increase in absolute liver weight was observed for Group 2-4 females. The centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy and increased liver weights were not seen in recovery groups at the end of the 28-day recovery period indicating the hepatocellular hypertrophy was reversible.Vacuolization of the zona fasciculata at the same incidence and severity was observed in the adrenal glands of treatment and control (Groups 1 and 4) male rats and correlated with an increase in the weights of the adrenal glands.

The current studies were performed to better understand the toxicological profile of a CBD rich proprietary hemp extract and to assess the results in tandem with information currently available regarding the toxicity and safety of CBD. Marx et al. [4] reports on a battery of GLP compliant toxicological studies which were conducted on a supercritical CO 2 extract of the aerial parts of the C. sativa plant. Assay of the extract was 61% edible fatty acids, 26% phytocannabinoids (approximately 96% is CBD, < 1% THC) and 13% other plant chemicals including fatty alkanes, plant sterols, triterpenes, and tocopherols. In the 14-day repeated oral doserange finding study reported by Marx et al. [4] , a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) could not be determined, however, the results of a 90-day repeated dose study with a 28-day recovery period in Wistar rats was also reported. In this study, doses of 0 (sunflower oil vehicle), 100, 360 and 720 mg extract/kg bw per day were used. Significant decreases in body weight, body weight gain, and differences in various organ weights, compared to controls, were reported at the mid and high dose levels, but the authors concluded that many of the findings were reversible as they were trending towards normal at the end of the recovery period. A NOAEL for the hemp extract in Wistar rats in the 90day study was determined to be 100 mg/ kg bw per day and 360 mg/kg bw per day for males and females, respectively.In the 90-day study being reported here, test article related significant changes in body weights, daily body weight gain and feed efficiency were seen in the males in all treatment groups which was still noted at the end of the recovery period. The magnitude of the significant change in body weights, daily body weight gain and feed efficiency in the low and mid dose groups was less than 10% and showed signs of obvious recovery and were therefore considered to be not toxicologically relevant. The effect in the males receiving 800 mg/kg/ day was > 10% and was still evident at the end of the recovery period and was considered toxicologically relevant.Reported rodent studies have differing findings on hepatotoxicity when CBD is orally administered in high doses [4, 26] . Hepatocellular hypertrophy with a centrilobular pattern was observed in rat livers in the study being reported. This pattern of hepatocellular hyperplasia is frequently observed in rats and other animals exposed to agents that induce the CYP family of enzymes and can be associated with activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) [27] . THC has affinity for PPAR\u03b1, and CBD has very low to no affinity for PPAR\u03b1 and high affinity for PPAR\u03b3 [28] . Interaction with the PPAR\u03b3 is one of the mechanisms of action for CBD. In our study, we did not show the mechanism of action for the hepatocellular hypertrophy. We did show that the activities of liver enzymes in serum were not significantly changed by treatment with the test article and the hepatocellular hypertrophy was reversed during the 28-day recovery period. In the study reported by Marx et al. [4] , no histopathological changes were observed in the livers from the treated and control rats and the liver weights in the male and female rats in the 360 and 720 mg/kg body weight/day were significantly increased (p < 0.05) at 90 days. The 28-day recovery males and females receiving 720 mg/kg/day retained the significantly increased in hepatic weights. The induction of hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes (HDMEs) can be associated with increased liver weights, and hepatocellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia (increased number of cells) and elevation of hepatic-source enzymes in serum. The evidence in the scientific literature supports a conclusion that the centrilobular pattern of hepatocellular hypertrophy and increased liver weights observed in our study was due to induction of HDMEs and/or peroxisomes. No hepatocellular necrosis and changes in the clinical chemistries occurred which is evidence that liver damage did not occur. This conclusion is further supported by not observing hepatocellular hypertrophy and increased liver weights in the 28-day recovery groups that received the test article. Studies in laboratory animals have shown CBD to protect the liver from toxic insults [8, 29, 30] .In the study being reported both the treated and control male rats had the same incidence and severity of vacuolization of the adrenal zona fasciculata and the adrenal weights were significantly increased in the Group 4 females. The vacuolization of the adrenal zona fasciculata and increased adrenal weights were not observed in Groups 5 to 8. The histopathological lesions noted in the adrenal glands in the current study was seen in both control and high dose males and is not considered to be due to treatment with test article and not toxicologically relevant.The hemp extract in these studies was shown to be non-mutagenic in a bacterial test system used to evaluate mutagenicity. Marx et al. [4] reported on a GLP-compliant study that concentrations of 5,000 \u03bcg/ plate of a CO 2 supercritical extract of C. sativa were not mutagenic in a bacterial test system. Our GLP-compliant mutagenicity testing on the diluted extract showed that concentrations of 76,355 \u03bcg/plate were not mutagenic with and without the S9 metabolic activation. The extracts produced by isopropanol extraction and supercritical CO 2 extraction were not mutagenic with and without S9 metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 \u03bcg/plate. The bacterial test system with the S9 mix did cause mutagenicity providing evidence that mutagenic metabolites were not produced with any of the extracts. The two additional Ames tests conducted on the undiluted extracts produced by two different extraction methods, were conducted to determine if the method of production or the olive oil diluent impacted the results of the Ames assay. No mutagenicity was noted in any of the tests conducted. Other botanical extracts have been evaluated for mutagenicity. Mutagenic studies on extracts from the plant Euphorbia triaculeata showed that it is not mutagenic and provides protection from the mutagenic effects of cyclophosphamide [31] . A study on a novel taste modulating powder derived from Cordyceps sinensis showed this product was not mutagenic in the Ames test and these results were supported in the micronucleus assay [32] . In a study on the genotoxicity of CBD in Caco-2 cells, 10 \u03bcM of CBD did not significantly cause DNA damage after 24 hours of incubation, and CBD was also shown in the comet assay to protect Caco-2 cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage [33] . CBD at an oral dose of 1 mg/kg was shown to significantly (P < 0.05) reduce azoxymethane-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci, colonic polyps and tumors [33] .In summary, the test article, both undiluted and diluted in olive oil, was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay and the NOAEL in the 90-day study was concluded to be 800 mg/kg bw/day and 400 mg/kg bw/day for female and male Sprague Dawley rats, respectively. This assessment adds significant data to the currently available literature as to the safety and toxicology of CBD rich hemp extracts. Given the potential of CBD for a variety of human uses and the limited data currently available, these results support that hemp extracts are likely safe human consumption and additional studies should be conducted to validate this conclusion.""}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,paper

Another recent report indicated that social media, particularly Facebook, are positively correlated with divorce [8] . Survey studies, such as that conducted by Clayton et al. [9] , had shown that high levels of Facebook use, when mediated by Facebook-related conflict with romantic partners, significantly predict negative relationship outcomes [9] [10] [11] . Previous studies clearly indicated that social media makes it easy for users to reconnect with any past lover, which could lead to emotional cheating and this could then lead to a breakup or divorce [9] [10] [11] . The diverse psychological and behavioral effects of social media on users necessitate further and deeper analysis. Such an analysis will be of value not only to academic researchers, but also to sociology experts, psychologists, psychiatrists, and even to those in the field of telecommunications to adapt and tailor these social media to the psychological health and needs of the users. Bibliometric and scientometric studies on Facebook and other social media have been carried out to assess the research trends in these social media in general [12] [13] [14] [15] . Similarly, several bibliometric and scientometric studies have been accomplished to assess the research trends in psychology and behavior [16] [17] [18] . However, no search of the literature for bibliometric or scientometric analyses of psychology publications pertaining to social media was found. In response, this study was designed to address this gap by mapping the literature regarding the largest and most popular social media (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Snapchat, and Instagram) [4, 5] in the field of psychology. Specifically, this study will assess the growth in publications, citation analysis, international collaboration, author productivity, emerging topics and the mapping of frequent terms in publications pertaining to social media in the field of psychology."", ""Methods"": ""The database used in this bibliometric study, the Web of Science (WoS) database: Core Collection [20] , is one of the largest and comprehensive bibliographic databases covering multidisciplinary areas. It encompasses over 12,000 of the highest impact journals worldwide (i.e. those considered to be highly influential in their fields) that contain somewhat higher data quality in the scientific, technical, medical, and social sciences [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .To retrieve the research related to social media in the field of psychology, we applied the following steps to conduct this bibliometric study:Step 1: The topic search query phrase \""(Facebook OR Twitter OR LinkedIn OR Snapchat OR Instagram)\"" was applied to gather all the publications with those phrases in their titles, abstracts, or keywords. The documents published during the period from 2004 to 2015 were included in the study while the years 2016 and 2017 were excluded, as those years are still open for new issues.Step 2: We then limited our retrieved publications related to social media to all those indexed under research categories related to psychology in the WoS database, including \""Psychology\"", \""Psychology Clinical\"", \""Psychology Developmental\"", \""Psychology Multidisciplinary\"", \""Psychology Experimental\"", \""Psychology Social\"", and \""Psychology Applied\"". Step 4: All the collected data were analysed and plotted based on the following characteristics: publication year, the main journal in the field, the institutions, the country/territory, the document type and language, the h-index, the impact factor (IF), the collaboration, and the citations. The IF was used according to the 2015 Journal Citation Reports \u00ae published by Thomson Reuters, 2016 [24] .Step 5: We then analysed the records to identify the relationship between the countries, the institutions, and the terms through visualisations the main clusters in each one by using VOSviewer v.1.6.5 software.

SPSS statistical software (SPSS for Windows, version 16) was used for the statistical analyses. The Pearson correlation test was used to determine the correlation between the number of publication in the field of social media and the number of publication related to social media in psychology. P values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.The descriptive statistics were presented as frequencies and percentages."", ""Results and discussion"": ""The present study outlines the bibliometric indicators of the scientific research related to social media in psychology during the research timeframe from 2004 to 2015.We found a total of 10,843 publications related to social media published between 2004 and 2015. There were 959 scientific publications related to social media in psychology. Nine types of documents were found, and the most common was research articles (873 documents), which accounted for 91.03% of the total publications.The second most common document type was meeting abstracts (41 documents, 4.28% of the total). As expected, the majority of the publications were written in English (99.06%). Figure 1 shows the publication productivity related to social media and the publication productivity related to social media in psychology over time. The correlation analysis clearly shows a high correlation between the number of publication in the field of social media and the publication productivity related to social media in psychology (r = 0.995; p value < 0.001). This increase in publications related to social media in psychology seems to be related to (1) social networking sites, which became very popular in previous decade [25, 26] ; (2) increasing interest in this field in multiple health disciplines [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] ; (3) or general cause such as the increasingly prevalent use of the internet, which has allowed more rapid distribution of medical knowledge through scientific research [32] . Table 1 shows information about the 10 countries with the most published papers. The USA is responsible for the most papers (548 documents, 57.14% of the total), with the highest h-index values (h-index value = 48). The USA is followed by the UK (69, 6.69%), Canada (46, 4.80%), Germany (46, 4.80%), and Australia (44, 4.59%). The h-index for all retrieved publications was 59. The publications with the most international collaboration were those from the USA (n = 100). The UK and China ranked second and third, with 35 and 17 documents for each, respectively. The collaboration between countries based on co-authorship is shown in Fig. 2 . The USA is the most networked country, collaborating with 26 countries, followed by the UK (n = 22) and Germany (n = 15). The USA was the most prolific country in producing publications related to psychology in social media, contributing to more than of half of the publications related to this topic. This research output from the USA is possibly due to the large size of the population or economic forces [33, 34] . Furthermore, most of the social networking sites were established and founded in the USA. These findings are similar to those found in previous bibliometric studies in different fields, principally that the USA had the highest activity in scientific research output worldwide and in international collaboration networks, as well as the highest h-index [32, [35] [36] [37] . Regarding the international collaboration, this emphasizes the significance of global networking and its impact on research output [38] [39] [40] [41] . Table 2 lists the top 10 most productive journals with their IF. The major publication outlets for research related to social media in psychology include The scientific landscape of main research areas related to social media in psychology is presented in Fig. 3 , based on the retrieved publications terms co-occurrence network from the retrieved publications. The most important research areas related to social media in psychology were personality psychology, experimental psychology, psychological risk factors, and developmental psychology. Based on the map, the four main clusters (denoted by the green, blue, red, and yellow colours) were characterised by the most commonly used terms in the research related to social media in the psychology field. Green coloured cluster represented terms related to the developmental psychology topic, such as \""child\"", \""adolescent\"", or \""adult\""; blue coloured cluster represented terms related to personality psychology, such as \""extraversion\"", \""openness\"", or \""romantic\""; red coloured cluster represented terms related to experimental psychology, such as \""empirical\"", \""experiment\"", or \""mechanism\""; and yellow coloured cluster represented terms related to psychological risk factors, such as \""risk\"" or \""alcohol\"". Table 3 lists the 10 most cited among these papers. The 10 most cited articles were published in 4 journals [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . The most-cited article, by Pempek et al., which investigated how much, why, and how college students use social networking sites, was published in the Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology in 2009 and has been cited 426 times [46] . The most recent manuscript in the top 10, by Lin and Lu, which investigated the factors affecting user's joining social networking sites, was published in 2011 and has been cited 241 times [44] . Table 4 shows the top 10 institutions based on the number of publications related to social media in the psychology field. It is worth noting that the University of Wisconsin-Madison ranked first in terms of the total publications (n = 39). Ohio State University (n = 25) was second to the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the total number of publications, followed by Michigan State University (n = 23) and the University of Texas at Austin (n = 23). Figure 4 shows the collaboration between the most prolific institutions.This bibliometric study represents the first concise analysis of the global publications related to social media in psychology and shows the benefits of bibliometric analysis for evaluating research productivity in [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] . The first is that the study was centred only on the most used social network worldwide. The value of other social networking sites might also be evaluated in order to provide a more faithful representation of all the research activities in this field. In our study, we decided to include only commonly-known networking sites related to the field of social media; however, social media is a rapidly changing and growing field [57] . A second limitation is that our study was based on the WoS Core Collection database; thus, it is expected that publications published in non-WoS-cited journals may not have been included in the analysis. Thirdly, some publications regarding social media might have been published in non-psychology journals."", ""Conclusions"": ""Up to the authors' best knowledge, this is the first ever bibliometric study to report worldwide activity in social media-related research in psychology field. Our study provides some novel insights useful for policy makers, researchers, and funders interested in advancing an evidence-based social media and psychology research agenda. International research collaborations and research networks should be encouraged to help prioritize social media-related psychology research particularly in countries with research capacities. Our findings provide baseline data for scholars and policy makers to recognize the bibliometric indicators in the current study as measures of research performance in social media for future policies and funding decisions. Finally, our study showed that bibliometric analysis is a good methodological tool to map published literature in a particular subject and to pin point research gaps in that subject.""}",Global trends in research related to social media in psychology: mapping and bibliometric analysis,"BACKGROUND: Social media, defined as interactive Web applications, have been on the rise globally, particularly among adults. The objective of this study was to investigate the trend of the literature related to the most used social network worldwide (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Snapchat, and Instagram) in the field of psychology. Specifically, this study will assess the growth in publications, citation analysis, international collaboration, author productivity, emerging topics and the mapping of frequent terms in publications pertaining to social media in the field of psychology. METHODS: Publications related to social media in the field of psychology published between 2004 and 2014 were obtained from the Web of Science. The records extracted were analysed for bibliometric characteristics such as the growth in publications, citation analysis, international collaboration, emerging topics and the mapping of frequent terms in publications pertaining to social media in the field of psychology. VOSviewer v.1.6.5 was used to construct scientific maps. RESULTS: Overall, 959 publications were retrieved during the period between 2004 and 2015. The number of research publications in social media in the field of psychology showed a steady upward growth. Publications from the USA accounted for 57.14% of the total publications and the highest h-index (48).The most common document type was research articles (873; 91.03%). Over 99.06% of the publications were published in English. Computers in Human Behavior was the most prolific journal. The University of Wisconsin–Madison ranked first in terms of the total publications (n = 39). A visualisation analysis showed that personality psychology, experimental psychology, psychological risk factors, and developmental psychology were continual concerns of the research. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study reporting the global trends in the research related to social media in the psychology field. Based on the raw data from the Web of Science, publication characteristics such as quality and quantity were assessed using bibliometric techniques over 12 years. The USA and its institutions play a dominant role in this topic.

When harmful factors and the possibility of accidents cannot be eliminated or effectively reduced in the working environment, PPE becomes the main protective measure for primary prevention. 1, 2 The objectives of PPE are to protect against physical, chemical, and biological factors. PPE is important for ensuring safe production in a factory environment, responding to public health emergencies, and maintaining the safety and health of workers. The status and role of PPE has received increasing attention with the recent economic development, improvement in workers' awareness of safety protection, and continuous expansion of the market demand for PPE.Classification PPE comprises equipment that protects the mouth, nose, eyes, ears, bare skin, and vulnerable parts (such as the head) of staff in accordance with their specific working environment.When classified by the use objectives, PPE includes: individual protective equipment for military personnel, such as bullet-proof helmets, bullet-proof clothing, gas masks, and combat boots; protective equipment for police, such as explosion-proof clothing, anti-stab clothing, and anti-glare glasses; protective equipment for diverse types of workers, mainly industrial and agricultural production staff, medical staff, and scientific and technological workers. When classified by the protection objectives, PPE includes: physical protective equipment such as insulating gloves, hardhats, and earmuffs; chemical protective equipment such as gas masks, acid-proof clothing, and alkali-proof clothing; biological protective equipment such as medical masks, goggles, and medical protective clothing; public safety protective equipment for public places, such as escape masks and life jackets in civil aviation passenger planes; protective equipment used in personal life, such as anti-haze and anti-UV goggles. 3 When classified by the protected body parts, PPE includes respiratory protectors, eye shields, face shields, ear protectors, helmets, protective clothing, gloves, and shoe covers."", ""Characteristics of skin damage caused by PPE"": ""Although the PPE used in different industries is made from various materials, the skin problems caused by PPE used for the same part of the body are basically similar, as these problems are mainly caused by poor air permeability, friction, and pressure on the skin. This section describes the characteristics of skin damage caused by PPE in different parts of the body."", ""Facial skin damage"": ""PPE for the face mainly includes respiratory protective equipment, such as various types of masks and goggles. Such equipment needs to be tightly attached to the skin surface, which compresses the skin at the fixed site for many hours and may result in device-related pressure injuries. 4, 5 The factors contributing to device-related pressure injuries include poor local blood circulation, tissue ischemia and hypoxia, skin evaporation, and the accumulation on the inside of the mask of a large amount of water vapor exhaled from the mouth and nose, keeping the facial skin in a moist environment for a long period; this softens and impregnates the skin, and reduces the ability of the stratum corneum to resist external pressure and shear forces. Thus, the skin is prone to indentations. 6, 7 In addition, the friction between the PPE and the skin enhances the development of erythema, blisters, or ulcers, along with pain and even secondary infection (Fig. 1 )."", ""Ear skin damage"": ""Long-term wearing of earmuffs can cause poor local circulation because of the pressure on the auricular skin, contributing to skin pain and excessive congestion after earmuff removal. However, long-term wearing of earmuffs is generally unlikely to cause epidermal rupture, as most earmuffs are soft, and the skin is evenly compressed. Anti-noise and dustproof earplugs rarely cause pressure damage, but contain materials such as rubber that may cause contact allergies. 8 The skin behind the ear is susceptible to device-related pressure injuries due to repeated friction caused by the ear ropes of facemasks. 9"", ""Head skin damage"": ""Aside from pressure injuries, wearing a helmet may also lead to other skin disorders. The scalp is rich in hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands, and therefore secretes large amounts of oil and sweat. Due to the poor permeability of hair, hats, and helmets, the sweat and oil secreted by the scalp mix together and remain on the skin surface of the head, consequently blocking the pores and making it easier for folliculitis to develop when bacteria colonize. Aggravation of this inflammation may lead to skin lesions such as pustules, boils, seborrheic dermatitis, and secondary fungal infection. "", ""Hand and foot skin damage"": ""To completely isolate the wearer from harmful substances in the environment, gloves and protective boots are mostly made of waterproof materials with poor air permeability, such as rubber and plastic. If the skin of the hands and feet is left in an air-impermeable environment for long periods, the sweat evaporation is decreased, and the skin is prone to impregnation, eczema, and sweat herpes. Furthermore, the hot and humid environment is conducive to fungal reproduction and tinea of the feet and hands. In addition to wearing gloves, hand hygiene is also essential for chemical and biological protection. Repeated washing damages the skin barrier and is partially accountable for dryness, itching, and eczema of the hands and feet. Furthermore, repeated contact with irritants such as disinfectants and gloves can cause contact dermatitis with erythema, pimples, pimples, exudation, or erosion. One study found that 52% of medical staff with hand eczema wash their hands more than 10 times per day. 10 Long-term disinfectant use also influences the microbiota and changes the immune microenvironment on the skin surface, resulting in conditions such as eczema, fungal infection, bacterial infection, and allergic dermatitis. 11"", ""Skin damage in other areas"": ""The materials used to make explosion-proof clothing, stab-resistant clothing, and other protective clothing are relatively hard, which may cause device-related pressure injuries due to friction between the clothing edge and the skin. Industrial and medical protective clothing have requirements for tightness, which keeps the skin over the whole body in a humid environment and makes it prone to impregnation. People with large amounts of sebaceous gland secretions are likely to develop acne in areas rich in sebaceous glands, such as the chest and back, due to the pores being blocked by sweat and sebum. Irritation from the sweat and contact with protective clothing might also cause an allergic skin reaction. In particular, the vulval, medial thigh, and perianal areas are predilection sites for skin inflammation and secondary bacterial and fungal infections due to excretion irritation and repeated friction during walking."", ""Device-related pressure injuries"": ""The key to preventing device-related pressure injuries is to reduce local skin pressure and shorten the compression time. 12 To ensure the protective effect, soft plastic PPE has strong compliance with the skin, relatively uniform pressure distribution, and relatively little local pressure. In areas where pressure is concentrated and there is repeated rubbing (such as the upper edge of goggles, the upper edge of the bridge of the nose, and the ear-closing parts of facemasks), the application of a dressing can help prevent pressure injuries by redistributing and reducing the pressure and avoiding the friction caused by relative displacement.Many types of hydrogel dressings, hydrocolloid dressings, and foam dressings are used in clinical practice to prevent stress injuries. Hydrogel has a rich water content and three-dimensional network structure, and has many characteristics that are beneficial to wound healing. Hydrogel dressings have good biocompatibility and compliance, as the porous structure guarantees breathability and absorbs and releases moisture to ensure that the skin moisture content is appropriate. Hydrogel also has cooling and analgesic effects. The hydrocolloid dressing also has good compliance and can be fitted to the skin of irregularly shaped body parts with minimal effect on the tightness of PPE. 13 The application of hydrogel or hydrocolloid dressings to the skin that is under pressure reduces the maximum pressure caused by the device, avoids friction between the device and the skin, and largely prevents pressure injuries 14 ( Fig. 2A-D) . The position of the PPE must be adjusted to ensure the tightness (Fig. 2E ). In addition, hydrogel and hydrocolloid dressings have selfadhesive properties, are easy to apply, and do not damage the skin during dressing removal 15, 16 (Fig. 2F) . Foam dressing is a decompression dressing that is often used clinically to prevent pressure ulcers. Foam dressing is very protective against pressure and shear force, and has a good liquid absorption capacity. 17 However, the thickness and material characteristics of foam dressing means that its compliance is not as good as that of hydrogel and hydrocolloid dressings, and care must be taken not to affect the tightness of the PPE during use. In addition, continuous compression and prolonged exposure to a humid environment increase the risk of pressure-related injuries. Workers should remove PPE as soon as possible after leaving the working environment, as this is conducive to skin self-repair.For simple indentation with a complete epidermis, no special treatment is required, as the skin will recover without intervention. For small sterile blisters, the epidermis is kept intact, and the blister fluid will be absorbed without intervention. For blisters with a large area or high tension, a sterile syringe is used to suction out the fluid from the bottom of the blister, topical antibiotic ointment is applied, and epidermal loss should be avoided. If there is erosion and exudation, the wound is washed with physiological saline after disinfection. Antibiotic ointment is required for infection prevention. Moreover, a suitable dressing is selected in accordance with the exudate. If there is a lot of exudate, an alginate dressing or foam dressing with good absorptivity is used. The hydrocolloid dressing is suitable for a medium amount of exudate, while a hydrogel dressing or a film dressing is suitable for wounds with less exudate or dry wounds. If ulcers appear on the skin, a wet dressing is also required to promote wound convergence. Silver ion dressings that resist bacteria and reduce the secondary damage caused by frequent dressing replacements are appropriate for infected ulcers. In addition, epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor can be used to promote cell proliferation and accelerate wound healing. Debridement may be needed for deep and chronic ulcers. 20"", ""Daily skincare routine"": ""A healthy and complete skin barrier is important to resist skin damage caused by PPE. Adequate cleaning and moisturizing are the basis of skin barrier maintenance. An appropriate cleaning frequency removes dirt, bacteria, and some sweat and oil from the skin surface, which reduces the irritation caused by their long-term presence and reduces the risk of infection. Adequate moisturizing helps maintain the moisture content of the corneum, maintains the \""brick-wall\"" structure of the epidermis, and facilitates cell self-repair. 18 Basic moisturizing usually consists of two categories: the application of a water-soluble moisturizer (including glycerin and sodium hyaluronate) that supplements natural moisturizing factors to lock in moisture, 19 and the application of squalane, mineral oils, and various natural oils to replenish sebum, which forms an oil film on the skin surface to prevent water loss. People with rich sebum in a closed equipment environment should use water-soluble moisturizers to prevent excessive oil from blocking the pores and causing acne."", ""Allergic skin conditions"": ""The appearance of eczema is often related to the impaired permeability of PPE or skin barrier damage caused by excessive washing. Moisturizing is important to restore the skin barrier. Eczema lesions are topically treated with a glucocorticoid ointment or calcineurin inhibitor such as tacrolimus ointment or pimecrolimus cream. If the eczema area is large or there is marked pruritus, a secondgeneration antihistamine can be taken orally.Contact dermatitis is an allergic reaction to the components of PPE. Care should be taken to avoid reexposure to the allergen. Treatment comprises oral antihistamines and topical glucocorticoids. Wet compresses are often required for exudation, and topical antibiotic ointments are required for ulceration."", ""Infectious skin conditions"": ""Intact skin is most likely to develop fungal infections in hot and humid environments. The most common of these fungal infections is tinea of the feet and hands, which causes macerative erosion. Topical treatments include antifungal cream and a 3% boric acid solution. For onychomycosis or a large area of fungal infection, the systemic application of antifungal drugs, such as oral itraconazole, should be considered. The most commonly seen bacterial skin conditions caused by PPE are folliculitis and furuncles, mainly due to Staphylococcus aureus infection. Folliculitis is treated topically with an antibacterial agent, such as 2.5% iodine tincture or mupirocin ointment. In the early stage of furuncles, 2.5% iodine tincture and 10% fishstone fat ointment can be used externally, combined with topical antibiotic ointments such as mupirocin, fusidic acid cream, erythromycin ointment, and recurring polymyxin B ointment. Mature lesions should be excised and drained, and systemic antibiotics may be needed."", ""Acne"": ""The pathogenesis of acne involves four factors: increased secretion of sebaceous glands, abnormal keratinization of the sebaceous ducts of the hair follicles, Propionibacterium acnes infection, and secondary inflammation. Apart from wearing appropriate PPE and avoiding prolonged use, general treatments include: proper skin cleansing, a reasonable selection of skincare products (mainly watersoluble moisturizers and no hormones), a low-sugar diet, and avoidance of squeezing pimples with the hands. Topical choices include retinoids (to regulate keratinization of the epithelium), benzoyl peroxide (to kill P. acnes), and salicylic acid (to dissolve acne and reduce inflammation), as well as erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol tincture, and other antibiotic preparations. When these topical treatments do not achieve a good effect, a combination of red and blue light treatment should be applied. Those with moderate and severe acne need oral medicine under specialist guidance, such as minocycline, isotretinoin capsules. Traditional Chinese medicine or photodynamic therapy can also be used."", ""Summary"": ""This review summarizes the causes and characteristics of skin damage caused by the use of various types of PPE, and introduces the corresponding skin protection and treatment countermeasures. The aim of this review was to provide reference material for workers in harsh environments. Especially in the wake of the current outbreak of COVID-19, we hope that this review helps the frontline medical staff to better protect their skin health and their own safety in their work.""}",Prevention and Treatment of Skin Damage Caused by Personal Protective Equipment: Experience of the First-Line Clinicians Treating 2019-nCoV Infection,,10.1097/jd9.0000000000000085,PMC; WHO,PMC7147274,,no-cc,2020-03-13,International Journal of Dermatology and Venereology,,#10162,,215787825.0,https://doi.org/10.1097/jd9.0000000000000085,2020.0,paper

Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is also a diarrheic pathogen in foals [2] . Recently, several ECoV outbreaks in adult horses occurred in the United States [3] and Japan [4] [5] [6] . Fever, anorexia, lethargy, leukopenia and digestive disorders were observed, and these clinical signs were reproduced in an experimental challenge study [7] . Equine coronavirus was also detected in fecal samples of diarrheic foals in the United States [8, 9] , but there have been no reports of an ECoV outbreak in foals.Slovis et al. [10] reported that approximately 30 % of healthy and diarrheic thoroughbred foals in central Kentucky in the United States were infected with ECoV, using a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. These results indicate that ECoV is prevalent among thoroughbred foals in central Kentucky. In Japan, ECoV outbreaks had previously occurred only in the draft racehorse population. Draft racehorses include French Percheron, Breton and Belgian horses, with body weights around 1000 kg. Outbreaks of ECoV had not been reported in the Japanese thoroughbred horse population, and its epidemiology is poorly understood. It is also unclear whether ECoV is related to diarrhea in Japanese foals. Therefore, we investigated ECoV using molecular diagnostic methods on rectal swabs collected from thoroughbred foals in the Hidaka district Open Access *Correspondence: nemoto_manabu@equinst.go.jp 1 Epizootic Research Center, Equine Research Institute, Japan Racing Association, 1400-4 Shiba, Shimotsuke, Tochigi 329-0412, Japan Full list of author information is available at the end of the article of Hokkaido, which is the largest thoroughbred horse breeding region in Japan.Between 2012 and 2014, we collected 337 rectal swabs from 307 diarrheic foals aged 2 days to 5 months in the Hidaka district of Hokkaido by using BD BBL Cul-tureSwab EZ (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Fukushima, Japan). Rectal swabs of twenty-two and four diarrheic foals were collected twice and three times, respectively. Multiple samples were collected with 3-106 days intervals (average 28.5 days). We collected 121 samples from 63 farms in 2012, 121 samples from 63 farms in 2013 and 95 samples from 44 farms in 2014. Rectal swabs from diarrheic foals were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C in the veterinary clinic until transport. They were transported to the diagnostic laboratory at around \u221218 \u00b0C, and after arrival they were kept at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. Additionally, 120 rectal swabs were collected from 120 healthy foals on 30 farms in the same region in 2012 by using BD BBL CultureSwab Plus (Becton, Dickinson and Company). Healthy foals were between 1 and 80 days of age. Rectal swabs from healthy foals were stored and transported at 4 \u00b0C for several days. After arrival, they were kept at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. These samples were immersed in maintenance medium [11] or phosphate buffered saline. Viral RNA was extracted from samples with MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and real-time RT-PCR assays were selected because these molecular methods have high sensitivity for ECoV [12] . The RT-LAMP reaction was performed using a primer set described previously [12] and a Loopamp RNA Amplification Kit (Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Calcein, a fluorescent detection reagent (Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan), was added to the reaction mixture for visual detection. The mixtures were incubated at 60 \u00b0C for 40 min and then heated at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min to terminate the reaction.Real-time RT-PCR assay was conducted using a primer set described previously (ECoV-380f, ECoV-522r and ECoV-436p) [3] and TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thermal cycling was performed as [7] : 50 \u00b0C for 5 min and 95 \u00b0C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 3 s and 60 \u00b0C for 30 s.For sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the nucleocapsid (N) gene, RT-PCR was performed using the primer set ECoV-Nf (5\u2032-tcaggcatggacaccgcattgtt-3\u2032) and ECoV-Nr (5\u2032-ccaggtgccgacataaggttcat-3\u2032) [5] using Pri-meScript II High Fidelity One Step RT-PCR Kit (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan). RT-PCR products were directly sequenced commercially by Fasmac (Atsugi, Japan).Sequence analysis was performed using the BLAST and CLUSTALW programs, and Vector NTI Advance 11 software (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences was conducted with MEGA software Version 5.2 [13] . A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on nucleotide sequences using the neighbor-joining method. Statistical analysis of the tree was performed with the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) for multiple alignments. [9, 14] , Obi-hiro2004 [4] , Tokachi09 [5] and Obihiro12-1 [6] Phylogenetic analysis was performed for the nucleotide sequences of the N gene (Fig. 1) . Phylogenetic analysis showed that Hidaka-No.61/2012 and Hidaka-No.119/2012 are closely related to the Obihiro12-1 and Tokachi09 strains, respectively.In this study, all diarrheic samples were negative for ECoV. This indicates that ECoV is not a causative agent of diarrhea in thoroughbred foals in Hidaka district of Hokkaido. Using 120 rectal swabs collected from healthy foals, only three samples (2.5 %) were positive for ECoV. Rectal swabs from healthy foals preserved at worse condition than that of diarrheic foals as described above. However, ECoV was only detected in rectal swabs from healthy foals, and therefore it is unclear whether storage condition influenced the result in this study. Compared with central Kentucky, ECoV is not prevalent among thoroughbred foals in Hidaka district of Hokkaido, but some outbreaks have occurred in draft racehorses. One reason for the lack of ECoV positive samples in thoroughbred foals may be that they do not usually have contact with draft horses. These results suggest that the prevalence of ECoV varies greatly depending on region. To further show this, it is necessary to investigate ECoV in other countries as well.In sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the N gene, there is little difference between Hidaka-No.61/2012 and Obihiro12-1. Obihiro12-1 was isolated in the ECoV outbreak in March 2012 [6] , and therefore the Hidaka In conclusion, this study shows that ECoV is not prevalent and was not related to diarrhea in thoroughbred foals in the Hidaka district of Hokkaido between 2012 and 2014.

The symptoms of respiratory virus infections can vary from mild to severe. Viral clearance may be delayed and prolonged viral shedding may occur [8, 18] . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses are the most frequently found viruses [4, 21] . Over the past 5 years, new viruses such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV), new coronaviruses (NL63 and HKU1) and human bocavirus (HBoV) have been identified as causing respiratory disease in humans [2, 10, 24] . The clinical impact of these new virus infections in immunocompromised children is not clear.We report three children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) suffering from symptoms of acute infection and positive for a new parvovirus, HBoV.

Before hospitalization he had suffered for 3 days from fever (maximally 39.0\u00b0C) and cough. On admission, total white blood cell count (WBC) was 8.2\u00d710 9 /l (70% lymphocytes, 8% neutrophils and 19% blasts) and bone marrow aspiration revealed precursor-Bcell ALL. The serum C-reactive protein level was 104 mg/l. The treatment of leukemia was started on the second day of hospitalization. The patient had cough and rhinitis and otitis media, but no evidence of pneumonia on the chest radiograph. He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The blood culture remained negative. The PCR test for HBoV was positive in the nasal swab. The HBoV load was low, accounting for \u2264500 copies per nasal swab sample. The stool sample was negative for HBoV.

In May 2000, he had a febrile episode while his leukemia treatment was in the consolidation phase and he was in remission. In addition to fever (38.6\u00b0C), he suffered from vomiting and diarrhea. The fever lasted for 1 day, and he was discharged after 2 days of hospitalization. His family members also had febrile gastroenteritis. On admission, the WBC count was 3.9 (75% neutrophils, 15% lymphocytes, no blasts), and the serum C-reactive protein level was <1 mg/l. HBoV was detected from the nasal swab sample with a low number of copies of HBoV, \u2264500 copies per nasal swab sample. The tests for the other 12 respiratory viruses remained negative. No stool sample was available. (Table 1) . HBoV was detected from the nasal swab samples with varying numbers of copies of HboV. Fever was the only symptom of infection in three of five HboV-positive episodes. Concomitant other viruses were detected in only one episode: rhinovirus by PCR from the nasal swab sample and cytomegalovirus by antigen detection from the blood sample. In the other four episodes, the tests for the other 12 respiratory viruses remained negative. All five febrile episodes were treated with broadspectrum antibiotics with full recovery."", ""HBoV was first identified by Allander et al. in 2005 by"": ""large-scale molecular screening from the respiratory samples of children with lower respiratory tract disease [2] . Multiple studies worldwide have since confirmed the common presence of HBoV in children with both upper and lower respiratory disease [3, 6, 13-15, 25, 27] . HBoV may also be associated with diarrhea [3, 14, 15] . The occurrence of HBoV has been reported to be higher in children than in the adult population, varying from 5.6% to 19% in young children with respiratory disease [3, 13] . The association between HBoV and respiratory disease has been questioned because coinfections with other respiratory viruses occur in 33-83% of the HboV-positive cases and in most cases [1, 6] . Recently, we found HBoV in 19% of 259 children hospitalized due to acute expiratory wheezing. In 12 cases (5%) HBoV was the only virus detected and in 10 of these cases a high viral load suggested primary infection. HBoV DNA was identified also in the serum of these patients suggesting a systemic infection [1] . It is important that in four studies with totally 491 asymptomatic controls only 3 positive cases have been detected supporting the causative role of HBoV in symptomatic subjects [1, 6, 14, 17] . On the other hand, lifelong persistence and reactivation of other parvoviruses have been reported with and without symptomatic disease during immunosuppression [7, 20, 23] .We describe HBoV infection in children with cancer. Tests for 12 other respiratory viruses remained negative in six out of seven reported febrile episodes. These tests found other concomitant respiratory viruses in 30 of 49 cases positive for human bocavirus in our previous study [10] . The occurrence of HBoV in febrile children with leukemia in our study was 5%. Our patients had symptoms of febrile respiratory disease and febrile gastroenteritis. They all recovered from infection within days without any need for intensive care. The causative role of HBoV, however, for febrile infection in our immunosuppressed patients is not clear. Most episodes were associated with HboV at low copy numbers, which we have suggested to present asymptomatic shedding in immunocompetent children. Our third case is, to our knowledge, the first reported patient with repetitive detection of HBoV showing prolonged shedding or reactivation over a 5-month period, thus supporting the hypothesis that HBoV may persist for a long time after primary infection [1] . It is not certain that the same HBoV strain was detected all the time, because no sequence studies were carried out. The genetic variability of HBoV is on the other hand very low [5, 22] . One may speculate that the high viral load detected in two febrile episodes indicates that HBoV could be a causative agent of [12] . Previously, one adult cancer patient with severe atypical pneumonia associated with HBoV detection has been reported [19] . This patient had symptoms of fever and cough, and a computer tomography scan of the lungs showed bilateral reticulonodular infiltrations. HBoV was detected from BAL samples, while all bacterial and fungal tests as well as tests for other respiratory viruses remained negative. Her symptoms subsided within days, and no mechanical ventilation was needed. Recently, HBoV detection in other adult and pediatric immunocompromised patients with previous organ transplants or patients with HIV infection have been reported from large respiratory disease surveys [3, 19, 26] .Currently, a great number of respiratory viruses are to be searched for in febrile infections. In some cases, a virus infection may explain a poor response to antibiotic treatment, and specific antiviral therapy may be available. On the other hand, respiratory virus infections may also pave the way to invasive bacterial infections, leading to even more severe morbidity. Searching for respiratory viruses should be a part of clinical practice in febrile children with cancer. Whether detection of respiratory viruses in these patients reflects primary infection, reinfection, persistence or reactivation deserves further studies.""}",Human bocavirus in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"A new human parvovirus, human bocavirus, has recently been identified in respiratory secretions, feces and serum. It is associated with lower and most likely also upper respiratory tract infections. Most commonly reported symptoms are cough, rhinorrhea, expiratory wheezing and fever, and the virus is preferentially detected in young children. We report three children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who had acute febrile episodes with concomitant detection of human bocavirus in their respiratory secretions. One of them had five consecutive febrile episodes during 6 months, all associated with the presence of human bocavirus at varying viral loads, suggesting prolonged shedding or reactivation of the virus.",10.1007/s00431-007-0631-8,Medline; PMC,PMC7086950,18038236.0,no-cc,2007-11-24,Eur J Pediatr,,,,23823973.0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18038236/,2007.0,paper
acdd7d690e7c72816ccc9ed6d17a0be9ccf74fd5,Erik Hoel,"Tufts University, Medford, MA, USA",,"{""Introduction"": ""During the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020, many of those in isolation reported an increase in the vividness and frequency of their dreams (Weaver, 2020) , even leading #pandemicdreams to trend on Twitter. Yet dreaming is so little understood there can be only speculative answers to the why behind this widespread change in dream behavior. This is despite the fact that humans spend hours every night dreaming and that dream deprivation is highly damaging to animals (Albert et al., 1970) ; indeed, dreaming is homeostatically regulated in that there even appears to be a \""dream drive\"" (Dement, 1960) . Additionally, dreaming is conserved across many species (Siegel, 1999) , indicating an essential evolved purpose (Cirelli and Tononi, 2008 ). Yet finding a biological function for dreams themselves has evaded resolution. The \""null theory\"" that dreams and even sleep itself are adaptive only in that they prevent organisms from moving during periods which they are not adapted to, such as ensuring that diurnal animals are inactive during night, is still taken seriously (Siegel, 2011) . This is despite the fact that around 50-70% of the time subjects report having a dream upon a sudden waking during sleep, with more dreams being reported later on in the night (Foulkes, 1962; Stickgold et al., 2001b) . Reports from those who keep regular dream journals, or who spend time each morning recollecting dreams, indicates that preserving a memory of dreams increases significantly with practice (Robb, 2018) . All this hints that individuals may regularly underestimate how much time they actually spending dreaming during sleep.What is the purpose of strange state? The fact that sleep overall has some relationship to learning was known even by the roman orator Quintilian (Duff, 2014 ). Yet, as will be discussed in detail in section 2, contemporary neuroscientific theories which relate dreaming to memory storage, memory replay, or emotional processing, still view dreams themselves as epiphenomena. And no contemporary theory appropriately accounts for the phenomenology of dreams and their sparse, hallucinatory, and narrative contents.This lack of viable theories about why animals dream stands in contrast with how much is known about sleep physiology and its stages (Lee and Dan, 2012) . As origi-nally discovered by lesion studies and later supported by genetic knockout studies, the sleep state is brought about by a far-reaching set of subcortical neuromodulatory systems, with no one system being necessary, indicating redundancy in how the waking state is sustained (Jones, 2005) . In general this multifaceted arousal system is excitatory during wake in that it has the greatest firing, and becomes more quiescent to bring about sleep, although this is not true for all such systems, especially those that establish REM.A classic signature of sleep are slow waves, which are waves of activity that traverse the cortex, which can be identified when the dominate frequency of EEG is less than 1 Hz. In this state, the cortex become bistable, oscillating between periods of intense firing and periods often referred to as \""down states\"" wherein neurons are silent. In general it should be noted that there is a spectrum wherein sometimes a brain region is experiencing slow wave sleep and this is not synchronized with other regions (Nir et al., 2011) . This is despite the fact that sleep itself is traditionally broken down into NREM sleep and REM sleep, with REM sleep being more associated with dreaming than NREM sleep. Yet there is evidence that dreaming occurs regularly throughout the night, across different sleep stages (Oudiette et al., 2012) , although it is rarest in the \""deepest\"" stage of NREM, stage 3, wherein surface EEG reflects low-frequency cortical slow-waves. Recent neuroimaging and sudden-waking experiments have demonstrated that all sleep stages can have dreams, which are the result of localized wake-like firing (Siclari et al., 2017) . On average high-frequency EEG signals in posterior areas of the brain were most correlated with reports on waking. Despite the ubiquity of dreams, it is still the case that REM is most strongly associated with dreaming, over 80-90% of the time in some awakening studies, althought it should be noted again that sleep involves a spectrum wherein it is difficult to find any stage at any time of the night that does not contain any dreams at all (Cipolli et al., 2017) . While early on in the night dreams can present themselves as more \""thought-like\"" and simple, later on in the night, particularly during REM, dreams can become incredibly complex with a fully-developed narrative structure (Siclari and Tononi, 2016) .As far as is currently known, dreaming of this latter sort is a brain-wide state where the brain is experiencing a single narrative or event, which is supported by the activation of the default-mode network during dreaming (Domhoff, 2011) . Consider, for instance, the evidence from sudden-waking experiments that higher frequency activity in the frontal lobe predicted emotional affect within the subject's dream (Sikka et al., 2019) . Or consider the evidence that during lucid dreaming activity is similar to waking movements in the sensorimotor cortex (Dresler et al., 2011) .Despite the nuances and redundancies of the cortical systems in play, it still makes sense to view the change from dreamless sleep to dreaming as occurring via a brainwide neuromodulatory system that regulates level of consciousness, such as by the firing increase of acetylcholinecontaining neurons during REM. Neuromodulatory systems also create the conditions of muscle atonia during dreaming, without which dreams can be acted out by the body during sleep, a dangerous parasomnia called REM sleep behavior disorder (Schenck and Mahowald, 2002) .What is the overall evolved purpose or function of sleep? The evidence of distinct physiological states brought about by neuromodulation suggests answering this requires identifying multiple functions, particularly for dreamless sleep vs. dreaming. Therefore, we should expect dreams to play an important part in the evolved role of sleep. Across the tree of life sleep as a whole is highly conserved; most mammals spend somewhere between 4-20 hours sleeping (Joiner, 2016) . There is even evidence that C. elegans sleeps (Trojanowski and Raizen, 2016). In the past two decades there has been significant progress when it comes to understanding the evolved function of sleep as a whole, although this has not been true for dreams themselves.First, a novel discovery has led to a clear purpose for at least one aspect of sleep. This was the discovery of the brain's gymphatic system, showing that sleep involves the brain-wide flushing of metabolites with cerebral spinal fluid (Xie et al., 2013) . This led to the theory that sleep, especially during slow wave activity, had the goal of waste clearance and this is at least partly behind sleep's restorative aspect. Glymphatic activity in the form of this flushing is low in waking but high during both sleep and anesthesia. In sleep and also in anesthesia the greatest amount of flushing occurs during slow wave sleep when low-frequency delta power dominates the EEG (Hablitz et al., 2019) , indicating that it may be anti-correlated with dreaming, although this has not been explicitly established.Another important theory of the purpose of sleep is the Synaptic Homeostasis Hypothesis (SHY) (Tononi and Cirelli, 2003) . According to SHY, daily learning leads to net synaptic potentiation across the brain, which, if left unchecked, would lead to a saturation of synaptic weight and a cessation of learning (Tononi and Cirelli, 2006) . SHY hypothesizes that slow waves trigger a brain-wide down-scaling of synaptic weights, thus ensuring that the relative weights of synapses are kept proportional while removing the risk of saturation. SHY has served as a model neuroscientific theory in that it has generated a number of new empirical findings (Bushey et al., 2011) . At the same time, it has also triggered fecund debate and investigation (Frank, 2012) . Again, SHY is more associated with slow wave sleep than with the high-frequencies that indicating dreaming.The purpose of dreaming phase or aspect of sleep lacks hypotheses as explicit and clear as those for slow wave sleep. In order to offer forward a distinct theory of the purpose of dreams, this paper outlines the idea that the brains of animals are constantly in danger of overfitting, which is the lack of generalizability that occurs in a deep neural network when its learning is based too much on one particular data set, and that dreams help mitigate this ubiquitous issue. This is the Overfitted Brian Hypothesis (OBH). The goal of this paper is to formally fill-out the OBH by investigating the evidence that the brain fits to a data set composed of the statistically self-similar daily experiences of the organism, while nightly dreams improve the generality of an animal's representations, cognition, and perceptual systems, by generating data far outside the organism's daily \""training set\"" in a warped or corrupted way (Hoel, 2019) . As will be discussed, the OBH fits with known biological understanding and data, matches better with dream phenomenology than other theories, and additionally has roots in common practices in deep learning. It makes unique predictions that can be tested both via computational modeling and also in vivo."", ""Contemporary theories of dreams"": ""A hypothesis for the evolved purpose of sleep must outline a clear and distinct function from other aspects of sleep. It must also explain how dreams present themselves, that is, the phenomenology of dream experience. Specifically, it must explain why dream phenomenology is different than wake phenomenology. Consider three phenomenological properties unique to dreams. First, the sparseness of dreams in that they are generally less vivid than waking life and contain less sensory and conceptual information, i.e., less detail. Second, the hallucinatory quality of dreams in that they are generally unusual in some way, i.e., not the simple repetition of daily events or specific memories. This includes the fact that in dreams events and concepts often exist outside of normally strict categories (a person becomes another person, a house a spaceship, etc). Third, the narrative property of dreams, in that dreams in adult humans are generally sequences of events ordered such that they form a narrative, albeit a fabulist one. As we will see it is not in spite of these properties that dreams serve their evolved purpose, but because of them.This section explores existent theories of dreams, the supporting evidence (or lack thereof) and how they fail to integrate well with, or explain, dream phenomenology."", ""Dreams are for emotional regulation"": ""The idea that dreams are important for emotional health is a descendant of Freudian theories of psycholanalysis (Freud and Cronin, 2013) . While Freud's theories of dreams as expressions of taboo frustration are discredited, there is still a historical association between dreams as expressions of, or important for, emotional processing.The specific proposals for how dreams impact emotional regulation involve hypotheses like that dreams are somehow for fear extinction (Levin and Nielsen, 2009) . Such hypotheses reason that dreams might act somewhat like cognitive behavioral therapy treatment for phobias, wherein they provide a safe space for \""rehearsals\"" toward fearful things in order to make them less frightful (Scarpelli et al., 2019 ). Yet there is no evidence that the fears of nightmares are the kind of irrational fears faced by those with phobias, nor that fears toward nightmarish events in general should be attenuated, as fear is evolutionarily quite useful.Another kind of theory is that dreams act as a kind of \""emotional thermostat\"" in order to regulate emotions (Cartwright, 2005) . From dream journals there is some evidence that more emotional dreams predict better recovery from disorders like depression (Cartwright et al., 2006) , although sample size for this sort of research is prohibitively small throughout oneirology. From neuroimaging there is evidence that emotional processing centers like the amygdala show greater activity during REM even than during wake (Hobson et al., 1998) , although the role of the amygdala ranges widely from emotions to rewards to motivations (Janak and Tye, 2015). There is some evidence that changes in REM sleep indicate mood disorders (Kupfer, 1976) . However, this isn't unique to only REM sleep, as NREM sleep is also changed or reduced in mood disorders (Gillin et al., 1979) , and many cognitive disorders show sleep problems in general (Peterson and Benca, 2006) . Sleep deprivation does appear to lead to emotional issues such as a lack of emotional inhibition and also irritability (Gruber and Cassoff, 2014) . But such failures of appropriate function holds true across many cognitive processes following sleep deprivation, including executive function, which would affect emotional regulation (Killgore, 2010).Overall, the hypothesis that dreams are for resolving emotional conflicts specifically does not have overwhelming empirical evidence. It is also not supported by the phenomenology of dreams, which, at least in general, are not intensely emotional. Indeed, neutral dreams are common. Overall there appears to be a bias to dreams in that they are more likely to have negative affect (Merritt et al., 1994) , although this may simply be that dreams which have high emotional valence are memorable (and it is worth noting that in studying dream reports joy/elation was the next most common to anxiety/fear). Given the evidence it seems likely that whatever the evolved purpose of dreams is, its function can affect emotions, but there is no evidence that dreaming has evolved specifically for emotional regulation."", ""Dreams are for memory consolidation"": ""Perhaps the leading contemporary theory is that dreams somehow involve memory consolidation and storage, often via a proposed form of memory replay (Wamsley, 2014) . The dominant metaphor for this theory of consolidation is that of the computer: memories need to be \""stored\"" somewhere in the brain, like storing a computer file on a hard drive, and therefore there must be a storage process. This viewpoint is held by much of traditional cognitive neuroscience, wherein the goal of the brain is to \""store\"" memories as veridically as possible (Marcus, 2009 ). The theory of memory consolidation is that this storage process occurs during dreams, or alternatively that dreams, by accessing previously stored memories, strengthen them, or that somehow dreams are a byproduct of integrating new memories with older ones.There is a significant line of research that draws from this theory, including many neuroimaging studies, and a full review of the literature would be beyond the scope of this paper (Vorster and Born, 2015) . However, there is also debate. Specifically the consolidation hypothesis is both very broad and rarely meant to specify just dreams rather than sleep in general (Siegel, 2001) . For example, there is evidence that learning a new task leads to a greater activation during both REM (Maquet et al., 2005) and slow wave sleep (Peigneux et al., 2004) in the task-relevant cortical areas. This is true even when comparing a wake/sleep condition versus a control condition without sleep but over the same time, which has found that BOLD activity increased in associated brain regions with the task (Debas et al., 2010) . But these sorts of neuroimaging studies are not very specific, since increased activation in relevant areas does not actually mean storage, nor replay, nor integration with existing memories. Indeed, they could be interpreted just as easily for evidence of the OBH (see Section 3.1). A significant line of direct evidence for the consolidation theory comes in the form of \""replay\"" of memories during sleep, a specific hypothesis with a clear thesis and standards of evidence. Replay was originally discovered in the hippocampus of rats (Wilson and McNaughton, 1994; Skaggs and McNaughton, 1996) , although the original analysis was again for slow wave sleep, not dreaming specifically. Indeed, the same statistically-increase in correlated neurons that counts as \""replay\"" occurs during quiet wakefulness, indicating it has nothing specific to do with dreams (Kudrimoti et al., 1999) . In general, if two neurons potentiate at the same time and from the same cause, they are more likely to be correlated in the sense of increased firing in the future, regardless of whether they are replaying anything specific, a view supported by the finding that \""replay\"" events are much faster in terms of their firing (Euston et al., 2007) .There are a number of significant issues with the specific hypotheses that dreams are replaying memories (Wamsley, 2014) . First, there is a lacking strong theoretical argument as to why offline replay of episodic memories would assist memorization, rather than introducing errors, since ground truth is absent offline. Indeed, neuroscience has shown that re-accessing memories generally changes them, rather than enforces them (Duvarci and Nader, 2004) .Additionally, replay is unlikely to be the purpose of dreams, since, as previously discussed, based on the most detailed studies on dream reports after awakenings, dreams are normally unconnected with the day's events (Nielsen and Stenstrom, 2005) . Except in cases of PTSD, dreams don't repeat specific memories, and those that do are considered pathological; for instance, closely after Hurricane Andrew, the only hurricane-related dreams, even from a sample of the population from the hardest hit area, were from those already diagnosed with PTSD (David and Mellman, 1997) . Overall, it appears that less than 1-2% of dreams reports have anything to do with episodic memories (Stickgold et al., 2001a) . And this is only when similarity is taken loosely (e.g., involving the same people despite having totally different events occur, or a task but much more hallucinatory or unrealistic). Indeed, there is significant evidence that episodic memory and dreams are dissociated (Fosse et al., 2003) . While there is behavioral evidence that repetitive daily tasks, like having subjects play Tetris for significant periods of time, can lead to Tetris-inspired dreams, such inculcated images or sequences do not represent replay in that they are not veridical repeats of previous games, being more hallucinatory and sparse. Moreover, dreams triggered by such repetitive games appear even in patients completely lacking all memory, those with clinically diagnosed amnesia (Stickgold et al., 2000) . It can take several days for repetitive tasks to show up in dreams, a form of \""dream lag,\"" and almost always these tasks appear in partial forms that are, again, only loosely similar (Blagrove et al., 2011) . Overall, the behavioral evidence suggests that dreams are not replays of memories or waking events.Additionally, well-controlled neuroimaging experiments show little evidence for exact sequence replication and strong evidence for mostly never-before-seen firing patterns (Gupta et al., 2010) . Therefore, there is a line of evidence from Tetris-studies to sudden wake-ups to dream-lag effects showing that partial or loosely-similar dreams can be triggered most reliably by recently-learned tasks, and yet such inculcated dreams generally take the form of never-before-seen experiences or sequences with the traditional dream-like properties of sparseness and hallucination, matching no specific memory but rather a seeming exploration of the state-space of the task itself.It is worth noting that in most cases the sparse, hallucinatory, and narrative properties of dreams are unaccounted for by the consolidation hypothesis. Most dreams do not involve specific memories at all, making the integration of new memories a questionable purpose for dreaming. Indeed, it is openly admitted that the consolidation hypothesis still views dreams themselves as epiphenomena (Wamsley, 2014). As we will see, much of the supporting results for the integration, replay, or storage of memories actually fits better with the OBH (Section 3.1)."", ""Dreams are for selective forgetting"": ""Notably, Francis Crick and his co-author proposed an alternative purpose for dreams in 1983, which they called \""reverse learning\"" Mitchison, 1983, 1995) . In this hypothesis the point of dreaming is somehow to remove \""undesirable\"" connections and help the brain \""unlearn.\"" Yet this hypothesis has been largely ignored in contemporary dreaming research. Instead, the alternative hypothesis, that dreams involve replay or consolidation of memory, became favored by the community (Vertes, 2004) due to the excitement around early replay results (Wilson and McNaughton, 1994) . Contemporary neuroscientific research often views there as being both a consolidation phase as well as a forgetting phase for memories, although this is again predominately associated with slow wave sleep, rather than dreaming specifically (Feld and Born, 2017) .Recently there has been computational work in spiking neural networks showing that in a specific model \""reverse learning\"" can indeed prove helpful. Specifically, authors showed that an anti-learning rule during a \""sleep phase\"" of the network, in the form of anti-Hebbian learning, could break up attractor states that were detrimental to learning (Thiele et al., 2017) . Therefore the idea of \""reverse learning\"" is different from the OBH. It differs significantly by focusing on how specific memories are destroyed (via anti-learning mechanisms like a hypothetical \""reverse STDP\"") rather than how corrupted inputs or topdown noise can improve generalization like in the OBH."", ""Dreams are preparations for real-world problems"": ""The close correlation between creativity and dreams, as well as the similarity of dreams to simulations or virtual realities, has lead to hypotheses that dreaming can be used to solve relevant real-world problems for the animal. Perhaps the most direct statement of this is the idea that dreams act as rehearsals for stereotypical behaviors for animals in a form of \""genetic programming\"" (Jouvet, 1998) . In more contemporary studies this has been referred to as the hypothesis that dreams act as protoconscious states to prepare for activities during waking behavior (Hobson, 2009) . Similar examples of this hypothesis include an interpretation based off of robots that used simulations to figure out self-models (Bongard et al., 2006) that an animal might \""dream up strategies for success\"" at night, like for how to best climb obstacles, like rocks, that it faced during the day (Adami, 2006) . Evidence for this sort of hypothesis is that there is a form of neural \""pre-play\"" wherein the sequences of activity predict future behavior of the animal (Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011) . However, in a similar manner to the replay results, it is likely that most of the time it is not the actual specific future sequences of activity, and that most sequences are never instantiated during wake.Perhaps the most general of these hypotheses of dreams as simulations for solving real-world problems is the idea that dreams are actually for refining the ability to create simulations. This \""InSim\"" hypothesis, which specifically is a hypothesis about the dreams of young children, posits that dreams are chances to create simulations and then test their predictions against the real world upon waking (Svensson and Thill, 2012) . However, this only applies to young children (with the assumption that the few studies are correct that children's dreams are more \""boring\"" than adults), since, as the authors themselves point out, adult dreams would be consistently invalidated by daily events. Indeed, the phenomenology of dreams as sparse and hallucinatory and fabulist make it unlikely that strategies or abilities or preparations that originate in dreams work at all in the real world.However, these types of theories are likely right to view dreams as simulations. Yet according to the OBH the purpose of these simulations is not to refine a particular ability or strategy or plan of ac, or to which is what simulations normally are for. Instead the purpose is to provide \""out-of-distribution\"" simulations specifically to prevent overfitting and improve generalization, wherein overfitting is essentially an unavoidable issue brought about by daily learning and therefore a constant threat to the brain's ability."", ""The overfitted brain hypothesis"": ""As technology advances science often appropriates new technologies for metaphors that help understand complex systems (Lunteren, 2016) . This has been particularly true of neuroscience (Daugman, 2001) . In the past decade it has become apparent that there are many lessons for neuroscience to be taken from brain-inspired deep neural nets (DNNs), which offer a different framework for thinking about learning than standard computer architectures. DNNs are far and away the only successful analog to human intelligence on complex tasks, and they tend to develop brain-like connectivity and representational properties, like grid-cells, shape-tuning, and visual illusions (Richards et al., 2019) . One of the most significant differences between DNNs and the brain is that updating of synaptic weights in accordance with the backpropagation of errors has traditionally been looked on as biologically unrealistic. Yet new research reveals that the brain may implement core features of backpropagation, with several viable candidates such as node perturbations or neural gradient representation by activity differences (Lillicrap et al., 2020) .Therefore there is good reason for neuroscience to look to deep learning for inspiration, since both are systems that perform complex tasks via the updating of weights within an astronomically large parameter space. It is clear that the challenges the brain and DNNs face during learning and performance on complex tasks overlap significantly. Notably, one of the most ubiquitous challenges DNNs face is a trade-off between generalization and memorization, wherein as they learn to fit one particular data set, they can become less generalizable to others. This overfitting is identifiable when performance on the training set begins to differentiate from performance on the testing set. An omnipresent problem within the deep learning community, solutions to overfitting in DNNs most often comes in the form of a noise injection, such as making input data sets corrupted and therefore less self-similar (Maaten et al., 2013) . Perhaps the most common explicit technique to prevent overfitting is dropout, which is also fundamentally the injection of noise and the corruption of input during learning (Srivastava et al., 2014) . Notably the more self-similar or biased your sampling of training data is, the more overfitting will be an issue.The brain faces these challenges as it learns, since what an organism experiences every day can be highly self-similar and biased in its sampling of the environment. The OBH states that dreams offer a biologically-realistic \""noise injection.\"" Specifically, there is good evidence that dreams are based on the stochastic percolation of signals through the cortex, activating the default-mode network (Domhoff and Fox, 2015) . Note that there is growing evidence that most of these signals originate in a top-down manner (Nir and Tononi, 2010) , meaning that the \""corrupted inputs\"" will bear statistical similarities to the models and representations of the brain. In other words, they are derived from a stochastic exploration of the generative model of the brain. This leads to the kind structured hallucinations that are common during dreams. The hallucinogenic, category-breaking, and fabulist quality of dreams means they are extremely different from the \""training set\"" of the animal, i.e., their daily experiences. The diurnal cycle of fitting to tasks during the day, and avoiding overfitting at night via a semi-random walk of experiences, may be viewed as a kind of \""simulated annealing\"" (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983) in the brain. That is, it is the very strangeness of dreams in their divergence from waking experience that gives them their biological function.To sum up: the OBH conceptualizes dreams as a form of purposefully corrupted input, likely derived from noise injected into the generative model of the brain, the overall purpose of which is to prevent overfitting. This overfitting takes the form of both specific tasks that an organism might have learned but also generalization to out-ofdistribution (unseen) novel stimuli. As will be discussed, the OBH fits well with the disparate known data about dreams, such as their physiological origin in the form of noise that creates \""corrupted features\"" via neuromodulatory influences, their role in learning, and their importance for problem solving and creativity. However, most importantly, it does not consider dreams as epiphenomena generated by some background process, and it also accounts for the actual phenomenology of dreams themselves. Their sparseness comes from the \""dropout\"" of bottom-up inputs and use of sparser or more local activity, their hallucinatory nature comes from the stochastic nature of their purposeful corrupted or warped nature away from the daily \""training set\"" the organism normally experiences, and their narrative nature from the top-down genesis of dreams since the brain understands reality in the form of stories. That is, the distinct phenomenology of dreams is to maximize their effectiveness at improving generalization. The evidence for the OBH, as well as more details about its distinguishing claims, are overviewed in the following section."", ""Evidence from neuroscience"": ""What is the evidence for the OBH from traditional methods of neuroscience? It is worth focusing not on all the studies available, but those that distinguish the OBH from the theory that dreams are correlated (in some unspecified way) with learning.In human behavioral experiments there is good supporting evidence for the OBH specifically. First, the most effective means of triggering dreams that contain partial similarities to real-life events is through repetitive overtraining on a task. Examples of this include extensive playing of games like Tetris (Stickgold et al., 2000) or ski-simulators (Wamsley and Stickgold, 2010) , which led to dreams involving the learned task, although not specific repetitions or replays of memories. Put another way: the surest way to trigger dreams about a real-world event is to perform a task repetitively during the day, preferably one that is novel. This creates the condition of the brain being overfitted to the task, which then triggers nightly dreams attempting to generalize performance on the task. Evidence of dreaming about tasks specifically improving those tasks is true of things like mirror tracing (Schredl and Erlacher, 2010) and reading with inverted goggles on (De Koninck et al., 1996) . Even driving cars seems correlated to dreams about driving (Schredl and Hofmann, 2003) . It is likely therefore there is a homeostatic component to the OBH wherein different modules, processes, or systems within the brain become overfitted from usage, which are then most likely to trigger dreams involving those modules. If so, neurons involved in recent learning would be most affected by overfitting. In this way the OBH can account for many of the statistical \""replay\"" results since those neurons that saw synaptic changes in response learning are most affected by the regularization of dreaming. But the OBH further explains why exact sequence replication is rare and most \""replay\"" is actually never-before-seen firing patterns (Gupta et al., 2010) .Another line of evidence for the OBH is that in humans there is evidence of task-dependency when it comes to whether sleep improves learning. For adult humans perceptual tasks showed little to no learning increase from sleep wherein cognitive tasks showed significant gains from learning (Doyon et al., 2009 ). Since it is likely that adult humans already have well-fitted perceptual models, we should expect complex cognitive tasks to trigger more gain from an increase in generalizability. While dream reports are actually less common in young children, particularly below the age of 7, from what can be gleaned children's dreams are much more static and perceptual, focusing on individual scenes rather than full narratives (Foulkes, 2009) . Meanwhile newborns exhibit \""active sleep,\"" their version of REM, for 50% of their 16-18 hours of daily sleep, perhaps indicating that early perceptual models are in constant danger of overfitting.The OBH is also supported by evidence that sleep does not simply improve memory directly, but affects some aspects of memory more than others. For instance, in a word association test, direct associations, the equivalent of pure memorization, did not benefit that much from a night's sleep. However, word associations were better able to resist interfering associations (Ellenbogen et al., 2006) indicating again that memorization is least affected by sleep, but generalized performance is most affected. This holds true even in babies, wherein sleep is correlated with increased generalization and abstraction abilities (Friedrich et al., 2015; G\u00f3mez et al., 2006) .Additionally, there is evidence from behavioral studies that over-training on a texture-discrimination task leads to decreased performance on it, and that sleep specifically, above and beyond the passage of time, rescues this performance (Mednick et al., 2002) . This fits with anecdotal reports of plateauing in terms of performance on a task, like a video game, only to sleep and have an increased performance the next day.There is also the long-standing traditional association between dreams and creativity, a rich literature. What are often anecdotal reports are supported by careful studies of how sleep improves abstraction and reasoning on tasks (Wagner et al., 2004; Cai et al., 2009) . This fits directly with the OBH, since an increase in generalization would directly lead to more insights in complex problems, or better performance on cognitive tasks that require creativity. Indeed, it explains the link between creativity and dreaming better than the hypotheses that dreaming is for the integration of new with old memories, the replay of memories, or their storage.Finally, it might be argued that it is a problem for the OBH that dreams are generally amnesiac, with explicit memory a rarity during dreams. Would it not be strange then that the content of dreams have any effect on the abilities of a neural network? Here, an important distinction should be made between accessing explicit declarative memories and the general fact that learning involves changes to synapses. For instance, the amnesiac effect during sleep may due to prefrontal inhibition. Just as prefrontal cortex inhibition means that dreams are not recognizable as dreams when they are occurring, it may be that the same inhibition makes it difficult to recall in the sense of cognitive access (Siclari and Tononi, 2016) . Anecdotal evidence from those with dream journals suggests that paying attention to dreams makes them easier to remember, lending credence to this hypothesis (Robb, 2018) . Additionally, sudden-waking experiments show that dream content is common and recallable. Likely the effects of not being able to either form or access episodic memories of all dreams at the end of the night are due to the neuromodulatory milieu during sleep.Supporting the OBH is evidence indicating that dreams lead to synaptic changes in the connectivity of the brain, albeit likely this is not as strongly as waking experience, with episodic memory storage significantly reduced. What is the evidence that synapses change during sleep? Proponents of SHY have argued that there is evidence that synapses change during sleep in the form of synaptic homeostasis, regularization which occurs every night in the form of universal down-scaling of synaptic strength (Bushey et al., 2011) . However, this has been challenged by the observation of potentiation during sleep (Durkin and Aton, 2016) . In general it appears that whether there is net potentiation or depression during waking depends on the task (Fisher et al., 2016) , indicating that learning involves synaptic plasticity in both directions in both wake and sleep (Raven et al., 2018) . If during dreams synapses are indeed still plastic, then dreams can leave a synaptic trace that can affect performance."", ""Evidence from deep learning"": ""One of the most significant, and ubiquitous, challenges any deep neural network faces is the ability to generalize beyond the data set it has been trained on. There has been significant effort in the past decade by the deep learning community to develop methods and techniques to avoid overfitting on particular data sets and, at the broadest level, to allow for extrapolation to never-before-seen data sets. This section overviews three commonly used such techniques within deep learning (and research into artificial neural networks generally). Notably, each embodies some phenomenological property of dreams.First, there is the method of dropout, perhaps the most widely-used technique for preventing overfitting in deep learning (Achille and Soatto, 2018) . Dropout occurs during the training of a network, when inputs are made sparse by randomly \""dropping out\"" some of them, a form of regularization during learning which is mathematically similar to a noise injection (Srivastava et al., 2014) . It is important to note that dreams resemble dropout in their spareness, as they do not contain as much perceptual information, or details in general, as waking experiences. This likely increases the salience of relevant features while minimizing irrelevant features, assisting in generalization by making representations more robust and invariant. Dreams are a lesser or weakened state of conscious experience because of this dropping out of bottom-up stimuli, lacking much of the detail of waking conscious experiences, which, according to the OBH actually assists, rather than hinders, their function.Second, there is the method of domain randomization used in training deep neural networks. In domain randomization, the inputs during learning are \""randomized\"" in the sense of being warped or corrupted in particular ways. This can drastically assist with learning and generalization. Paradoxically, simulating hallucinatory inputs rather than learning off of real inputs helps deep neural networks learn real-world tasks (Tobin et al., 2017) . Domain randomization has have been used in cutting-edge techniques in deep learning, such as being necessary for having a DNN solve a Rubik's Cube using a robot hand (Akkaya et al., 2019) . Domain randomization resembles the hallucinatory quality of dreams in that dreams depart significantly from normal experiences, as if they have been randomly drawn from a varied set of different domains.Of course, the implementation of these techniques must be different for the brain. This is because the brain faces many challenges that artificial neural networks do not. Any organism that implemented dropout or domain randomization during its daily learning would face serious survival issues. Therefore, in order to increase generality and avoid overfitting a dedicated offline period is needed. Sleep, possibly having originally evolved for other housekeeping reasons, is the perfect time.The third common practice in deep learning that has ties to dreaming is the use of fully simulated data via some generative model. A generative model is when a neural network is trained on data from a domain to output generated data that looks as if it came from the domain but that the network itself generates. Generative models lie behind the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and other techniques that allow for cutting-edge performance on complex tasks using sets of feedforward networks that anticipate the other's output (Goodfellow et al., 2014) . It is worth noting that GANs and others often produce notoriously dream-like fabulist outputs (Hertzmann, 2019) . Indeed, recently an external generative model that created \""dream-like\"" input helped train a DNN to produce the code behind a given mathematical mapping (Ellis et al., 2020) . It should be noted that in all these cases the generative model exists outside the network itself, which is not biologically realistic in the case of the brain.But what about cases where the network itself acts the generative model? In networks that are not purely feedfoward or have external models that can be manipulated by experimenters, the stimulation of higher layers (generally through the injection of noise) can lead to patterns of activity in the lower layers that recapitulate the statistical properties of inputs, as if the network were being stimulated from the bottom-up from imaginary sources. This is likely the case in the brain, wherein stochastic activity high in the hierarchy of brain regions creates hallucinatory patterns of inputs. It is worth noting that the proposal of a \""wake/sleep\"" specific algorithm for unsupervised learning of generative models based on feedback from stochastic stimulation goes back 25 years (Hinton et al., 1995) . While there have even been suggestions that the purpose of sleep involves the \""wake/sleep\"" algorithm itself (Sejnowski, 1995) , this algorithm is only for a form of unsupervised learning that creates a generative model and requires several assumptions that are not biologically realistic, like only training one set of connections at a time. It is also clear the brain does much more than just learn a lone generative model. However, it is likely the case that dreams are indeed a result of the brain's internal generative model in the form of its feedback connectivity, which fits with the evidence that dreams are \""top-down\"" (Foulkes and Domhoff, 2014) . If dreams are from a similar top-down generative model composed of feedback connectivity, this fits with evidence that dreaming drawn from the brain's generative model becomes more narrative and complex over time, particu-larly during adolescence (Strauch, 2005) . By adulthood, dreams take on the narrative structure of human cognition wherein stories and metaphors make up the core function of thought (Lakoff and Johnson, 2008) . Since narratives are the way by which human brains understand the world (Lakoff, 2008) , the generative model of the brain produces narratives, which act as hallucinatory and sparse \""fake\"" input for learning, thus combating overfitting and improving generalization. In this way they are a direct expansion of the normal \""training set\"" of an animal, since narratives are how conscious perception itself proceeds (James, 2007) .Overall, while there is no one exact method in deep learning that matches precisely with the OBH, overlapping aspects of common methods in the field for mitigating overfitting and assisting generalization lend credence to the idea that the evolved function of dreaming is for precisely these purposes."", ""Predictions"": ""The OBH puts together several lines of investigation under one roof by being explicit about asking how generalization during learning can benefit from dreams. This involves understanding how dreams can help overcome an organism's reliance on just the day's events, which are often highly statistically biased. The theory makes a number of specific predictions which can be pursued both experimentally as well as theoretically."", ""Experimental validation"": ""Experimental investigation of the OBH within neuroscience can consist of several components. Under the OBH, much of the benefit of dreaming is in the realm of generalizability not memorization per se, and this can be differentiated with well-designed behavioral tests. For example, it may be that direct measurement of overfitting is possible in humans. This may include the training of subjects on overly repetitious tasks in order to ensure the condition of overfitting. It may also include using similar techniques as those within deep learning to test for generalization of performance. Beyond behavioral predictions and subsequent studies, there is also the possibility of attempting to track synaptic plasticity in response to dreams. This may include things like tracking changes in dendritic spine morphology during REM.Notably, the sort of cognitive flexibility and generalization the OBH claims is the purpose of dreams is highly important for workers and those in the armed forces who sometimes operate under sleep deprivation during critical periods, which can lead to increased accident rates (Powell and Copping, 2010) , and has a significant monetary annual impact (Leger, 1994) . If it is true that sleep-deprived brains are overfitted, they will be prone to make errors in stereotypical ways. Thus it may be easier to know what types of mistakes will be made by individuals operating in sleep-deprived states and in response build more robust fail-safes. Furthermore, there is the possibility of dream substitutions: dream-like stimuli that are artificially generated to have the properties of dreams, and therefore have a similar ameliorative effect on overfitting. Such dream substitutions, delivered via VR or even video, might provide a simple yet effective mean for delaying some of sleep deprivation's cognitive defects. The impact of substitutions can be examined both behaviorally but also at the neurophysiological level of REM rebound (Ocampo-Garc\u00e9s et al., 2000) ."", ""Theoretical validation"": ""The OBH has consequences not just for neuroscience, but also for the field of deep learning. This is particularly true of biologically-realistic models, like large-scale thalamocortical spiking-neuron models, which have previously been used to investigate the development of cortical connectivity and its effect on slow waves (Hoel et al., 2016) . It is likely that biologically-realistic spiking neurons which are still trainable in the manner of DNNs (Hazan et al., 2018) can be used to explore the benefits of dreams directly. In such a cortical model, neuromodulation can be used to be intersperse training with periods that mimic sleep stages, cycling first through the real input of its training set, and then hallucinatory corrupted input generated from its top-down connections. This should prevent or delay overfitting.What sort of stochastic biases allow for dreams to warp input data in a way that is most efficient for avoiding overfitting? If the OBH is correct, then the sparse and hallucinatory nature of dreams suggest that we should expect warping of input distributions that successfully combats overfitting has these qualities. Such distributions should be sparse in that they have less entries than normal inputs, and hallucinatory in that they should be clustered in a different way compared to the standard \""daily\"" input.It may be that investigating these questions could lead to methods useful for the field of deep learning itself, particularly those that are more biologically-realistic in their operations. For instance, as discussed in the previous section, it may be hypothesized that phases of dream-like confabulation in DNNs to increase generalization and prevent overfitting will work most effectively with a using lower learning rate than normal training, since this mimics the semi-amnesiac effect of dreams."", ""Discussion"": ""The Overfitted Brain Hypothesis (OBH) posits the evolved purpose of dreams is to assist generalization, mainly by combating the highly biased nature of inputs during an animal's daily learning that can lead to overfitting. It is supported by both empirical evidence (Section 3.1) and theoretical evidence (Section 3.2). In many cases it can explain observed results better than other hypotheses (comparative hypotheses are discussed in Section 2). For example, it seems the most effective way to trigger dreams about something is to have subjects perform on a novel task like Tetris repetitiously (Stickgold et al., 2001a; Wamsley and Stickgold, 2010) , likely because the visual system has became overfitted to the task. Additionally, the OBH explains why \""replay\"" results more often contain never-before-see patterns of activity than actual replays of waking sequences (Gupta et al., 2010) . In another example, it explains the fact that synaptic potentiation occurs during sleep (Durkin and Aton, 2016) , indicating that learning during dreams themselves leaves behind a synaptic trace.The OBH does not necessarily contradict other hypotheses about sleep, for instance, the idea that during certain periods of sleep there is ongoing metabolic waste clearance (Xie et al., 2013) . In this sense then the OBH speculates that dreaming evolved as an exaptation, wherein sleep evolved for molecular housekeeping purposes and only when brains had to significantly learn during the organism's lifetime did the goal of avoiding overfitting and increasing generalization become adaptive. Additionally, it does not compete with other functional hypotheses about dreams, which may be accomplished at the same time. For instance, it may be that dreams are also a test-bed for strengthening the brain's generative model and therefore ability to generate mental imagery during wake, explaining the complexification of dreams from childhood to adulthood (Foulkes, 2009) . So there may be multiple functions to dreams at different timescales. It is also worth noting that dream's role in improving generalization might also be combating related things like \""catastrophic forgetting,\"" which is a problem faced by DNNs that try to train on multiple tasks, and which can also be prevented or alleviated by methods like dropout or more complicated techniques like elastic weight consolidation (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017) . Recent research shows that stimuli created from a network's generative model (which are, according to the OBH, similar to dreams), can indeed help avoid catastrophic forgetting (Raghavan et al., 2019) . So while issues like catastrophic forgetting (the complete unlearning of a task while learning another) is not well documented in humans, it may be that the brain faces some lesser form of it, and dreams can be conceptualized as a form of regularization that may ameliorate several aspects of common learning failures simultaneously.Perhaps the most distinguishing aspect of the OBH is that it takes the phenomenology of dreams seriously, in that they are sparse, hallucinogenic, and narrative in the sense of containing fabulist and unusual events. The OBH emphasizes that it is precisely because of the departure from waking life that dreams evolved. According to this hypothesis dreams are not epiphenomena, either in the sense of neutral evolution but also in the sense of not being an expression of some other background process, such as patterns of activity and associated experiences merely brought about by some other processing integrating new memories (Wamsley, 2014) . Rather, the point of dreams is the dreams themselves, since they provide departures away from the statistically-biased input of an animal's daily life, which can assist with generalization and therefore performance. It may seem paradoxical, but a dream of flying may actually help you keep your balance running. The evidence for this possibility comes from common methods in deep learning which improve generalization, such as dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) , domain randomization (Tobin et al., 2017) , and the use of input data created by stochastic stimulation of generative models (Ellis et al., 2020) , which together bear striking similarities to the properties of dreams.The OBH makes several predictions that are useful for both the field of neuroscience and the field of deep learning. These include predictions on the neurophysiological level, as well as behavioral, and even within the field of deep learning. For instance, the prediction that inputs with dream-like properties, i.e., adhering to dream phenomenology, will assist with overfitting in DNNs. Behaviorally, overfitting might be induced in subjects via through repetitive training on an under-sampled task, and the benefit of dreaming might be directly measured. There is also the possibility of dream substitutions, wherein artificial dream-like stimuli might help improve generalization and therefore performance in sleep-deprived individuals.Finally, it is worth taking the idea of dream substitutions seriously enough to consider whether fictions, like novels or films, act as artificial dreams, accomplishing at least some of the same function. Within evolutionary psychology, the attempt to ground aspects of human behavior in evolutionary theory, there has been long-standing confusion with regard to human interest in fictions, since on their surface fictions have no utility. They are, after all, explicitly false information. Therefore it has been thought that fictions are either demonstrations of cognitive fitness in order to influence mate choice (Hogh-Olesen, 2018), or can simply be reduced to the equivalent of \""cheesecake\"" -gratifying to consume but without benefit. Proponents of this view have even gone so far as to describe the arts as a \""pleasure technology\"" (Pinker, 1997) . However, the OBH suggests fictions, and perhaps the arts in general, may actually have an underlying cognitive utility in the form of improving generalization and preventing overfitting, since they act as artificial dreams.""}",The Overfitted Brain: Dreams evolved to assist generalization,"Understanding of the evolved biological function of NREM and slow wave sleep has advanced considerably in the past decade. However, no equivalent understanding of REM sleep and dreams has emerged. Contemporary neuroscientific theories generally view dreams as epiphenomena, and the few proposals for their biological function are contradicted by the phenomenology of dreams themselves. Now, the recent advent of deep neural networks (DNNs) has finally provided the novel conceptual framework within which to understand the evolved function of dreams. Notably, all DNNs face the issue of overfitting as they learn, which is when performance on one data set increases but the network's performance fails to generalize (often measured by the divergence of performance on training vs testing data sets). This ubiquitous problem in DNNs is often solved by experimenters via""noise injections""in the form of noisy or corrupted inputs. The goal of this paper is to argue that the brain faces a similar challenge of overfitting, and that nightly dreams evolved to combat the brain's overfitting during its daily learning. That is, dreams are a biological mechanism for increasing generalizability. Sleep loss, specifically dream loss, leads to an overfitted brain that can still memorize and learn but fails to generalize appropriately. Herein this""overfitted brain hypothesis""is explicitly developed and then compared and contrasted with existing contemporary neuroscientific theories of dreams. Existing evidence for the hypothesis is surveyed within both neuroscience and deep learning, and a set of testable predictions are put forward that can be pursued both in vivo and in silico.",,ArXiv,,,arxiv,2020-07-19,,,,2007.0956,220646989.0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09560v1.pdf,2020.0,paper

Up to December 2014, a total of 904 people in 23 different countries were infected by the virus with a resultant of 38.4 % mortality rate [2] . Transmission of the virus from human to human was previously reported especially in health workers facilities [3] . Recently, an evidence of viral transmission from dromedary camel to human is reported [4] .Previous studies carried out in UAE in Dubai Emirate have shown the wide spread of MERS-CoV antibodies in dromedary camels [5, 6] . Globally, UAE ranks as the second country after Saudi Arabia in terms of the number of human beings infected with MERS-CoV [2] .Moreover, sixty-five of the total 67 human cases in UAE occurred in Abu Dhabi Emirate. The emirate also harbors approximately 80 % of the country's camel population and is subjected to a continuous camel population movement throughout the year from the neighboring countries including Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Qatar which can play a vital role in spreading viral infection to other animals or humans.Despite this, no molecular survey of MERS-CoV in camels has been carried out in the entire country to the best of our knowledge. Thus, a systematic epidemiological survey using molecular techniques to detect and identify risk factors associated with MERS-CoV in camels in Abu Dhabi Emirate is needed. This, in turn, will provide a base to devise a suitable control strategy of this disease in humans and animals."", ""Sample collection"": ""The study was carried out during the period (February-September 2014) at Abu Dhabi Food Control Authority (ADFCA) Veterinary Laboratory-Abu Dhabi-UAE using a total of 7,803 nasal swab samples collected from camels at different locations in Abu Dhabi Emirate. These include public escorts and zoos (30 samples), slaughter houses (303 samples), 4,617 and 2,853 samples from borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman, respectively.All swabs were transferred to ADFCA veterinary laboratory in a universal transport medium TM (Copan, Italy) within 24 h after collection. Personal-protective equipment including N95 masks, goggles, disposable gowns, gloves, and head covers was used during samples collection, transport, and testing.Nucleic acid extraction, polymerase chain reactions, and sequencing RNA was extracted from nasal swabs, according to the manufacturer's instructions using QiaAmp Viral RNA Mini kit and EZ1 Virus mini kit from Qiagen (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany).For testing, two published MERS-CoV [7, 8] reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were performed, one was used as a screening assay, which targets the upstream of the E protein gene (UpE) and the other one was used as a confirmation assay, which targets the open reading frame (ORF)1a gene region. Both assays were provided in the kit by Molbiol (ModularDx Kit Coronavirus SA1 (EMC) upstream E-gene and Light Mix Modular MERS-CoV Orf1a). The open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) gene region was also tested before being replaced by Orf1a. All assays were optimized for Roche LightCycler 1.5 and 2.0 real-time PCR system. 20 lL of total reaction was prepared from 5 lL extracted RNA, 0.5 lL reaction mix of UpE or Orf1a from the kit, 4.0 lL Roche Real-time ready RNA Virus Master, 0.1 lL RT enzyme, and 10.4 lL PCR-grade water. The thermal cycling condition and detection procedure of Light Cycler were set according to the manufacturer (MolBiol Roche Diagnostics). Positive samples were further confirmed by sequencing the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), nucleocapsid (N) gene regions, and five different partial fragments comprising ORF1a, ORF1ab, Spike1, Spike2, and NSP4 genes from selected sequences as previously described [9] ."", ""Analysis of sequence data"": ""Sequences were first aligned with ClustalW. Phylogenetic analyses based on the ORF1a, ORF1ab, Spike1, Spike2, and NSP4 partial sequences of MERS-CoV obtained from seven UAE camels together with 11 camels and 44 human MERS-CoV published sequences were carried out using MEGA version 5 [10] . The evolutionary distances were estimated using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Kimura 2-parameter model. Bootstrap analyses were performed with 1,000 repeat samples of the datasets. Camel-4, Camel-6, Camel-8, and Camel-18 were obtained from the border with Saudi Arabia, Camel-12 and Sequences from the present study (colored closed symbols) are named as follows: UAE-Camel-PP, where PP is the number of strains.

Although some camel sequences obtained from UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar tend to be grouped separately in the phylogenetic tree, they were located within cluster (B) along with other human-derived MERS-CoV sequences obtained from the same countries (Fig. 1) ."", ""Discussion"": ""MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels has been reported to be mainly restricted in the Arabian Peninsula countries [9] . This infection in dromedary camels in UAE has been determined by the detection of viral-neutralizing antibodies in sera samples previously collected in 2003 and 2005 [5, 6] . However, no systematic survey has been carried out targeting the detection of viral genome in animals in UAE. Consequently, the present study is believed to be the first molecular survey of MERS-CoV in UAE. The study was based on the screening of nasal swab samples by a real-time PCR assay targeting the UpE and ORF1a genes and characterizing the genetic diversity of the ORF1a, ORF1ab, Spike1, Spike2, and NSP4 of MERS-CoV genome sequences.In this study, MERS-CoV was detected in 1.6 % of the total 7,803 screened. The detection of MERS-CoV genome in dromedary camels in UAE is the first to be reported here. The 1.6 % molecular prevalence observed here is lower when compared with the previously reported (97 %) MERS-CoV seroprevalence in UAE [6] . The high prevalence of antibodies against MERS-CoV resulted from previous infection might protect dromedary camels against infection. In contrast, it has also been reported that prior infection or passively acquired maternal antibody might not provide a complete protection from infection [11] . Whether one of the two hypotheses is correct will necessitate further investigation. It should be noted that the absence of clear clinical signs or observed mortalities in MERS-CoV-infected camels may represent potential danger of camels serving as reservoir for human infections.MERS-CoV genome was detected here with different rates in camels nasal swabs obtained from different locations including slaughter houses located within Abu Dhabi Emirate or from borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman. Specifically, higher infection rate was observed in camels at slaughter houses when compared to borders, whereas no virus was detected in public escorts and zoos. This indicates that the former two locations could represent higher hot spots for potential human and animal infections. It should be noted that even though no clinical signs of a disease were observed in all personnel who were in direct contact with the infected camels in all locations, some personnel was seropositive to MERS-CoV (data not shown). Whether such antibodies against MERS-CoV are protective needs further investigation. Moreover, the detection of MERS-CoV in camel shipments crossing borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman reflects that animal movement between countries is participating in the spread of the virus in the Arabian Peninsula among either animals or humans. Thus, it is necessary to investigate such locations when conducting systematic surveillances or prior to establishing disease control programs.The observed clustering of MERS-CoV sequences obtained from camels in UAE together with MERS-CoV derived from both humans and camels in the same geographical region indicates a common source of origin. In addition, it provides further evidence of zoonosis and cross-species transmission of MERS-CoV between humans and dromedary camels. However, the direction of transmission between humans and camels remains unclear, which could be elucidated by further amplifying and comparing complete genome sequences obtained from humans and camels in UAE.In conclusion, this is the first report of molecular detection of MERS-CoV in camels in UAE. The virus was shown to circulate in camels crossing borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman and in camels at slaughter houses within Abu Dhabi Emirate. The molecular prevalence of the virus was found to be lower than the previously reported serological one. MERS-CoV sequences obtained from camels in UAE were clustering with human-and camel-derived MERS-CoV sequences in the same geographic area. The study can provide a basis for future epidemiological research and control.""}","Prevalence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in dromedary camels in Abu Dhabi Emirate, United Arab Emirates","High seroprevalence of Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) in dromedary camels has been previously reported in United Arab Emirates (UAE). However, the molecular detection of the virus has never been reported before in UAE.

Positive camels were detected at the borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman and in camels’ slaughter houses. MERS-CoV partial sequences obtained from UAE camels were clustering with human- and camel-derived MERS-CoV sequences in the same geographic area. Results provide further evidence of MERS-CoV zoonosis.",10.1007/s11262-015-1174-0,Medline; PMC,PMC7088545,25653016.0,no-cc,2015-02-05,Virus Genes,,,,19002938.0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25653016/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-015-1174-0,2015.0,paper

Etiological agent causing SARS is a plus-stranded RNA virus classified as a Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Holmes, 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Fouchier et al., 2003) . SARS is associated with significant morbidity, and mortality rates are estimated to be between 10 and 15% . Through SARS antiviral discovery efforts, we identified interferon alfacon1 as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV replication. Recently, interferon alfacon1 was used combined with cortical steroids, in a preliminary pilot study, to assess potential clinical benefit and safety for patients infected with SARS-CoV (Loutfy et al., 2003) . The study suggested that interferon alfacon1 was safe and further suggested a therapeutic benefit (Loutfy et al., 2003) . In this report, we described the in vitro activity of interferon alfacon1.Interferons are cytokines induced as a consequence of viral infections and have pleiotropic biological effects that play a role in modulating innate and adaptive immunity. Type 1 interferons (alpha/beta) have been effective for treating plus-stranded RNA viral diseases such hepatitis C virus (Tong et al., 1997) and the human coronavirus 229E, which causes a mild upper respiratory infection (Sperber and Hayden, 1989) . Others have reported that type 1 interferons can inhibit SARS-CoV replication in vitro (Cinatl et al., 2003; Hensley et al., 2004; Haagmans et al., 2004; Enserink, 2004; Cinatl et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2004; Moriguchi and Sato, 2003; Stroher et al., 2004) . Furthermore type 1 interferon has been evaluated in experimentally infected non-human primates (Enserink, 2004) . To date interferon alfacon1 is the only interferon tested in human trials (Loutfy et al., 2003) . We examined the in vitro antiviral activity of this non-naturally occurring type 1 interferon, interferon alfacon1 (Infergen \u00ae ) (Ozes et al., 1992) cell-culture assays of SARS-CoV. Interferon alfacon1 is a second-generation cytokine that was engineered to contain the most frequently occurring amino acids among the non-allelic interferon alpha subtypes (Blatt et al., 1996) . This molecule is unique to the naturally occurring interferons. In cell-culture models, interferon alfacon1 demonstrates increased potency when compared to naturally occurring type 1 interferons (Blatt et al., 1996) and is a more potent inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus replication in comparative clinical trials with naturally occurring type 1 interferons (Tong et al., 1997) . Interferon alfacon1 has been successfully evaluated for treating chronic hepatitis C virus infections (Suzuki and Tango, 2002) .In an in vitro CPE assay (Ishitsuka et al., 1977; Imanishi et al., 1981) , interferon alfacon1 was able to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in a dose-dependent manner. Confluent Vero76 cells in 96-well plates were treated with 1 g/ml to 1 pg/ml of interferon alfacon1 and incubated at 37 \u2022 C. Vero cells are a responsive substrate for human interferons (Julkunen et al., 1982) . Twenty-four hours pretreatment, 0 h, 24 h posttreatment, and 48 h posttreatment cells were infected with the Urbani strain of the SARS-CoV virus (Ksiazek et al., 2003) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01. The cells were incubated at 37 \u2022 C for an additional 72 h before they were stained with the vital cell dye neutral red as a marker for cell viability (Imanishi et al., 1981) . Stained cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed with neutral buffered formalin. Neutral red was assayed by using an optical plate reader set at 450 nm. Optical density data were collected and inhibitory concentration 50% (IC 50 ) and toxicity concentration 50% (TC 50 ) were determined using a four parameter fit algorithm.In vitro CPE assay, interferon alfacon1 had an IC 50 of 0.001 g/ml and TC 50 of greater than 1 g/ml in repeated experiments at the 24 posttreatment timepoint. No other times had detectable activity against SARS-CoV induced CPE. In a similar assay, ribavirin had no effect on the replication of SARS-CoV while interferon alfacon1 provided complete protection at the highest doses and a linear dose response at the lower part of the concentration curve. Interferon alfacon1 was also assayed in combination with interferon gamma. No detectable synergy was observed beyond the activity of interferon alfacon1.Interferon alfacon1 was further tested in a SARS-CoV plaque reduction assay. Confluent Vero cells were pre-treated by supplementing the cell-culture medium with interferon al-facon1 at 100 ng/ml for 24 h. Treated or sham-treated (control) cells were infected with approximately 30 pfu of one of three different isolates of SARS-CoV (TOR2, TOR3, or Urbani) (Ksiazek et al., 2003; Marra et al., 2003) for 1 h. After the 1 h adsorption, cells were washed two times with PBS and then overlaid with solid medium containing E-MEM, 1% fetal bovine serum, 1% agarose supplemented with 100 ng/ml of interferon alfacon1. Cells were incubated for and additional 72 h before being staining with a 0.5% solution of neutral red/PBS solution. Twenty-four hours poststaining, Fig. 1 . Neutral red-stained cell cultures of a plaque reduction assay comparing the sensitivities of three isolates of SARS-CoV. Rows (A)-(C) show data of cells infected with the isolates TOR2, TOR7, and URBANI, respectively. The last column shows data from cells that were interferon alfacon1 treated but mock infected. stained cell cultures were photographed. Interferon alfacon1 was able to inhibited plaque formation by all three SARS-CoV isolates (Fig. 1, column 2) in comparison to the sham treatment (Fig. 1, column 1) . Differences in plaque size were not reproducible among the different isolates. Treatment with interferon alfacon1 alone did not affect cell viability (Fig. 1 , column 3) based on neutral red uptake.Interferon alfacon1 was further evaluated in a yield reduction assay over a 96 h time course. Confluent Vero cells were pretreated with interferon alfacon1 at 100 ng/ml for 24 h, and then infected with each of the three SARS-CoV isolates. Viral cultures were sampled at 24 h intervals and samples were stored at \u221270 \u2022 C. Viral titers of the samples were assayed by plaque assay on Vero76 cells as described above. Titers are plotted in a line graph (Fig. 2) . Interferon alfacon1 blocked viral production at 24 h postinfec- Fig. 2 . Line graph of a yield-reduction experiment. Pfu/ml are plotted on the X-axis and time is plotted on the Y-axis. The open symbols are treated data and the closed symbols are sham-treated data. Each of the following shapes represents a different SARS-CoV isolate: the diamonds represent TOR2, the squares are TOR7, and the triangles are Urbani. tion in comparison to mock-treated cells. By 48 h, interferon alfacon1 had reduced the replication of SARS-CoV isolates TOR2 and TOR7 by 4 logs compared to replication in the mock-treated cells, while the Urbani isolate remained completely inhibited. Seventy-two hours postinfection, treated cultures infected with TOR2 and TOR7 reached the peak titers of 10 6 pfu/ml. This represents a 3-log reduction compared to the untreated. The Urbani isolate remained completely inhibited. At the 96 h time point, the Urbani isolate had achieved a peak viral titer of 4 logs of virus, which was 3 logs less than titers in the untreated control. Cell cultures were stained with crystal violet and photographed (Fig. 3) .Infected cells treated with interferon alfacon1 appeared to be protected from CPE based on crystal violet staining. The staining pattern of the interferon alfacon1-treated infected cells (Fig. 3, column 2 ) was similar to the staining pattern in the uninfected cells (Fig. 3, column 1) . The shamtreated infected cells (Fig. 3, column 3 ) had extensive CPE compared to the treated and mock-infected (Fig. 3, columns  1 and 2) . There was no detectable CPE macroscopically or microscopically. This result is surprising when compared to the viral titer data. TOR2 and TOR7 both had peak titers of 10 6 pfu/ml and the Urbani isolate had peak titer of 10 4 pfu/ml from a cell free cell culture media sample (Fig. 2) . Interferon alfacon1 appeared to protect cells from CPE despite limited viral replication. Therefore, given the proven efficacy and safety of interferon alfacon1 in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, a flavivirus infection, effective anti-coronavirus doses are potentially achievable in patients (Suzuki and Tango, 2002) . The potent ability of interferon alfacon1 to protect cells from virus-induced CPE suggests that the compound inhibits viral replication (Fig. 1) . This is further substantiated by the yield reduction and plaque reduction assays suggesting that interferon alfacon1 is an effective antiviral against multiple isolates of SARS-CoV. In the yield-reduction experiment, as a model, the reduction and the delay to peak titers may allow the infected individual more time to effectively contain the virus. It is interesting that despite viral replication at the late times of infection in the yield-reduction assay (Figs. 2 and 3) , there was no detectable CPE (Fig. 3) .Potentially, interferon alfacon1 may function as an antiviral therapeutic for treating SARS patients and exposed individuals (Loutfy et al., 2003) . Interferon alfacon1 most likely induces an antiviral state in the cell, which results in a cellular environment that is not favorable to viral replication. Interferon alfacon1 does induce a number of cellular antiviral factors (Blatt et al., 1996) . However, attempts to treat infected cells postinfection with interferon alfacon1 did not show activity the CPE based assays and in yield reduction experiments (data not shown), suggesting that interferon al-facon1 maybe not directly block viral replication in cells that are already infected. Rather interferon alfacon1 may suppress viral spread to uninfected cells by making the cells refractory to viral infection (Levy and Garcia-Sastre, 2001; Basler and Garcia-Sastre, 2002) . This is part of the normal cellular response to type 1 interferon treatment. This may also suggest that SARS-CoV contains a viral gene product that functions as an interferon antagonist like other RNA viruses (Levy and Garcia-Sastre, 2001; Basler and Garcia-Sastre, 2002) . Further investigations of the in vitro mechanisms of interferon alfacon1 are needed. Our results suggest that interferon al-facon1 has the in vitro ability to inhibit SARS-CoV replication. Interferon alfacon1 potential as a therapeutic agent for patients acutely ill from SARS awaits further investigation.""}",Interferon alfacon1 is an inhibitor of SARS-corona virus in cell-based models,"Preliminary data examining interferon alfacon1 treatment of SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus)-infected patients suggests this therapy is well tolerated and of therapeutic benefit. We report herein that interferon alfacon1, has potent in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV. In a cytopathic effect protection (CPE) assay, interferon alfacon1 inhibited the generation of CPE in a dose-dependent manner with an IC(50) of 0.001 μg/ml, a clinically achievable level. Furthermore, interferon alfacon1 also demonstrated significant antiviral activity in yield reduction and plaque reduction assays. The in vitro antiviral activity of interferon alfacon1 against SARS-CoV suggests continued evaluation of interferon alfacon1 as a therapeutic treatment for patients infected with SARS-CoV.",10.1016/j.antiviral.2005.01.002,Elsevier; Medline; PMC,PMC7114208,15911026.0,no-cc,2005-02-15,Antiviral Res,,,,1661513.0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15911026/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354205000264; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354205000264,2005.0,paper

In particular, merging nanomaterials with different properties have opened a new horizon for multifunctional nanostructures within a single platform. For example, novel nanostructures that combine, plasmonic and magnetic properties can lead to high sensitive and cost-effective biosensors, providing important improvements in patient care and at the same time reduce costs, contribute to the efficiency of the hospital logistics, and enhance safety, allowing the early detection of specific biomarkers at a single molecule level [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] .With the increasing interest in the development and implementation of accessible and affordable \""personalized medicine\"", nanomedicine is expected to provide solutions for early diagnosis and targeted therapy. Such expectations are projected in different paths and include inexpensive rapid tests for genetic predisposition, viral infection and the first signs of diseases long before symptoms manifest themselves [6] . Biomarkers are very important as they allow early diagnosis and intervention prior to the occurrence of potentially serious clinical events. They can be used to establish the prognosis of patient and help to plan the treatment. In addition they can provide early information about the efficacy of treatment and indicate whether to continue, switch or stop the therapy [7, 8] . For example, in the field of oncology, when tumor cells die, they release circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) into the blood. Scientists recourse to liquid biopsy to detect and purify ctDNA, thus, the purified biomaterial is analyzed using advanced and complex technique in the field of genomics such as digital PCR, next generation sequencing (NGS), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and BEAMing [9, 10] . However, these techniques require an operation by specialized personnel in large infrastructures such as hospitals or research centres. Currently, most of the reported results are performed in optimal laboratory settings as a proof-of-concept for specific biomarkers, instead of using complex environment (e.g., whole blood, urine, cells), where the mixture of biomolecules and ions often provoke false signals and reduced the sensitivity [11] . Extensive studies have proven that plasmonic nanoparticles (especially gold) exhibit properties that facilitate their implementation in molecular assays for the detection of genetic mutations in biological samples. However the response of those systems, relies exclusively on the color change of the sample [12, 13] .The term \""Magnetophoresis\"" is used to describe the motion of magnetic particles when brought under a magnetic field gradient. Nowadays, magnetophoresis is being used in a wide range of research and technological areas ranging from environment remediation to biomedical applications [14, 15] . Numerous applications, encompassing wastewater treatments [16] [17] [18] , pollutant removal [19] , biomolecules isolation, drug delivery, and magnetic-particle imaging [20] [21] [22] , have been developed. Within biomedical applications, magnetic separation enables the separation and isolation of targeted biological materials such as proteins, cells, small biomolecules from complex mixtures, by the use of superparamagnetic colloids. Generally, these superparamagnetic colloids present a spherical shape with sizes ranging from a few tens of nanometers to microns. These nanostructures, are commonly made by embedding superparamagnetic nanocrystals in a nonmagnetic matrix such as polystyrene or nanoporous silica [23] [24] [25] [26] . Other nanostructures consist of magnetic nanoparticles coated with inorganic materials such as Au, Ag or silica, resulting in core/shell nanostructures [27, 28] . Prior to their use as magnetic carriers, the surfaces of these nanostructures are modified, so that they bind to the targeted biological material in a solution to produce magnetic biological composites. In the particular case of genetic and pathogenic disease detection, the surface of the particles can be modified by grafting complementary oligonucleotides. Thus, a magnetic field is applied to the sample (commonly a complex colloidal mixture) to drive the magnetic biological complex towards selected regions of the containing vessel, enabling the separation of the solid content from the liquid mixture, and thus the removal of the liquid phase [29] [30] [31] .The emphasis of the present work is on the magnetophoretic separation, and isolation of small biomolecules such as single-stranded-DNA. Particularly, this report addresses a new and sensitive UV-vis spectroscopy assisted-magnetophoresis method for the monitoring of the hybridization process of twenty-mer complementary oligonucleotides (hereafter TB1 and TB2). For this purpose, two batches of magnetic particles are separately functionalized with TB1 and TB2. When the magnetic particles from two different batches are mixed and incubated, colloidal aggregates composed of the magnetic particles, TB1, and TB2 are formed as a result of the hybridization process. The aggregates, when brought under a uniform magnetic field gradient, move at a different velocity than the initial non-functionalized magnetic particles. The velocity of the formed agglomerates depends on their resulting magnetic strength, which is quantified with the parameter \u0393. This behavior induces an important difference in the magnetic separation time of the formed aggregates, which is optically monitored by measuring the real time transparency of the colloidal suspension at specific wavelengths. The method is highly sensitive as it allows the detection of aggregates at concentrations of 0.001% w/v. Moreover, the aggregates concentrate in the region where the magnetic field is maximum (on the walls of the recipient containing the suspension), allowing their collection for further analyses."", ""Materials and methods"": ""Carboxyl polystyrene (PS) magnetic particles (hereafter MPs) of \u223c140 nm of diameter, \u223c20% of ferrite content, density \u223c1.24 g/cm 3 , were purchased from Spherotech (Sphero\u2122 CM-025-10H), and used as magnetic carriers. The initial concentration of the as received MPs is 1% (w/v). Magneto-plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) of Fe core coated with Au shell (hereafter FeAu-NPs) of \u223c50 nm were purchased from Nanoimmunotech (NITmagold Cit 50 nm). The Fe core is \u223c13 nm of diameter, and the thickness of the Au shell is \u223c38 nm. The surface of the Au-shell is modified with citrate anions.

UV-vis spectra were performed using Evolution 201 Thermo Scientific spectrophotometer."", ""Conjugation of the particles to TB1 and TB2 probes"": ""Generally speaking, the conjugation process consists of five principal steps [32] : 1) washing of the as received particles, 2) surface activation of the particles, 3) coupling (or coating) of the particles with the probes, 4) blocking process to avoid any excess reactive sites, 5) resuspension of the functionalized particles in a suitable storage buffer. All the conjugation protocols used in this work are performed according the technical recommendations in ref [32] ."", ""Polystyrene (PS) magnetic particle (MPs) conjugation"": ""The as received MPs were washed with a 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and magnetically separated. 100 \u03bcM (100 \u03bcmole/L) suspensions of TB1 and TB2 probes were prepared in sterilized H 2 O (Milli-Q). For TB1 coupling to MPs, 200 \u03bcg of MPs were suspended in 180 \u03bcL of the coupling suspension (0.1 M imidazole buffer pH = 7.2, 0.1 M EDAC (N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride)), then 20 \u03bcL of TB1 suspension (100 \u03bcmole/L) was added. The sample was incubated for 16 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. For TB2 coupling to MPs, the same procedure was followed: 200 \u03bcg of MPs were suspended in 180 \u03bcL of the coupling suspension (0.1 M imidazole buffer pH = 7.2, 0.1 M EDAC (N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride)), then 20 \u03bcL of TB2 suspension (100 \u03bcmole/L) was added, and the sample was subject to 16 h incubation at room temperature under gentle shaking. The MPs functionalized with TB1 and TB2 were washed separately and resuspended in 100 mM Tris (tris(hidroximetil)aminometano)buffer to block excess reactive sites. (Reacted at room temperature for 2 h with gentle shaking). Finally the particles were washed and resuspended in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (separately)."", ""Magneto-plasmonic FeAu-NPs conjugation"": ""The as received FeAu-NPs were washed with a 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). For TB1 coupling, 5.024 \u03bcg of FeAu-NPs were suspended in 200 \u03bcL of the coupling suspension (0.1 M imidazole buffer pH = 7.2, 0.1 M EDAC (N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride), then 0.31 \u03bcL of TB1 suspension (100 \u03bcM) was added.

The system consists of a cubical cavity containing a permanent magnetic field with a uniform radial gradient pointing toward the walls of the cubical non-magneticsupport, as shown in Fig. 1 . The magnetic force within the magnetic device is generated by a set of permanent magnets placed in a ring-like distribution following the Halbach progression for a quadrupole [34] . The magnetic device is placed inside the spectrophotometer, and subsequently, a standard polystyrene cuvette containing the MPs suspension (the sample) is introduced into the device in the position as illustrated in Fig. 1-1 . An empty cuvette is used as a reference. Pictures showing the experimental setup are presented in figure S1 of Supporting Information. The assembly generates a constant gradient in the sample volume ( Fig. 1-2 ). The magnetic device presents symmetric apertures for the entrance and exit of the beam light. The light is transmitted in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic force direction. The design of the device allows the insertion of the sample (cuvette) in the working area where the magnetic field is higher than the saturation magnetic field, and thus the MPs become saturated.The transmittance of the initial suspension increases progressively, reaching a transparent final state with all particles close to the wall of the cuvette (Fig. 1-3d) . The transmittance measurements are performed using the UV-vis lamp of the spectrophotometer as a source of light. The light beam passes through the suspension, in a perpendicular direction of the generated magnetic force, and reaches the spectrophotometer detector (Fig. 1) , while the data of the transmittance of the suspension versus time is collected [33] ."", ""Opto-magnetophoretic behavior of the pristine MPs"": ""The as received MPs were washed several times, magnetically separated, and resuspended in H 2 O Milli-Q to form a suspension of 0.001% (w/v). Their magnetic hysteresis loop shows a superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature ( Fig. 1-a) . A volume of 100 \u03bcL of the suspension was introduced into the cuvette to perform the measurement. Prior to magnetophoresis measurements, a standard transmittance spectrum of the suspension (in the range 250-900 nm) was collected ( Fig. 2-b) . The wavelengths 350 nm, 580 nm, and 750 nm were selected to collect the magnetophoresis data. Fig. 2 -c shows the obtained magnetophoresis curves of the suspension. The curves show a similar behavior consisting of a progressive increase of the suspension transmittance. The transmittance increases by 50% respect to the initial state at a time t 50 of 255.04 \u00b1 2.67 s at 350 nm, 239.44 \u00b1 0.86 s at 580 nm, and 236.86 \u00b1 0.98 s at 750 nm. The time t 50 is slightly larger when the data are collected at 350 nm wavelength, which is likely due to the strong absorbance of iron at this wavelength range [35, 36] . In order to obtain the maximum contrast in separation times, all the magnetophoresis measurements presented in this study were collected at 350 nm wavelength. In addition, both MPs and FeAu-NPs are likely to show a strong absorbance around 350 nm wavelength as they both contain iron component.Previous works reported on two different models for magnetophoretic separation kinetics [37] [38] [39] . A fast separation kinetics driven by a reversible aggregation of the MPs, and a slow separation kinetics dominated by a single particle magnetophoretic motion. Within this context, a new theoretical frame work was developed by Andreu et al. [38] for the prediction of the aggregation behavior of MPs, when they are brought under a uniform magnetic field gradient. Briefly, the developed analytical model suggests that the aggregation behavior of colloidal magnetic particles is controlled by a dimensionless parameter N* defined as:where \u03a6 0 is the volume fraction of particles uniformly dispersed in the solution, and \u0393 is the magnetic strength constant defined as:where \u03bc 0 is the free space permeability, m s is the magnetic moment of a particle at saturation magnetization, D is the diameter of the particle, K B is the Boltzmann constant, and T the absolute temperature. Physically, \u0393 is the ratio between the magnetic energy associated to the dipole-dipole attraction, and the thermal energy. The aggregation of magnetic colloids depends on \u0393 and \u03a6 0 through N* [40] . In order to observe long chain formation (aggregation) of magnetic colloids, the condition N* > 10 should be verified. In the case where 1 < N* < 10, small chains are expected to form. If N* < 1, aggregation is not likely to occur, and the separation process is induced by the individual motion of the magnetic colloids, resulting in a slow separation process.In the case of the MPs used for this study, considering the saturation magnetization (\u223c 17 emu/g) Fig. 2 Table S1 of the Supporting Information.Of note, separation times t 50 for both MPs-TB1 and MPs-TB2 suspensions (0.001% w/v) are \u223c30% longer in comparison to the suspension of pristine MPs. This behavior might be attributed to the kinetic and thermodynamic colloidal stabilities acquired by the MPs-TB1 and MPs-TB2. In fact the oligonucleotides are negatively charged due to phosphate \u2212 PO ( ) 2 groups along their backbones, inducing a stability based on electrostatic repulsions particle-particle as illustrated in Fig. 3 d, which is confirmed from zeta-potential measurements as shown in Table 1 . On the other hand, steric stabilization induced by the anchored TB1 and TB2 on the surface of the MPs is likely to contribute to the observed stability of MPs-TB1 and MPs-TB2 suspensions, resulting in an electrosteric colloidal stabilization.In the case of pristine MPs (Fig. 3-d (1) ), the scheme illustrates the mechanism of the formation of particle chains when the suspension is brought under a magnetic force. MPs align to form short chains that move faster in response the magnetic force. when MPs are functionalized with TB1 or TB2 (Fig. 3d-(2) and d-(3) ), the induced repulsive forces between the particles (annotated as \u23af\u2192 \u23af F rep1 and \u23af\u2192 \u23af F rep2 , respectively) disturb the formation of chains of particles, which lead to individual magnetophoretic motion of MPs-TB1 and MPs-TB2, and thus, in an important increment in the magnetic separation times.For the monitoring of TB1 and TB2 hybridization using the optomagnetophoresis method, 50 \u03bcL of MPs-TB1 and 50 \u03bcL of MPs-TB2 suspensions were mixed and incubated at room temperature for different times. In all cases, the working concentrations and volumes were 0.001% (w/v) and 100 \u03bcL, respectively. The suspensions were introduced in the magnetic generator of 7.5 T/m (described in Fig. 1) , which was previously placed inside the spectrophotometer, after the incubation process. The values of the separation times t 50 are shown in table S2 of the supporting information. When MPs-TB1 and MPs-TB2 suspensions (0.001%) are mixed in a ratio 1:1, and as shown in Fig. 4 force, the agglomerates move faster toward the walls of the container, following a cooperative magnetophoretic mode [37] [38] [39] . The velocity of separation of MPs-TB1/MPs-TB2 suspension is higher than the velocity of MPs-TB1 and MPs-TB2, showing differences \u0394t 1 ranging from \u223c37 s to \u223c113 s, depending on the incubation time. However, comparing the separation velocities of pristine MPs and the MPs-TB1/MPs-TB2, the separation times show smaller differences (\u0394t 2 ), observed for incubation times superior to 10 h, as shown in Fig. 4 a. this behavior is expected as both samples follow a cooperative magnetophoretic process, where the magnetic particles form small chain under the magnetic field gradient, and therefore move faster than the individual NPs (See Fig. 4 ) [37] [38] [39] ."", ""Hybridization of FeAu-TB1 and MPs-TB2"": ""FeAu-NPs were functionalized with TB1 and TB2 under the conditions described in the experimental section, and two separate batches of FeAu-NPs functionalized with TB1 (FeAu-TB1) and TB2 (FeAu-TB2) were prepared. UV-vis absorbance spectra corresponding to FeAu-TB1, FeAu-TB2 are shown in Figure S2 of the supporting information. However, the emphasis of our discussion will be on FeAu-TB1 composites (the results are the same for FeAu-TB2). To confirm the successful functionalization of the FeAu-NPs, the changes in the SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance) peak were used. For this purpose, UV-vis spectra of FeAu-TB1 suspension were collected, and the kinetics of the intensity of the SPR peak were monitored during time. The obtained spectra of FeAu-TB1 suspensions are illustrated in figure S3 of Supporting Information. The spectra show a progressive decay of the intensity of the SPR peak around 530 nm indicating the decrease in the concentration of pristine FeAu-NPs in buffer suspension, which suggests the formation of chemical bonds between the FeAu-NPs and the TB1 oligonucleotide. On the other hand, the additional decrease of SPR peak intensity after reacting the functionalized FeAu-TB1 NPs with TB2 (as illustrated in figure S3 ) further confirms the successful functionalization of the NPs, in agreement with previous reports [41, 42] . Fig. 5 -a shows the normalized UV-vis spectra (absorbance) of the MPs-TB2 and FeAu-TB1 suspensions of concentrations of 0.01% (w/v) and 0.02% (w/v), respectively. Fig. 5 -b illustrates the normalized UV-vis spectra of the mixture of both suspensions for different times of incubation. For the preparation of the mixture, 20 \u03bcL of MPs-TB2 suspension was mixed with 80 \u03bcL the suspension of FeAu-TB1. This proportions result in a total volume of 100 \u03bcL containing 0.002% w/v of MPs-TB2 particles and 0.016% w/v of FeAu-TB1 NPs (ratio \u223c 1:8). Three samples of the mixture were prepared and incubated for different times. The resulting UV-vis spectra show a red shift of the SPR peaks of \u223c15 nm and \u223c32 nm when incubation times are increased to 3 h and 20 h, respectively (Fig. 5-b) . A plausible explanation of the observed red shifts, is the spatial proximity between FeAu-TB1 NPs at the occurrence of the hybridization process on the surface of MPs-TB2 particles, as illustrated in the inset in Fig. 5b , providing an efficient optical platform for a strong near-field plasmonic coupling between the FeAu-NPs [3, 42] . The position of the SPR peak corresponding to the sample after 1 h of incubation time doesn't show any shift with respect to the UV-vis spectrum of FeAu-TB1 (Fig. 5-a) , which might be a result of the short incubation time. This is in full agreement with our previous discussion in section 3.2.1., where we pointed-out the nature's role of the different interactions between the functionalized MPs. At the beginning, a balance between the repulsive interactions between FeAu-TB1 NPs and the attractive interactions between FeAu-TB1 and MPs-TB2 would take place, resulting in a small number of FeAu-TB1 NPs attached to the surface of each MP-TB2. After one hour of incubation time, a new balance between the different interactions would be established; the hydrogen bonding between the bases A-T and C-G is likely to become dominant, resulting in an increased number of FeAu-TB1 NPs attached to the surface of each MP-TB2. The spatial proximity of the FeAu-NPs resulting from the increasing number of FeAu-TB1 anchored to the surface of a MP-TB2 leads to a strong near-field plasmonic coupling between the FeAu-NPs, which justifies the SPR peak shift to higher wavelengths, as can be observed in Fig. 5 -b [3, 42] . For magnetophoresis measurements, 100 \u03bcL of the mixture suspension were incubated for 3 h. Fig. 6 -a shows the separation kinetics of the mixture in comparison to the 0.01% suspension of MPs-TB2. The separation time t 50 of MPs-TB2 (\u223c 228 s) is shorter than the t 50 corresponding to FeAu-TB1/MPs-TB2 mixture, indicating that the formed aggregates FeAu-TB1/MPs-TB2 move slower than the MPs-TB2. This behavior will be approached based on the magnetic strength of the formed agglomerates. As discussed in the previous section, during magnetophoresis process, the aggregation of the particles depends strongly on the magnetic strength, \u0393. In the case of FeAu-NPs, based on their physical and chemical properties (saturation magnetization of \u223c5 emu/g, diameter of \u223c50 nm, calculated density of \u223c13.28 g/cm 3 , and the working concentration of \u223c0.016% w/v), the calculated value of \u0393 FeAu-NPs is \u223c0.69 (and N* \u223c 0.01), indicating a non-cooperative magnetophoretic process based on the individual motion of FeAu-NPs [37] [38] [39] , in agreement with the experimental magnetophoresis kinetics obtained for FeAu-NPs, showing separations times > 30 h when the suspension is brought under 7.5 T/m (not shown).Considering the magnetic strength \u0393 for the different systems as follows:\u2022 Magnetic strength of the MPs: \u2022 Magnetic strength of the mixture MPs + FeAu-NPs:Where P is the number of FeAu-NPs bound to each MP. By substituting all the parameters from Eq.s 3,4 and 5 in Eq.6:An approximation of the number P within the experimental conditions of the presented study, was calculated considering a spherical particle of a diameter D 0 = 140 nm, surrounded with a continuous film formed of spherical NPs of a diameter D 1 = 50 nm nm, as illustrated in Fig. 6 -b. The volume of surface-NPs can be estimated as [43] \u03c0 D 4 ( ) agglomerates will move slower than MPs-TB2 while P < 28, and faster for cases where P > 28.These results can be further developed to quantify the exact number of the single hybridizations occurring on the surface of each functionalized MPs. For example, assuming that each FeAu-TB1 NPs is anchored to the surface of the MP-TB2 via a specific number of hybridizations (or points), the number of the anchored FeAu-NPs can be directly associated to the number of the oligonucleotides. Which is highly promising for a quantitative and rapid molecular diagnostic test. Thereby, more quantitative studies combined with theoretical simulations are needed to further advance these findings."", ""Conclusions"": ""We present a simple method for a rapid and accurate detection and separation of twenty-mer oligonucleotides using superparamagnetic and magnetoplasmonic colloidal particles. The method consists of a simultaneous optical and magnetophoretic monitoring of the colloidal suspensions containing the biomolecule to be detected and isolated. For this purpose: i) A magnetic device generating a uniform magnetic field gradient of 7.5 T/m was designed and incorporated into a commercial spectrophotometer. ii) MPs composed of Fe NPs embedded in PS matrix, and magnetoplasmonic NPs composed of Fe core and Au shell, were successfully functionalized with twenty-mer complementary oligonucleotides (named TB1 and TB2). iii) The study demonstrates that incubation time plays an important role in TB1-TB2 hybridization process, and shows that, for concentrations of 0.001% (w/v), 60 min of incubation is the threshold for the hybridization process to occur. iv) Hybridization process results in the formation of agglomerates composed of the magnetic particles and the biomolecules. When brought under the 7.5 T/m magnetic field gradient, those agglomerates follow a cooperative magnetophoretic separation, and move faster than non-hybridized composites. v) The agglomerates composed of hybridized MPs-TB2/FeAu-TB1 separate either faster or slower than the non-hybridized colloids, depending the number of FeAu-NPs bound to each MP. vi) By the use of magnetoplasmonic NPs, the intensity and the shift of the SPR peak are used to track the surface functionalization of the FeAu-NPs, and the formation of the aggregates in the suspension, respectively.Our findings suggest exciting possibilities towards a simple and sensitive method for the detection and isolation of target small biomolecules in complex mixtures. This method is promising for the improvement of conventional latex agglutination tests, used to detect a wide range of analytes in clinical laboratories [33, 44] . In addition, the possibility of recovering the agglomerates at the walls of the container allows their further analysis. In the specific case of agglomerates containing plasmonic nanoparticles, further optical analysis of the sample, such as Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), can be conducted allowing the detection of biomolecules, such as proteins and antigens, at a very low concentrations [3, 45] . This method represents a big step towards a powerful quantitative tool for rapid molecular diagnosis of diseases, and thus contributes to the prevention of societies and economic-systems collapsing, as witnessed with the current coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).Author's contributions MB, SG, and Ll.M conceived the idea.

Developing simple, sensitive, and cost-effective tools that allow the rapid and accurate assembly and isolation of molecular biomarkers has the potential to improve both patient care and hospital logistic efficiency towards personalized and affordable treatments of diseases.In this work, we presenta method consisting ofUV–vis-spectroscopy assisted-magnetophoresis for the monitoring of DNA hybridization. For this purpose, a magnetic device generating 7.5 T/m uniform magnetic field gradient was designed and incorporated to a commercial spectrophotometer. Different batches of colloidal superparamagnetic particles (SMPs), with different elemental compositions, were functionalized with twenty-mer complementary oligonucleotides, TB1 and TB2. When the functionalized SMPs-TB1 and SMPs-TB2 are mixed and incubated, the hybridization process of TB1 and TB2 occurs resulting in the formation of colloidal aggregates. When brought under the magnetic field, depending on the magnetic strength (Γ) of the formed aggregates, they separate either faster or slower than the non-functionalized SMPs. The difference in magnetic separation time (Δt) is optically monitored by measuring the real time transparency of the suspension at specific wavelengths. The detection of aggregates at concentrations of 0.001% w/v was achieved, showing [Formula: see text] ranging from 113−228 s. Based on the changes of Δt, the study addresses how electrosteric, magnetic, and hydrogen bonding interactions affect the hybridization process and suggests optimum experimental conditions for accurate monitoring of TB1-TB2 hybridization.",10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.111126,Elsevier; Medline; PMC,PMC7228730,32422560.0,no-cc,2020-05-15,Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,,,,218643751.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.111126; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0927776520303568; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927776520303568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422560/,2020.0,paper

Seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were listed for countries to react to, and act on. Law is specifically addressed in SDG 16 1 (peace, justice and strong institutions), but it is clear that the other SDGs cannot be attained if the use and misuse of law are not addressed. In this article, we examine what law, international human rights law, can do for the health-related SDGs. We will strengthen the case of the World Health Organization (WHO) to put health at the centre of the SDGs, as health is a human right, and we will look at legal measures to ensure health for all. We also discuss the role of the law in addressing seven emerging health challenges.The first recorded declaration of early human rights dates from 539 BC. The Cyrus Cylinder, 2 a clay tablet, mentions the right to freedom from slavery and freedom of religion. Human rights have since developed and are now an intrinsic part of the legal structures of most societies. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) 3 was established following the atrocities of World War II and is a comprehensive international affirmation of the rights to which everyone is entitled, including the right to health.What exactly is meant by 'the right to health'? The 1946 Constitution of the World Health Organization notes that 'Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity'. The UDHR states 'Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services. . .' [Article 25 (1) ]. The right to health is thus closely related to and dependent upon the realization of other human rights, including the rights to food, housing, work, freedoms of association, assembly and movement and access health services.There is no 'right to be healthy'-instead the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural rights (ICESCR) refers in Article 12 to 'the right of everyone to the highest attainable standard of health'. 4 The focus is thus on the conditions necessary for good health. These conditions are noted in multiple United Nations and regional human rights treaties. For example, housing is noted in the UDHR, the ICESCR and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Safe and potable water is only listed in the ICESCR. Each treaty has an expert committee tasked with issuing authoritative interpretations, receiving complaints and monitoring States' implementation of the rights in its respective treaty. Understandably, States sometimes have different interpretations of their obligations and demonstrate varying levels of commitment and implementation.All 17 SDGs can be seen to impact on human health; however, some SDGs are directly health related. In 2019, WHO-together with 10 other international organizations-launched the Global Action Plan for Healthy Living and Well-being for All (the Plan), putting 'the health goal (SDG 3) right at the centre of the entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development'. 5 The Plan 'represents a historic commitment to advance collective action and accelerate progress towards the SDGs'. The European Public Health Association has also put the right to health at the forefront with a study in April 2018 tracking Europe's progress towards the health-related SDGs, listing these as the 'Sustainable Health Goals'. 6 In an updated study (reference to Article no 2 in this supplement), four health issues are in need of Europe's urgent attention: smoking, harmful use of alcohol, suicide mortality and childhood obesity.The role of law in ensuring health for all and leaving no one behind Law can be used in many ways to safeguard population health and safety. Under international human rights law, countries have obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the right to health. This means that laws should not breach human rights, e.g. by instituting discrimination in access to national health services. Laws should also protect people from discrimination by third parties, e.g. the private sector, in accessing services. Finally, national laws should further countries' international legal obligations to progressively realize the right to health, e.g. by ensuring the conditions in which people can be healthy, such as improved access to water, sanitation, housing and education. Law can also be used to regulate the environment (e.g. through air and noise pollution measures), tax unhealthy products (e.g. through fat, sugar, soda and tobacco taxes) and limit the marketing and accessibility of unhealthy products (e.g. through minimum age requirement for alcohol purchase).Law is especially important to provide practical detail and accountability and to establish the mandate for universal health coverage (UHC). 7 Admittedly, tensions can arise between public health regulations and individual freedoms, 8 when perceived over-regulation is sometimes referred to as the 'Nanny State'. Nonetheless, legislation is key in fundamental questions around governance, structures and functions for operationalising the SDGs."", ""Twenty-first century health challenges that law needs to address"": ""Law must adapt to address the health challenges of the 21st century. 10 Below, we discuss seven emerging health challenges:(1) technology and digitalization, (2) deteriorating quality of life in ageing populations, (3) climate change, (4) resurgence of infectious diseases, (5) ensuring health services for hard-to-reach and vulnerable populations, (6) commercial determinants of health, and (7) threats to civil space."", ""Technology and digitalization"": ""The speed of developing new technology and digitalization has an increasing health impact. In this section, we will focus on protection of private data and the use of genomic information for health.In recent years, Europe has stepped up the protection of personal data. The 2018 General Data Protection Regulation 11 aims to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe and reshape the way data is being managed. Informed consent is necessary for the use of personal data, and the right to privacy of every European citizen is hereby further strengthened. In the era of technological developments, the right to privacy is of the utmost importance.At the same time, however, demographic research is moving towards big data, combining data from different sources to improve health analyses and thereby strengthening health interventions and planning. There is an ongoing discussion about whether informed consent to use anonymized data for a specific study also means that consent can be assumed for the use of those anonymous data for other studies (so-called 'secondary use of data'), or whether specific consent is again necessary.In 2015, European Public Health Association joined other nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to call for an appropriate balance that protects the interests of individuals while enabling research that benefits us all. 12 The role of law is to create a framework to balance the right to privacy with the need for big data research (in health).Genetic mapping is quickly developing to assist in health promotion (if you have a risk factor) and treatment (precision medicine). There is, however, a great risk that this information may lead to discrimination against individuals and population groups. For instance, Pik\u00f3 et al. 13 have reported that the Roma population has increased genetic susceptibility to venous thrombosis. Targeted interventions for Roma can be taken to consider this increased susceptibility. However, there is an increased risk of genetic discrimination, for instance by excluding venous thrombosis in health insurance for Roma.Law should therefore regulate the use of genetic mapping and should be specifically vigilant to prevent misuse of this tool."", ""Deteriorating quality of life in ageing populations"": ""The right to life is protected in the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 2. 14 At the same time, the population in Europe is ageing-the average life expectancy is now 78 years. But if the increased life expectancy and the new technologies in treatment lead to the population getting older and older, should not the quality of life prevail? In other words, should the right to life include the right to die in dignity? The legal and ethical considerations of voluntary euthanasia and related advance directives should not be underestimated. Law should be vigilant to address this issue, taking into account ethical procedures and protecting against the misuse of euthanasia."", ""Climate change"": ""The changing climate will have enormous consequences for the health of all people. Climate change must be considered in all actions to promote health. Increases in temperature will lead to increased risk of heatstroke and more tropical diseases in Europe. In 2017, the European Centre for Disease Control reported cases of malaria which were not travel-related but acquired in Europe 15 and-with the rise in temperature-there is a risk of a further increase. Climate change will also have an impact on air pollution and emergency preparedness (e.g. flooding) and will also lead to economic migration in Europe.Law should be used to both mitigate climate change (through regulating industry and other sources of greenhouse gases) and to (2) Although law has been central to major public health achievements in the past, its capacity to advance global health with justice remains substantially underutilized, particularly among professionals in the fields of health and science.(3) The right to health, a legally binding norm, provides a foundation for advance global health with justice and should underpin health-related legal reforms. (4) Every human being has a right to affordable, high-quality health services. By embedding equity and accountability in all health systems, the law and the rule of law can achieve health coverage that is truly universal-delivering the SDGs' promise to leave no one behind. (5) Although the ability to enforce compliance with international legal obligations is generally limited and largely dependent on power dynamics and political will, creative mechanisms can foster compliance and help establish impetus for action. (6) Law can address the pressing health concerns of the 21st century, across diverse areas. From tobacco control, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and road safety to health emergencies, law can implement fair, evidence-based interventions and build the research case for legal action. (7) Laws that stigmatize or discriminate against marginalized populations are especially harmful and exacerbate health disparities. The global health community must oppose laws that undermine the right to health and to equity. (8) To realize the full potential of law to advance global health with justice, the global health community should build legal capacity and establish a sustained dialogue with legislators, regulators, judges, civil society and researchers. 9 ensure timely and adequate adaptation measures to protect the health of the people and of the planet."", ""Resurgence of infectious diseases"": ""In Europe, we have seen a spectacular reduction in measles and rubella, due to childhood vaccination schemes (legal or voluntary). However, since 2017, there has been a resurgence of measles in Europe and it seems that policymakers are more influenced by fake news and anti-vax movements than by evidence. For instance, the Lorenzin law in Italy on compulsory vaccinations for children to be allowed in school, met with great controversy, 16 but-even with a change in government-is still in place, as it protects children and whole communities against illness.Ensuring health services for disadvantaged and vulnerable populations UHC implies that everyone is able to access quality health services without experiencing financial hardship, but UHC is difficult to implement and maintain, especially in a time of budget cuts. This means that disadvantaged populations may refrain from seeking the health care they need, creating greater national health inequalities. Vulnerable communities such as migrants have even more difficulties accessing health services that accommodate language barriers and cultural differences. Finally, rural areas may face problems accessing services. The law should ensure putting a priority on financing health services and making sure that discrimination in access on any grounds is addressed."", ""Commercial determinants of health"": ""Major NCDs in Europe include heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung disease. The rise of these NCDs has been driven by primarily four major risk factors: tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol and unhealthy diets, all linked to commercial activities of the corporate sector (the so-called 'commercial determinants of health'). 17 Addressing these determinants requires looking at producers, marketers and other commercial actors-rather than the individual 'risk takers'-and formulating appropriate measures to limit commercial activities. 18 For example, SDG target 3.4 is to 'reduce by one-third premature mortality from NCDs. . .' In the tobacco context, the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World describes itself as 'an independent, non-profit organization committed to reducing deaths and diseases caused by smoking' and is funded by Philip Morris International. 19 However the Foundation is not focused on stopping tobacco use-this raises broader questions about the regulation of ecigarettes and other tobacco products."", ""Threats to civil space"": ""The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which monitors the implementation of the ICESCR, has noted (para. 54):The formulation and implementation of national health strategies and plans of action should respect, inter alia, the principles of non-discrimination and people's participation. In particular, the right of individuals and groups to participate in decision-making processes, which may affect their development, must be an integral component of any policy, programme or strategy developed to discharge governmental obligations under article 12. . .[of the ICESCR]. 4It is well recognized that civil and political rights are part of the social determinants of health. 20 Less well understood however is that freedoms of speech and association, guaranteed by national laws and an independent judiciary, are essential to the full achievement of the right to health. Civil society must be free to publicly challenge government action or inaction on health matters. In its watchdog role, civil society also provides a check on government inefficiency, negligence or corruption in responding to national health challenges. A free press and, today, uncensored social media, are equally vital. The rapid spread of HIV in China was in part attributed to the authorities' censorship of early reports of unregulated blood selling. 21, 22 The experience was repeated with the SARS epidemic in 2002-2003, 23, 24 and more recently African swine fever 25 and COVID-19 26 ."", ""Conclusion"": ""As Gostin et al. state: 'Law can be a powerful tool for advancing global health, yet it remains substantially underutilized and poorly understood'. 9 Especially when talking about the SDGs, law has an important role to play in the field of health for all. Law is an essential tool to set a framework that allows governments and health professionals to do all they can to achieve health for all. This includes but is not limited to: protecting the rights of individuals especially the right not to face discrimination in accessing health services, assessing old and new tools to promote the public's health and monitoring government action to make sure that no one is left behind.It is therefore essential that health professionals and lawyers work together, understand each other and appreciate each other's competencies. Together with an outspoken NGO community highlighting both the gaps and emerging health issues, lawyers and health professionals can together advocate for action on the health-related SDGS, making sure that no one is left behind.Conflicts of interest: None declared.""}",The essential role of law in achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals,"In this article, we examine the essential role of law in achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

India, a country with over 1.3 billion people across metropolitan areas and rural villages and an underdeveloped medical infrastructure 1 , could be particularly hard hit with the unmitigated spread of COVID-19 2 . To address this challenge, India has implemented widespread lockdown measures, including social distancing and travel restrictions 3, 4 . On March 24, India first announced nationwide lockdown for three weeks, effectively home quarantining everyone in the country to curb the pandemic growth. The lockdown in India was subsequently extended three times, first to May 3, then to May 17, and currently to May 31 5 . Evidence from both India and abroad demonstrates that social distancing is essential to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and reduce mortality 1,6-10 , especially until a vaccine is developed. Nevertheless, several countries, including India, are now cautiously beginning to lift some restrictions in hopes of restarting the economy and preventing economic distress.The government of India has categorized districts of India into three zones based on the COVID-19 risks. The hotspots of transmission, categorized as \""red zones,\"" are identified based on total active cases, doubling rate of confirmed cases, extent of testing, and district feedback.Areas with declining or stable numbers of cases are classified as \""orange zones\"" and areas with no reported cases for a significant number of days are classified as \""green zones\"" 11, 12 . While nationwide lockdown continues until May 31, considerable relaxations for economic and public service activities are now being allowed in lower-risk districts marked as green and orange zones. During the first phase of reopening of the country-starting June 1-intra-state and inter-state travel will gradually be allowed without need of prior permission from the government. Similarly, places of worship, hotels, restaurants, malls and other hospitality services would resume operation from June 8 13 . As restrictions are eased within specific zones, attention should be directed to geographic hot spots that may disproportionately exacerbate the spread of COVID-19 14 .Red light areas (RLAs), where thousands of sex workers typically live and work 15 , are one area of concern for rapid transmission of COVID-19. By design, these areas have high contact rates between sex workers and clients, and sex acts are not amenable to social distancing.Sex workers are vulnerable to high rates of infectious diseases 16, 17 , experiencing particularly high rates of asymptomatic transmission of infections-a notable component of COVID-19 epidemiology. Moreover, visitors to RLAs include many truck drivers and migrant workers 18 , who not only live locally but travel long-distances and can potentially spread the virus more broadly, including to green and orange zones. The combined features of a high volume of visitors, high contact rates, potential higher infectivity of sex workers, and long-distance travel of clients across India may make the reopening of RLAs a risk to increasing COVID-19 transmission, health care utilization, and death. Therefore, the impact of COVID-19 within RLAs, on the cities in which they reside, and on the Indian populace requires critical evaluation.An analysis in Japan has demonstrated a surge of COVID-19 cases transmitted in RLAs-cases that have overwhelmed local hospitals 19 . Considering the high risk of COVID-19 transmission, other countries, such as the Netherlands 20 , Germany 21 , and Australia 22 , have identified brothels as the last enterprises to reopen. In Australia, brothels and strip clubs are the only businesses to be designated as indefinitely closed.Prior studies have evaluated the benefits of lockdown in India for slowing COVID-19 transmission 1,23,24 . However, no previous analysis has examined the effect that the reopening of RLAs would have on the spread of COVID-19 in India, or whether keeping them closed would lead to a reduction of cases, reduced health care utilization, and improved mortality rates. Such an analysis would be helpful to the national and local governments to make targeted decisions about when, where, and how to ease lockdown measures in the best interest of public health, the health care system, and the economy.To understand the potential impact of extended closure of RLAs on COVID-19 in India, we developed a model that quantifies the effects of re-opening RLAs after the end of the lockdown.We estimated the change in the time to reach peak COVID-19 cases: the change in cases, hospitalization rates, and mortality rates; and the spread of COVID-19 within RLAs at both the national level and among some of the largest cities in India that have been designated within the red zones 11 ."", ""Study population"": ""Data collected on RLAs ( Table 1 ) facilitated model parameterization. Closure of RLAs after lockdown significantly delayed the spread of COVID-19 in all cities and nationally, including reduced numbers of cases and deaths ( Fig. 2-3 ). The magnitude of these effects varied with greater infectiousness (increasing R 0 ; Appendix Tables 3-4 ) and increased with a greater resident population of RLAs relative to the general population of the city and with a greater contact rate between the general population of the city and residents of the RLA ( Fig. 3 ; Table 1 )."", ""Delay of the peak of cases"": ""The initial nationwide lockdown is projected to substantially delay the peak of the epidemic for each city considered and India ( Fig. 2, Appendix Table 3 ). Extended closure of RLA after the lockdown is lifted can further delay the epidemic peak further by at least 8 days and up to 23 days with an R 0 of 1.75-2.25 in India ( Appendix Table 3 ) . There was variation between peak delays among cities. The smallest delay in the peak of cases with an extended closure of the RLA in Mumbai was a 9-day delay using R 0 = 2.25 (a 114-day delay to a 123-day delay; Appendix Table 3 ). The largest delay in the peak of cases with an extended closure of the RLA in Kolkata was 117 days-close to the delay that was produced by lockdown alone-using R 0 = 1.75 (a 126-day delay to a 243-day delay; Appendix Table 3 )."", ""Reduction in cases and deaths"": ""We found that an extended closure of RLAs after the initial lockdown period would avert 32% to 60.2% of cumulative cases and 43% to 67.6% of cumulative deaths across India when compared at the date of the peak of epidemic under re-opening of RLAs ( Fig. 3 , Appendix Table 4 ). Among cities, these reductions of COVID-19 cases and deaths were at least 49.7% and 59.2% respectively for R 0 = 2 ( Fig. 3 ). In Kolkata, Pune, and Nagpur, reductions in cumulative cases and deaths at the date of this peak were more than 90% for all R 0 considered ( Appendix Table 4 )."", ""Cases, hospitalization, and mortality within RLAs"": ""Extended closure of RLAs after the initial lockdown reduced cases, hospitalizations, and mortality within RLAs in accordance with potential R 0 values for COVID-19. With re-opening of the RLAs, 32.5% (207,408) to 44.9% (285,908) of all RLA residents were projected to be infected by COVID-19 by the peak of the epidemic in India ( Appendix Table 5 ). By the same date under a scenario of extended closure of the RLA, the proportion of RLA residents infected would be between 12.9% to 30.5%. For R 0 = 2, the maximum reduction in cumulative cases at the peak of epidemic occurs within the RLA of Kolkata (from 8,436 cases to 42 cases; Appendix Table 5 ) and the minimum reduction occurs within RLA of Mumbai (from 2195 cases to 1104 cases; Appendix Table 5 ). "", ""Burden on hospital capacity"": ""India has approximately 1.9 million hospital beds, 95 thousand ICU beds, and 48 thousand ventilators. Most of the beds and ventilators in India are concentrated in seven states-Uttar Pradesh (14.8%), Karnataka (13.8%), Maharashtra (12.2%), Tamil Nadu (8.1%), West Bengal (5.9%), Telangana (5.2%), and Kerala (5.2%) 25 . As a result of extended closure of RLAs after the initial lockdown, current hospital capacity would be reached on October 26 rather than October 15 2020 (Fig. 5) . Moreover, at the projected November 19 peak of cases, India would need 10 times more hospital capacity than current capacity, while under extended closure of RLAs, required hospital capacity would be 5.8 times higher ( Fig. 5 ) .Indian central and state governments are adding additional beds on a daily basis to ramp-up the healthcare capacity. Under the scenario in which closure of RLAs is not extended, the high number of imminent cases and consequent demand for hospitalization/ICU admission and ventilator use rates will likely surpass India's peak medical resource capacity, especially in the vulnerable zones-leading to a higher mortality rate (Fig. 5 )."", ""Discussion"": ""Our study demonstrates a beneficial impact of extended closure of RLAs in India compared with their re-opening on COVID-19 cases, hospitalization and mortality. Extended closure would delay the peak number of cases by 8-23 days and result in a 32.0-60.2% reduction in the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases nationally, when compared at the date of the epidemic peak under a scenario of re-opening the RLAs. There would also be a 43-67.6% reduction in the cumulative number of COVID-19-related deaths nationally. These benefits of extended closure of RLAs, including a delayed peak in cases, a reduced increase in cases, and a reduction in deaths were demonstrated in Mumbai, New Delhi, Pune, Nagpur, and Kolkata, as well as across India. Mumbai and Kolkata (at the two extremes of R 0 considered) produced the most disparate results across cities-a difference that can be attributed to the size of the resident populations of the RLAs relative to the general population of the city and to the contact rates between the general population of the city and residents of the RLA.The lockdown, contact tracing, and other post-lockdown government interventions 26, 27 can continue to suppress transmission and flatten the curve, but it is unlikely for the pandemic to be resolved until there is a vaccine for the population 28 . Vaccine development and widespread distribution throughout India may take at least 18 more months 29 . In the absence of efficacious treatments or vaccines for COVID-19, there are limited public health interventions that can substantially reduce COVID-19 cases and deaths when re-opening a country as large and diverse as India 30, 31 . Extended closure of RLAs in India may be one of these interventions-and it is feasible. Given the disproportionate impact of RLAs on COVID-19 transmission and the increase of mortality associated with its spread, extension of closure is essential to the protection of sex workers; their clients; the people who interact closely with sex workers and those close to RLAs, including local businesses, police personnel, NGO workers, and the local community; and the population of India at large. In addition to the lower immediate cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, extended closure confers additional time for the nation to plan and execute measures to protect public health and the economy, and to exchange public health and medical advances with the rest of the world. Similar to decisions to close cinema halls, gyms, and large public gatherings, RLAs should be critically evaluated for their ongoing potential to accelerate COVID-19 transmission and spread.The outcomes of our model are supported by the experiences of other countries with COVID-19 and RLAs. In Japan, for example, medical facilities were overwhelmed by a surge of cases linked to an RLA 19, 32, 33 . The sharp increase in cases manifested among sex workers and their clients, and was largely contained within that sector only because of targeted and robust public health interventions. Japanese medical institutes have placed sex workers in the highest risk category for contracting the virus-the only profession in that classification not related to the medical field 34 . In Germany and Australia, brothels remain indefinitely closed, with some politicians calling for their permanent closure in Germany 35 . Due to concern regarding COVID-19 transmission, sole-operator sex workers and strip clubs have also been banned in Australia 21, 22 . The diversity of businesses that function to enable commercial sex work or other activities involving close physical proximity as part of the nature of service share many of the same risk factors as the sex workers. These other businesses include strip clubs, ladies' bars, hotels that also commerce in sexual services, private sex-work establishments, spas, and massage parlors.There are many social, economic, and health challenges, alongside the spread of COVID-19, that sex workers and their families will face under extended closure. Residents of RLAs typically live in confined, communal living spaces. Without sex work, they have very limited access to food and other vital living supplies. Furthermore, many sex workers lack government-approved documentation and thus are unable to benefit from the government's financial relief packages 36, 37 Table 2 ). Individuals Table 2 ). The probability of infection given a contact between a client from the general population and a resident of an RLA was assumed to be one, if the resident was a sex-worker, and , if the resident was a non-sex worker. As non-sex workers account for five times more interactions with clients than sex-workers, we calculated the probability of infection given a contact between a client from the general population and any resident of the red-light area as the weighted average of these two probabilities,"", ""Thus,"": ""The interactions between the general population and the RLA occurring via clients were defined by the connectivity matrix where is the contact rate between the two communities. This contact rate was calculated as the per-capita daily clients from the general population who visit the red-light area.We used social contact matrices estimated for India overall and within specific locations such as households 41 to construct contact patterns between age-groups based on whether individuals are quarantined in their home or not. The contact patterns between age-groups were captured by two matrices: ( Table 1) to the average number of interactions in the contact matrix .We specified that individuals with asymptomatic and mild infections are only 50% infectious compared to severe infections ( Appendix Table 2 )."", ""Model fitting"": ""To generate epidemic projections, we first estimated the initial prevalence of COVID-19 at Table 2 ) using the least-squares method. Using our calibrated model, we generated results under scenarios of no initial lockdown, initial lockdown followed by return to status quo, and initial lockdown followed by extended closure of the RLA."", ""Implementation of initial lockdown"": ""To implement the 68-day national lockdown in our model, we specified that everyone remained at home, and their contact patterns were informed by the household matrix for the duration of lockdown. Moreover, we set the interaction rate between the general population and the RLA at zero during this period."", ""Post-lockdown"": ""After the initial lockdown period, contact patterns were informed by the overall contact matrix , and it was assumed that as a result of improved contact-tracing capacity achieved during lockdown, 50% of symptomatic cases were isolated after the lockdown period 10 . For the scenario of extended closure of the RLA after lockdown, we maintained the contact rate ;with no extended closure, it returned to its original value."", ""Range of R 0 Values"": ""The basic reproduction number, R 0 , is the expected number of cases directly generated by an infected person in a completely susceptible population early in an epidemic, without public health intervention. For example, if early in an outbreak, a single individual typically develops the infection and passes it to 2 people, the R 0 is 2. If R 0 > 1, there will be an exponential spread of the infection. If R 0 < 1, the rate of infection spread will be lower and eventually stop.Epidemics grow faster with higher R 0 . In this study, we show a range of results based on R 0 values of 1.75 to 2.25 calculated in recent research on the COVID-19 pandemic 10, 44, 45 ."", ""Data collection"": ""To obtain current estimates of city-level population data, we applied population growth rate For national-level data, the number of sex workers, brothels, and client visits was determined from secondary sources 51, 52 . Exhaustive face validation with subject experts was conducted for the dynamic data sets pertaining to the movement of sex / non-sex workers, clients, and their interaction within the brothels due to the high volatility of movement patterns of primary respondents at any given time-space in RLAs. Where more general secondary sources exhibited discrepancies with the specific RLA surveys, the more specific estimates from the five RLA surveys were used to compose final data at the national level."", ""Data Availability"": ""References for all the data used in the analysis are provided in the article and supplementary material.

""}",The effect of extended closure of red-light areas on COVID-19 transmission in India,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in over 200,000 cases in India. Thus far, India has implemented lockdown measures to curb disease transmission. However, commercial sex work in red-light areas (RLAs) has potential to lead to COVID-19 resurgence after lockdown. We developed a model of COVID-19 transmission in RLAs, evaluating the impact of extended RLA closure compared with RLA reopening on cases, hospitalizations, and mortality rates within the RLAs of five major Indian cities, within the cities, and across India. Closure lowered transmission at all scales. More than 90% of cumulative cases and deaths among RLA residents of Kolkata, Pune, and Nagpur could be averted by the time the epidemic would peak under a re-opening scenario. Across India, extended closure of RLAs would benefit the population at large, delaying the peak of COVID-19 cases by 8 to 23 days, and avert 32% to 60.2% of cumulative cases and 43% to 67.6% of cumulative deaths at the peak of the epidemic. Extended closure of RLAs until better prevention and treatment strategies are developed would benefit public health in India.",,ArXiv,,,arxiv,2020-06-12,,,,2006.10488,219792551.0,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10488v1.pdf,2020.0,paper

These changes lead to an increase in basal oxygen consumption. The majority of women are more aware of their breathing, which may lead to the common complaint of shortness of breath. This is most common in the third trimester and may lead to diagnostic confusion. In late pregnancy, the diaphragmatic elevation caused by the enlarging uterus leads to a decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC), but diaphragm excursion is unaffected so vital capacity is unchanged. Pregnancy-induced physiological changes that occur in the respiratory system are summarized in Table 1 ."", ""Asthma"": ""Asthma is the most common preexisting medical disorder encountered in pregnancy, and its prevalence in women of childbearing age is increasing. The biggest danger to the mother and her fetus comes from poorly controlled or undertreated disease. Management during pregnancy should include education regarding inhaler use and reassurance about the safety of medications used to control asthma."", ""The effect of pregnancy on asthma"": ""The natural history of asthma in pregnancy is very variable. Literature addressing the effect of pregnancy on asthma is conflicting, with no consistent trend to improvement or worsening of disease severity. Some North American studies suggest that between one in five and one in nine women with asthma will have at least one admission to the emergency department, and of these, 62% will require hospitalization. The course of asthma in pregnancy in an individual woman is largely unpredictable. Women commencing pregnancy with severe or poorly controlled disease will experience worsening of symptoms, particularly in the third trimester, compared with those with mild disease. There is some evidence that the course of the disease is similar in successive pregnancies. Many asthmatics experience worsening of their symptoms during pregnancy because they stop or reduce medication due to fears (either their own or their medical advisers') about its safety. The current UK guidelines recommend prepregnancy counselling to women with asthma regarding the importance and safety of continuing their asthma medication during pregnancy to ensure good control.The effect of asthma on pregnancy During pregnancy, there is an increased incidence of complications, both maternal and fetal. These complications, often serious, happen nearly exclusively in patients with severe and/or poorly controlled asthma. In a recent study, the most common maternal complications were meconium-stained amniotic fluid, preterm labour or delivery, oligohydramnios and pregnancy-induced hypertension. There was some evidence of a modest association between maternal asthma and risk of preterm premature rupture of membranes.The most common neonatal complications were meconium staining, preterm infant and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Women who required systemic steroids were more likely to have oligohydramnios, IUGR, meconium staining or pregnancy-induced hypertension.Pregnancy should be seen as an opportunity to optimize asthma control to prevent acute deterioration."", ""Management of asthma in pregnancy"": ""The successful management of asthma during pregnancy requires a co-operative multidisciplinary approach between obstetricians and midwives, the physician and nurse specialists managing the asthma, and the woman herself. It includes: objective assessment of pulmonary function and fetal well being (home peak flow monitoring and personalized self-management plans are successful in the well-motivated pregnant asthmatic), avoidance of asthma triggers, pharmacological therapy and patient education.Drug treatment of asthma in pregnancy is similar to treatment in non-pregnant women. All the drugs commonly used to treat asthma, including shortand long-acting b2 agonists, inhaled corticosteroids and methyl xanthines, are safe in pregnancy. Fluticasone may be used for those requiring high doses of inhaled steroids."", ""Oral corticosteroids"": ""As systemic corticosteroids have serious and wellknown side-effects when given frequently or in high doses for prolonged periods, women and their doctors are reluctant to use steroids in pregnancy. Most of this concern is misplaced, and steroids should be used to treat asthma in pregnancy in the same way and for the same reasons as in the nonpregnant state. About 90% of prednisolone is metabolized by the placenta and therefore only small quantities of the active drug reach the fetus. Several studies suggest no increased risk of abortion, stillbirth, congenital malformations, adverse fetal effects or neonatal death attributable to treating the mother with steroids. The maternal adverse effects from steroid therapy in pregnancy include increased risk of infections, reduced glucose tolerance and increased gestational diabetes. The development of hyperglycaemia (treatable with insulin) is not an indication to discontinue or decrease the dose of oral steroids, the requirement for which must be determined by the asthma. The rare, but important, psychiatric side-effects of oral glucocorticoids (with prednisolone X30 mg) should be remembered, and all women who have been commenced on steroids should be reviewed within 1 week. "", ""Leukotriene receptor antagonists"": ""Data regarding the safety of leukotriene receptor antagonists in pregnancy are extremely limited. These agents should not be commenced in a pregnant asthmatic. They may, however, be continued in women achieving asthma control that is not achieved with any other medications."", ""Management of acute asthma attack"": ""There is evidence that pregnant women presenting with an acute asthmatic attack are less likely than their non-pregnant counterparts to receive appropriate treatment with steroids. Hence, they are more likely to experience ongoing exacerbations. In the last two Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths in the UK (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) , there were eight indirect maternal deaths from asthma. Drug therapy should be given as for a non-pregnant patient with asthma, including repeat doses of inhaled b2 agonists and early administration of oral steroids. The treatment aim is to maintain the partial pressure of oxygen greater than 60 mmHg and oxygen saturation above 95%. In severe cases, intravenous treatment with magnesium sulphate, b2 agonists or aminophylline can be used as indicated. Continuous fetal assessment should be performed when asthma is uncontrolled or severe, or when the initial assessment is non-reassuring. Acute severe asthma in pregnancy should be considered as an emergency and should be treated vigorously in hospital. Provided abdominal shielding is used, a chest X-ray results in minimal exposure of the fetus to ionizing radiation, and if clinically indicated, this investigation must never be withheld just because the patient is pregnant.For women with poor control in pregnancy, there should be good liaison between the respiratory physician and the obstetrician."", ""Management of asthma during labour and delivery"": ""Acute attacks of asthma during labour and delivery are extremely rare, and women should be reassured accordingly. Regularly scheduled medications should be continued during labour. Those on oral steroids (47.5 mg prednisolone) more than 2 weeks preceding labour should receive parenteral steroids (hydrocortisone 100 mg 6-8 hourly) during labour and until they are able to restart their oral medication. Prostaglandin E2, used to induce labour, is a bronchodilator and is safe. Prostaglandin F2a, indicated for severe postpartum haemor-rhage, should be used with extreme caution as it may cause bronchospasm.Women with asthma may safely use all forms of pain relief in labour, including epidural analgesia and Entonox. Non-histamine-releasing narcotics, such as fentanyl, are preferred to the other opiates. If anaesthesia is required, women should be encouraged to have an epidural rather than general anaesthesia because of the increased risk of severe bronchospasm, chest infection and associated atelectasis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used for pain relief following caesarean section. Women with asthma should be asked about any known aspirin or NSAID sensitivity prior to the use of these drugs."", ""Breastfeeding"": ""Women with asthma should be encouraged to breastfeed. The risk of atopic disease developing in the child of an asthmatic woman is about one in 10, or one in three if both parents are atopic. Breastfeeding may reduce this risk. All inhaled preparations, oral steroids and methylxanthines are safe when breastfeeding."", ""Cystic fibrosis"": ""Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal-recessive disorder arising from a defect on chromosome 7 in the region coding for the CF transmembrane regulator protein. Abnormal quantity or function of this protein results in disturbed ion and water transport across cells of many glands. This is responsible for excessively thick secretions that can cause obstruction, organ damage and loss of function. The carrier frequency is 1:25 in Caucasians, with an estimated prevalence of one in 2500 livebirths.The clinical picture is dominated by early persistent and recurrent respiratory infection despite attempts at prevention and aggressive treatment. However, chronic infection with progressive lung damage is inevitable, leading to respiratory failure. The other feature is pancreatic insufficiency from obstruction, which necessitates lifelong supplementation with pancreatic enzymes. Malabsorption and poor growth are common. Other problems include biliary cirrhosis from obstruction to biliary ductules, pancreatic endocrine dysfunction leading to glucose intolerance and CF-related diabetes, and osteoporosis. With the development of specialized centres and various other interventions, the median survival has steadily increased from early teens in the 1960s to the fourth decade and beyond at present. The feasibility of lung transplantation has helped improve survival. Although fertility is uniformly affected in male CF sufferers, it is relatively unaffected in females."", ""Effect of CF on pregnancy"": ""Many hundreds of CF pregnancies have now been reported. A Scandinavian study reporting on 80 pregnancies in 162 women with CF found that 46 (75%) of 61 women considering pregnancy could achieve it, although assisted reproduction was required in 15%. A large proportion of those who achieved pregnancy continued it, with 10% choosing termination of pregnancy as an option. This indicates that these women were highly motivated.Healthy women with CF can have successful pregnancies without detriment to their condition. This hitherto meant women without pancreatic insufficiency. However, with enzyme supplementation and proper diet management, increasing numbers of women with pancreatic insufficiency are entering pregnancy in a relatively 'healthy' state. To achieve adequate weight gain in pregnancy, many will require oral, nasogastric, gastrostomy or parenteral supplementation. Rates of preterm birth are high, particularly with low maternal weights, but perinatal mortality is surprisingly low. Sometimes preterm delivery may be medically indicated in unwell women. Therapeutic termination of pregnancy may be required in very sick women, underscoring the need for effective contraception in those not wishing to get pregnant. Should the condition be complicated by CF-related diabetes, the pregnancy outcome is adversely affected. Although the outcome is consistently improving with time, it still remains inferior compared with those without CF-related diabetes. Pregnancy in lung transplant recipients with CF has been reported. Although the data are relatively limited, they seem to agree with the experience with other organ transplants. Rejection of the transplant is more common in the first 2 years, so pregnancy should ideally not be embarked upon during this time. A pregnancy undertaken more than 2 years after transplant is expected to be associated with little risk of transplant rejection, organ failure or fetal anomalies.Severely deranged liver function constitutes a contra-indication to pregnancy. However, mild elevation of liver enzymes and/or abnormal liver ultrasound scans are relatively common, and do not have a major impact on the outcome. Pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure are the other contra-indications to pregnancy in women with CF.CF is an autosomally transmitted disease, and genetic counselling should be offered to those women with CF considering pregnancy. If the partner is not a carrier of any known mutation, the risk of CF to the offspring is extremely small. However, the baby will be a carrier of the CF gene mutation."", ""Effect of pregnancy on CF"": ""The two large studies looking at the effect of pregnancy on CF are contradictory. A North American study suggested no deleterious effects of pregnancy on CF or worsening of lung function. In contrast, a UK study suggested that those with poor lung function delivered earlier, and those delivering earlier lost more pulmonary function compared with non-pregnant CF controls matched by severity."", ""Pneumonia in pregnancy"": ""Pregnancy is considered to be a state of relative immunosuppression. Studies have shown that maternal cell-mediated immunity is depressed during pregnancy. In the second and third trimesters, maternal lymphocytes show a decreased proliferative response to both soluble antigens and allogenic lymphocytes. A reduction in T helper cells results in a lower helper/suppressor ratio, causing decreased antibody production. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes show a reduction in the chemotactic response during pregnancy.Despite this immunosuppression, the prevalence of pneumonia in pregnancy is no different compared with the non-pregnant individual. However, complications associated with pneumonia may be more common. The most common causes of pneumonia are bacterial, viral and aspiration.The common organisms causing pneumonia in pregnancy are summarized in Table 2 , and are similar to those found in non-pregnant women."", ""Bacterial"": ""Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common pathogen, and is identified in 30-50% of all pneumonias. Mycoplasma is identified in about 10% of antepartum pneumonias. Mortality from mycoplasma is rare, and recovery generally occurs 10-14 days after the onset of symptoms. Although legionella is encountered in 5% of women, the mortality rate can be as high as 20%."", ""Viral"": ""Type A influenza is a frequent cause of viral pneumonia, and is associated with more risks in pregnancy than in the non-pregnant state. Varicella pneumonia may occur in up to 20% of pregnant women with varicella infection. Pneumonia develops 3-6 days after vesicular eruption. The chest Xray typically shows a diffuse nodular pattern. If varicella pneumonia is suspected in a pregnant woman, it is prudent to admit her to hospital for observation and to treat with Acyclovir. Maternal infection with measles (Rubeola) should also be closely observed for developments of complications including pneumonia. Antibiotic treatment is recommended in the event of super-added bacterial infection."", ""Human immunodeficiency virus"": ""Similar to the non-pregnant state, pneumocystis (PCP) and tuberculosis are the most frequent pulmonary complications in pregnant women infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Pregnancy does not appreciably alter the work-up and management of HIV-associated pneumonia except for issues related to potential fetal effects. PCP has a more aggressive course during pregnancy, with increased morbidity and mortality. Maternal and fetal outcomes remain dismal. Treatment with sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, compared with other therapies, may result in an improved outcome. Withholding appropriate PCP prophylaxis may have an adverse effect on maternal and fetal outcomes. More than 80% of women with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are of reproductive age, and PCP is the most common cause of AIDS-related death in pregnant women in the USA. Among 22 cases recently reviewed in the Division of Infectious Diseases, Brooklyn, New York, USA, the mortality rate was 50% (11 of 22 patients), which is higher than that usually reported for HIV-infected individuals with PCP. Respiratory failure developed in 13 patients (59%), and mechanical ventilation was therefore required; the survival rate in patients requiring mechanical ventilation was 31%. Maternal and fetal outcomes were better in cases of PCP during the third trimester of pregnancy.Coccidioidomycosis carries an increased risk of dissemination and higher mortality in pregnancy. If dissemination occurs, treatment with Amphotericin-B is indicated. Amphotericin has been widely used without evidence of teratogenicity. The use of fluconazole as a first-line therapy is not recommended due to the risk of fetal malformations. Bacterial pneumonia is more frequent in HIVpositive individuals than in seronegative controls, and the risk is highest among those with CD4 lymphocyte counts below 200/mm 3 and among injection-drug users. There is evidence of a change in the causative organisms of pneumonia in pregnancy. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is becoming a common cause of both community acquired and nosocomial bacterial pneumonia in hospitalized patients with HIV, especially in those with low leukocyte and CD4 \u00fe lymphocyte counts. Although the incidence of nosocomial bacterial pneumonia, as well of other opportunistic infections, decreased considerably with the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy, it still represents an important cause of mortality.The global HIV epidemic is increasing the tuberculosis all-cause mortality. As well as affecting the individuals, increased caseloads due to HIV may also contribute to increased mortality by reducing the health system's ability to provide adequate care.Terminating the pregnancy is not usually beneficial to the maternal outcome unless improving the respiratory capacity may improve the condition. In addition, there are ethical dilemmas of terminating a pregnancy without maternal consent if the mother is unconscious."", ""Aspiration pneumonia"": ""Pregnant women are at an increased risk of aspiration due to increased intra-abdominal "", ""Granulomatous diseases Tuberculosis"": ""Tuberculosis (TB) is becoming an important infection, particularly with the increasing prevalence of HIV seropositivity. Treatment regimens consist of an initial (intensive) phase lasting 2 months. During the initial phase, normally consisting of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, the tubercle bacilli are killed rapidly. This is followed by a continuation phase, usually lasting 4 or 6 months. Patients negative for HIV, with smearnegative pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB that is fully drug susceptible, have little risk of selecting resistant bacilli because their lesions generally harbour fewer bacilli. However, since initial resistance to isoniazid is common in many areas, and HIV testing of tuberculosis patients is not practiced routinely, it is now recommended that ethambutol be included as a fourth drug during the initial phase of treatment for most patients with smear-negative pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. Ethambutol may be omitted for patients with non-cavitary, smear-negative pulmonary TB who are known to be HIV-negative, patients known to be infected with fully drug-susceptible bacilli, and young children with primary TB. Breastfeeding is safe while the mother is receiving antituberculous therapy."", ""Sarcoidosis"": ""Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown aetiology. Sarcoidosis complicates approximately one in 2000 pregnancies. Most often, patients are asymptomatic, but chest symptoms may occur. Erythema nodosum, arthropathy, fever, hypercalcaemia and central nervous system (CNS) involvement may be the presenting symptoms. It may be associated with an abnormal chest X-ray (Hilar lymphadenopathy) in 30% or erythema nodosum with arthralgia in 30%. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level is used outside pregnancy to monitor disease activity, but is of no use in pregnancy due to the physiological increase in serum ACE levels in pregnancy. Sarcoidosis is usually self-limiting and does not require therapy. There are no risks to the fetus, although placental sarcoid granulomas have been reported. Therapy may be indicated in the event of CNS symptoms or impairment of respiratory function. Systemic steroids are useful for improvement of the disease. If the patient is already on steroids, they should be continued during the pregnancy. The disease course is often unaltered and sometimes improved in pregnancy. Increase in the steroid dosage after delivery should be considered because post-partum relapse is common. Pregnant women with sarcoidosis should avoid vitamin D as this can precipitate hypercalcaemia."", ""Acute respiratory distress in pregnancy"": ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first reported in 2003 in south-east Asia. The causative organism is a new coronavirus that induces symptoms of an atypical pneumonia, but some patients rapidly progress towards adult respiratory distress syndrome. This results in significant hypoxia. The infection may produce a unique set of problems if encountered with pregnancy. It may cause a miscarriage in early pregnancy, IUGR, fetal distress and intra-uterine death. Maternal oxygen saturation should be maintained above 95%, and mothers should be nursed in the upright position. Women on ventilators are best nursed in the left lateral position in order to maximize uteroplacental blood flow. Cardiotocography with ultrasound assessment of fetal growth and Doppler assessment of blood flow are recommended as fetal monitoring measures. SARS is a very contagious disease and appropriate isolation and infection control protocols are necessary in order to avoid accidental infection of the medical staff. A small group of health professionals should be allocated to look after infected patients, and they should be periodically monitored for signs of early infection. The risk of infection is particularly high at the time of vaginal or operative delivery, and additional precautions such as negative pressure air circulation are recommended. Broadspectrum antibiotics (Clarithromycin and co-amoxyclav in pregnancy) are recommended to prevent concomitant bacterial infection. Ribavarin, an antiviral agent, is tried in SARS with clinical deterioration. However, it is a known teratogen in animals, so it should be used in pregnancy with extreme caution. Termination of pregnancy should be recommended in women exposed to this agent in early pregnancy. High doses of steroids are also recommended in sick patients. Bacterial infection as a side-effect of maternal steroid therapy is known, and should be guarded against. SARS virus infection may be particularly severe in pregnancy, and pregnancy termination is an option. Early delivery will reduce the oxygen requirements, and this may be vitally important in critically ill patients. Rapid deterioration, multi-organ failure, fetal compromise and failure to maintain maternal oxygenation, even on ventilator support, along with other obstetric reasons constitute indications for early delivery."", ""Severe restrictive lung disease"": ""Restrictive ventilatory defects are characterized by a reduction in lung volumes associated with an increase in the forced expiratory volume in 1 s:FVC ratio when lung expansion is limited. This is due to alterations in the lung parenchyma or because of abnormalities in the pleura, chest wall or neuromuscular apparatus.The majority of pulmonary diseases have their onset after the childbearing years. Chronic respiratory failure due to restrictive lung disorders appears to be well tolerated in pregnancy provided that the vital capacity is greater than 1 l and there is no secondary pulmonary hypertension."", ""Carbon monoxide poisoning"": ""Carbon monoxide is an odourless, tasteless gas that has a high affinity for and binding to haemoglobin, thus displacing oxygen and impeding its transfer. As fetal haemoglobin has a higher afinity for carbon monoxide, fetal carboxyhaemoglobin levels are 10-15% higher than the mother's. Pregnant women and their fetuses do not tolerate excessive carbon monoxide inhalation. Symptoms usually appear when carboxyhaemoglobin levels are 20-30%. Levels over 50% may be fatal to the mother and, presumably, lower levels are fatal to the fetus. Treatment is supportive with administration of 100% or hyperbaric oxygen.Practice points * Offer prepregnancy counselling to women with asthma regarding the importance and safety of continuing their asthma medications during pregnancy to ensure good asthma control.* Monitor pregnant women with asthma closely so that any change in course can be matched with an appropriate change of treatment. * For acute asthma, give drug therapy as for the non-pregnant patient. Deliver oxygen immediately to maintain saturation above 95%. Acute asthma in pregnancy should be treated vigorously in hospital. * b2 agonists, inhaled steroids, and oral or intravenous theophyllines should all be used as normal during pregnancy. * Use steroid tablets as normal when indicated in pregnancy. Steroids should never be withheld because of pregnancy. * Do not commence leukotriene antagonists during pregnancy. They may be continued in women who have demonstrated significant improvement in asthma control with these agents prior to pregnancy that has not been achievable with other medications. * Advise women that acute asthma is rare in labour. If anaesthesia is required, regional block is preferable to general anaesthesia. Prostaglandin E2 is safe in asthmatics, but prostaglandin F2a should be used with extreme caution because of the risk of bronchospasm. * Encourage women to breastfeed. Use asthma medications as normal during lactation according to the recommendations of the manufacturer.""}",Respiratory disease in pregnancy,"A variety of respiratory complications can be encountered in pregnancy. An understanding of the pathophysiology of pregnancy is important in the management of such complications. Despite the changes in immunity, the incidence of respiratory infections is not higher in pregnancy. Asthma is the most common preexisting medical disorder encountered in pregnancy, and its prevalence in women of childbearing age is increasing. There is a slight increase in the risk to the pregnancy, but suboptimal therapy is the most common reason for poor control. X-rays should be obtained whenever clinically indicated, and most drugs used in the management of asthma have a long track record of safety. For women with poor control in pregnancy, there should be good liaison between the respiratory physician and the obstetrician. Tuberculosis is increasingly important and may complicate human immunodeficiency virus infection. First-line antituberculous drugs can safely be administered in pregnancy and lactation.",10.1016/j.curobgyn.2004.02.002,Elsevier; Medline; PMC,PMC7135720,32288339.0,no-cc,2004-05-06,Curr Obstet Gynaecol,,,,71867312.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.curobgyn.2004.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288339/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0957584704000319; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957584704000319,2004.0,paper
3a3b128ae1e3f8d24025bfc1cfa5badaed57162b,Jonathan Schofield; Leelarathna Lalantha; Hood Thabit,"University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; University of Manchester, Manchester, UK",; ; ,"{""BACKGROUND"": ""On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organisation (WHO) was informed of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. On 12 January 2020 it was announced that a novel coronavirus had been identified [32] . Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses and although most are responsible for mild disease, such as the common cold, they have also been responsible for more severe disease outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) in 2002-2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2012 [38] .Having declared this outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, WHO named the syndrome caused by this novel coronavirus COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) [40] . The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 infection appears remarkably heterogeneous, ranging from very mild symptoms to multi-organ failure and death."", ""DIABETES AS A PRE-EXISTING HEALTH CONDITION"": ""There is a perception that people with diabetes are at higher risk both of infection and severe disease from COVID-19 [27] . People with type 1 diabetes who have glucose values close to target may not be at greater risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 [23] . Similarly, as evidence accumulates that many people infected with COVID-19 remain asymptomatic [40] , it remains uncertain exactly what additional risk pre-existing diabetes poses. Although the risk of contracting COVID-19 may be no greater, viral infections can cause more severe symptoms and complications in people with diabetes [24] . It should also be noted that a number of people with diabetes are at increased risk due to concomitant immunosuppression following solid organ transplantation [39] .Early reports from Wuhan province revealed that those with diabetes mellitus were overrepresented among the most severely ill patients with COVID-19 [16, 19] . This finding is in keeping with an analysis of people hospitalised by SARS-CoV, where even transient hyperglycaemia was associated with increased mortality [41] . Diabetes was also identified as being one of the most common comorbidities in a case series of 5700 patients in the New York City area requiring hospitalisation for SARS-CoV-2 [35] .Proposed mechanisms to explain the observed association between diabetes and SARS-CoV-2 include chronic inflammation, an impaired immune response, increased coagulation activity, and direct pancreatic islet cell injury [20] . Well-controlled diabetes is associated with better outcomes than poorly controlled diabetes [46] , but even short-term hyperglycaemia can stun the innate immune system [22] . Emerging evidence suggests that in the context of COVID-19, acute hyperglycaemia may be a greater risk factor for adverse outcomes than a diagnosis of diabetes [6] .The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlights the importance of understanding shared disease pathophysiology, particularly where it might inform therapeutic choices for people with diabetes. Emerging data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is also common in patients with hypertension and cardiovascular disease, although the prevalence rate has varied in different studies as well as globally [37] . Obesity is also a risk factor for more severe COVID-19-related illness [14] . In a meta-analysis of eight studies (n = 46,248) the odds ratio of severe SARS-CoV-2 was not significantly higher in patients with diabetes, unlike hypertension and cardiovascular disease [42] . It may therefore be more appropriate to say that complications and comorbidities linked to diabetes are associated with a higher mortality rate than the presence of diabetes per se [17] . The apparent association with worse outcomes might also reflect the higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes in older people [7] .Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is now established as the SARS-CoV receptor but with conflicting data as to its translational relevance [43] . A role for ACE2 in explaining the association between cardiovascular disease in diabetes and SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested.ACE2 expression is reduced in people with diabetes possibly as a result of glycosylation, but expression is increased in patients taking ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers [30] . Speculation around possible adverse or protective effects has not proven helpful, and people prescribed ACE inhibitor drugs and angiotensin receptor blockers have been advised to continue taking them [15] . Membrane-associated dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) also functions as a coronavirus receptor [33] but there is currently no evidence to support clinically meaningful effects on immune function through DPP4 inhibition [14] .Acute viral infection has previously been linked to the rapid development of transient insulin resistance [36] . Infection with COVID-19 is also generally associated with an increased insulin requirement [17] .There are many unanswered questions regarding the course of clinical recovery following SARS-CoV-2, and it is of interest that diabetes appears to be associated with increased time for viral clearance [10] ."", ""SERVICE DESIGN"": ""COVID-19 will also impact on the health of people with diabetes who are not infected with the virus but find that their clinical care is compromised because of service disruption. Clinical teams have been challenged to fulfil their general responsibilities and prioritise acute care in relation to COVID-19 whilst ensuring that essential diabetes care continues [24] .People with diabetes continue to require emergency admissions and medical management and specialists have an important role to play expediting treatment and minimising length of stay [29] . Many inpatient diabetes services have looked to increase their capacity in recognition of the reported association between diabetes and hospitalisation with COVID-19 infection, and to mitigate against the impact of a potentially reduced workforce.Direction has been given to minimise outpatient attendances, with movement towards virtual consultations, including support for those recently discharged from hospital to reduce the risk of readmission. Community services should not underestimate the importance of their contributions to maintaining diabetes care. Triaging of clinic lists supports the identification of those patients who might still require face-to-face review. Specialist teams should also acknowledge that clinic postponement will equate to cancellation in a proportion of cases. Traditional reliance on biochemical parameters to inform management decisions in diabetes does mean that access to phlebotomy services must also be considered where useful information cannot be obtained from shared data [29] .Secondary care services that may need to continue at close to full capacity include multidisciplinary diabetic foot services and pregnancy and diabetes services. The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot has looked to remind clinicians that most patients with diabetic foot disease do not need to be hospitalised [21] . Inpatient teams should also ensure that acute foot infection is not missed as nonspecific symptoms are attributed to SARS-CoV-2. The precautionary identification of pregnant women as being at higher risk of severe COVID-19-related illness has led to the rapid implementation of remote antenatal care, including diabetes management. Modifications have also been made to the screening pathway for gestational diabetes [34] ."", ""CHALLENGES"": ""National and locally driven crisis management plans must look to manage anxiety, about the health of clinical staff and the people they care for, but also around redeployment and service reconfiguration. Redeployment and new ways of working will inevitably impact the education and training of healthcare providers in diabetes management, and alternative approaches will need to be adopted.The longer-term healthcare impact of social lockdown may not be apparent for some time. In the short term, interruption of daily activities, including diet and exercise, may have a significant impact on glucose control, as may anxiety and sleep disturbance. Structured diabetes education has been recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) since 2003 [13] . Much of this is delivered through group education, which has been suspended, and may not be able to restart for some time.While technology companies have been quick to reassure users around their supply chains [3] , centres where diabetes technology supplies have traditionally been delivered to the clinical site rather than directly to users have had to recognise the additional risk this carries. Companies have agreed to extend warranties for insulin pumps but have also offered remote pump upgrade services where appropriate.Initial insights suggested that COVID-19 infection increased the risk of emergency states of hyperglycaemia with ketones, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state [28] . These atypical presentations have challenged inpatient diabetes teams and led to some anxiety around the prescription of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. It remains important that people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes follow the sick day rules should they become unwell from any illness.SGLT2 inhibitors have significant cardiovascular and renal benefits in people with type 2 diabetes but are associated with a small but increased risk of ketoacidosis. There are to date only anecdotal reports of ketoacidosis in patients with SARS-CoV-2 taking SGLT2 inhibitors, but they should be suspended in any acute medical admission, vomiting or dehydration [2] . Metformin should also be used with caution in unwell patients. Interestingly metformin has been proposed to have immunomodulatory actions [8] . Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists also exert anti-inflammatory actions and may even attenuate pulmonary inflammation [44] . Although the short-term safety of GLP1 agonists has been demonstrated in critically unwell patients [26] there is still insufficient experience to make recommendations around their use in patients with SARS-CoV-2.With perhaps the exception of SGLT2 inhibitors, most patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms and normal oral intake can continue their usual anti-hyperglycaemic medications. Review of glucose-lowering medications should be carefully considered given the possible implications of increased glycaemic variability [9] . Insulin has been used most extensively in the management of hyperglycaemia in critically ill patients [14] . Insulin also exerts anti-inflammatory actions [18] .Challenges in fluid replacement in DKA due to concerns over acute respiratory distress syndrome and with the availability of infusion pumps for intravenous insulin administration have also been reported [28] . Here subcutaneous insulin regimes may prove helpful in the management of hyperglycaemia where tissue perfusion has not been compromised.Analysis of capillary blood glucose tests in patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to a medical centre in Wuhan suggested suboptimal adherence to current best practice for the management of hyperglycaemia [45] . This is perhaps not surprising given the pressure on healthcare systems, and the increased exposure of healthcare staff associated with frequent capillary blood glucose monitoring and adjustment of insulin infusions, but emerging evidence suggests that good glycaemic control is associated with improved outcomes in patients hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 [46] . Automated closed-loop insulin-delivery systems have been proven safe and effective in non-critical care environments [4] . The feasibility of fully automated closed-loop glucose control has also been studied in critical illness [25] and may be an option. The finding that patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 often developed acute hyperglycaemia following hospitalisation suggests that an opportunity exists for more interventional glycaemic management [6] ."", ""OPPORTUNITIES"": ""The prevalence of diabetes or stress hyperglycaemia in people hospitalised with COVID-19 infection and recognition that improved glycaemic control might improve outcomes and reduce length of stay in patients with SARS-CoV-2 have underlined the importance of specialist inpatient diabetes teams to acute care.The current pandemic has also highlighted opportunities for continuing and expanding innovations in the delivery of diabetes care, through virtual consultations between healthcare providers and people with diabetes, and the use of diabetes technology [14] . Crisis management has created unprecedented interest in remote care from both patients and providers, and removed many long-standing regulatory barriers. The US Food and Drug Administration has also allowed the use of personal blood glucose meters and continuous glucose monitoring devices in hospital for the duration of the pandemic [1, 12] .Virtual consultations might also support people with diabetes to be seen by the 'right person at the right time' instead of waiting months between routine clinic appointments. This might be a physician, specialist nurse/diabetes educator, dietician or clinical psychologist [31] .While group face-to-face structured diabetes education may not be possible for some time, there are opportunities to pilot alternative forms of delivery. Patient-led remote models of structured diabetes education have been reported to improve both uptake and clinical outcomes. The digital version of DESMOND, an evidence-based type 2 diabetes structured education programme, was made free to everyone with type 2 diabetes in the UK in April 2020 [11] . BERTIE Online offers fully remote diabetes structured education for people with type 1 diabetes [5] .Enforced service redesign through this pandemic will also enable other innovations in diabetes care, which might only become apparent over the coming months.

In an RDF dataset, the description of an entity comprises all the RDF triples where the entity appears as the subject or the object. An example entity description is shown in Fig. 1 . Entity descriptions can be large. An entity may be described in dozens or hundreds of triples, exceeding the capacity of a typical user interface. A user served with all of those triples may suffer information overload and find it difficult to quickly identify the small set of triples that are truly needed. To solve the problem, an established research topic is entity summarization [15] , which aims to compute an optimal compact summary for the entity by selecting a size-constrained subset of triples. An example entity summary under the size constraint of 5 triples is shown in the bottom right corner of Fig. 1 . Entity summarization supports a multiplicity of applications [6, 21] . Entity summaries constitute entity cards displayed in search engines [9] , provide background knowledge for enriching documents [26] , and facilitate research activities with humans in the loop [3, 4] . This far-reaching application has led to fruitful research as reviewed in our recent survey paper [15] . Many entity summarizers have been developed, most of which generate summaries for general purposes.Research Challenges. However, two challenges face the research community. First, there is a lack of benchmarks for evaluating entity summarizers. As shown in Table 1 , some benchmarks are no longer available. Others are available [7, 8, 22] but they are small and have limitations. Specifically, [22] has a task-specific nature, and [7, 8] exclude classes and/or literals. These benchmarks could not support a comprehensive evaluation of general-purpose entity summarizers. Second, there is a lack of evaluation efforts that cover the broad spectrum of existing systems to compare their performance and assist practitioners in choosing solutions appropriate to their applications."", ""Contributions."": ""We address the challenges with two contributions. First, we create an Entity Summarization BenchMark (ESBM) which overcomes the limitations of existing benchmarks and meets the desiderata for a successful benchmark [18] . ESBM has been published on GitHub with extended documentation and a permanent identifier on w3id.org 1 under the ODC-By license. As the largest available benchmark for evaluating general-purpose entity summarizers, ESBM contains 175 heterogeneous entities sampled from two datasets, for which 30 human experts create 2,100 general-purpose ground-truth summaries under two size constraints. Second, using ESBM, we evaluate 9 existing generalpurpose entity summarizers. It represents the most extensive evaluation effort to date. Considering that existing systems are unsupervised, we also implement and evaluate a supervised learning based entity summarizer for reference.In this paper, for the first time we comprehensively describe the creation and use of ESBM. We report ESBM v1.2-the latest version, while early 3 We will also educate on the use of ESBM at an ESWC 2020 tutorial on entity summarization 4 .The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related work and limitations of existing benchmarks. Section 3 describes the creation of ESBM, which is analyzed in Sect. 4. Section 5 presents our evaluation. In Sect. 6 we discuss limitations of our study and perspectives for future work."", ""Related Work"": ""We review methods and evaluation efforts for entity summarization.Methods for Entity Summarization. In a recent survey [15] we have categorized the broad spectrum of research on entity summarization. Below we briefly review general-purpose entity summarizers which mainly rely on generic technical features that can apply to a wide range of domains and applications. We will not address methods that are domain-specific (e.g., for movies [25] or timelines [5] ), task-specific (e.g., for facilitating entity resolution [3] or entity linking [4] ), or context-aware (e.g., contextualized by a document [26] or a query [9] ). RELIN [2] uses a weighted PageRank model to rank triples according to their statistical informativeness and relatedness. DIVERSUM [20] ranks triples by property frequency and generates a summary with a strong constraint that avoids selecting triples having the same property. SUMMARUM [24] and LinkSUM [23] mainly rank triples by the PageRank scores of property values that are entities. LinkSUM also considers backlinks from values. FACES [7] , and its extension FACES-E [8] which adds support for literals, cluster triples by their bag-of-words based similarity and choose top-ranked triples from as many different clusters as possible. Triples are ranked by statistical informativeness and property value frequency. CD [28] models entity summarization as a quadratic knapsack problem that maximizes the statistical informativeness of the selected triples and in the meantime minimizes the string, numerical, and logical similarity between them. In ES-LDA [17] , ES-LDA ext [16] , and MPSUM [27] , a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is learned where properties are treated as topics, and each property is a distribution over all the property values. Triples are ranked by the probabilities of properties and values. MPSUM further avoids selecting triples having the same property. BAFREC [12] categorizes triples into meta-level and data-level. It ranks meta-level triples by their depths in an ontology and ranks data-level triples by property and value frequency. Triples having textually similar properties are penalized to improve diversity. KAFCA [11] ranks triples by the depths of properties and values in a hierarchy constructed by performing the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). It tends to select triples containing infrequent properties but frequent values, where frequency is computed at the word level.Limitations of Existing Benchmarks. For evaluating entity summarization, compared with task completion based extrinsic evaluation, ground truth based intrinsic evaluation is more popular because it is easy to perform and the results are reproducible. Its idea is to create a benchmark consisting of human-made ground-truth summaries, and then compute how much a machine-generated summary is close to a ground-truth summary. Table 1 lists known benchmarks, including dedicated benchmarks [1, 13, 22] and those created for evaluating a particular entity summarizer [2, 7, 8, 20] . It is not surprising that these benchmarks are not very large since it is expensive to manually create high-quality summaries for a large set of entities. Unfortunately, some of these benchmarks are not publicly available at this moment. Three are available [7, 8, 22] but they are relatively small and have limitations. Specifically, WhoKnows?Movies! [22] is not a set of ground-truth summaries but annotates each triple with the ratio of movie questions that were correctly answered based on that triple, as an indicator of its importance. This kind of task-specific ground truth may not be suitable for evaluating general-purpose entity summarizers. The other two available benchmarks were created for evaluating FACES/-E [7, 8] . Classes and/or literals are not included because they could not be processed by FACES/-E and hence were filtered out. Such benchmarks could not comprehensively evaluate most of the existing entity summarizers [2, 11, 12, 20, 27, 28] that can handle classes and literals. These limitations of available benchmarks motivated us to create a new ground truth consisting of general-purpose summaries for a larger set of entities involving more comprehensive triples where property values can be entities, classes, or literals."", ""Creating ESBM"": ""To overcome the above-mentioned limitations of existing benchmarks, we created a new benchmark called ESBM. To date, it is the largest available benchmark for evaluating general-purpose entity summarizers. In this section, we will first specify our design goals. Then we describe the selection of entity descriptions and the creation of ground-truth summaries. We partition the data to support cross-validation for parameter fitting. Finally we summarize how our design goals are achieved and how ESBM meets standard desiderata for a benchmark."", ""Design Goals"": ""The creation of ESBM has two main design goals. First, a successful benchmark should meet seven desiderata [18] : accessibility, affordability, clarity, relevance, solvability, portability, and scalability, which we will detail in Sect. 3.5. Our design of ESBM aims to satisfy these basic requirements. Second, in Sect. 2 we discussed the limitations of available benchmarks, including task specificness, small size, and triple incomprehensiveness. Besides, all the existing benchmarks use a single dataset and hence may weaken the generalizability of evaluation results. We aim to overcome these limitations when creating ESBM. In Sect. 3.5 we will summarize how our design goals are achieved."", ""Entity Descriptions"": ""To choose entity descriptions to summarize, we sample entities from selected datasets and filter their triples. The process is detailed below.Datasets. We sample entities from two datasets of different kinds: an encyclopedic dataset and a domain-specific dataset. For the encyclopedic dataset we choose DBpedia [14] , which has been used in other benchmarks [1, 2, 7, 8, 13] . We use the English version of DBpedia 2015-10 5 -the latest version when we started to create ESBM. For the domain-specific dataset we choose LinkedMDB [10] , which is a popular movie database. The movie domain is also the focus of some existing benchmarks [20, 22] possibly because this domain is familiar to the lay audience so that it would be easy to find qualified human experts to create ground-truth summaries. We use the latest available version of LinkedMDB. 6Entities. For DBpedia we sample entities from five large classes: Agent, Event, Location, Species, and Work. They collectively contain 3,501,366 entities (60%) in the dataset. For LinkedMDB we sample from Film and Person, which contain 159,957 entities (24%) in the dataset. Entities from different classes are described by very different properties as we will see in Sect. 4.3, and hence help to assess the generalizability of an entity summarizer. According to the human efforts we could afford, from each class we randomly sample 25 entities. The total number of selected entities is 175. Each selected entity should be described in at least 20 triples so that summarization would not be a trivial task. This requirement follows common practice in the literature [1, 2, 7, 20] where a minimum constraint in the range of 10-20 was posed. Triples. For DBpedia, entity descriptions comprise triples in the following dump files: instance types, instance types transitive, YAGO types, mappingbased literals, mappingbased objects, labels, images, homepages, persondata, geo coordinates mappingbased, and article categories. We do not import dump files that provide metadata about Wikipedia articles such as page links and page length. We do not import short abstracts and long abstracts as they provide handcrafted textual entity summaries; it would be inappropriate to include them in a benchmark for evaluating entity summarization. For LinkedMDB we import all the triples in the dump file except sameAs links which do not express facts about entities but are of more technical nature. Finally, as shown in Fig. 2a (the left bar in each group), the mean number of triples in an entity description is in the range of 25.88-52.44 depending on the class, and the overall mean value is 37.62."", ""Ground-Truth Summaries"": ""We invite 30 researchers and students to create ground-truth summaries for entity descriptions. All the participants are familiar with RDF.Task Assignment. Each participant is assigned 35 entities consisting of 5 entities randomly selected from each of the 7 classes in ESBM. The assignment is controlled to ensure that each entity in ESBM is processed by 6 participants. A participant creates two summaries for each entity description by selecting different numbers of triples: a top-5 summary containing 5 triples, and a top-10 summary containing 10 triples. Therefore, we will be able to evaluate entity summarizers under different size constraints. The choice of these two numbers follows previous work [2, 7, 8] . Participants work independently and they may create different summaries for an entity. It is not feasible to ask participants to reach an agreement. It is also not reasonable to merge different summaries into a single version. So we keep different summaries and will use all of them in the evaluation. The total number of ground-truth summaries is 175 \u00b7 6 \u00b7 2 = 2, 100. Procedure. Participants are instructed to create general-purpose summaries that are not specifically created for any particular task. They read and select triples using a Web-based user interface shown in Fig. 3 . All the triples in an entity description are listed in random order but those having a common property are placed together for convenient reading and comparison. For IRIs, their human-readable labels (rdfs:label) are shown if available. To help participants understand a property value that is an unfamiliar entity, a click on it will open a pop-up showing a short textual description extracted from the first paragraph of its Wikipedia/IMDb page. Any triple can be selected into the top-5 summary, the top-10 summary, or both. The top-5 summary is not required to be a subset of the top-10 summary."", ""Training, Validation, and Test Sets"": ""Some entity summarizers need to tune hyperparameters or fit models. To make their evaluation results comparable with each other, we specify a split of our data into training, validation, and test sets. We provide a partition of the 175 entities in ESBM into 5 equally sized subsets P 0 , . . . , P 4 to support 5-fold crossvalidation. Entities of each class are partitioned evenly among the subsets. For 0 \u2264 i \u2264 4, the i-th fold uses P i , P i+1 mod 5 , P i+2 mod 5 as the training set (e.g., for model fitting), uses P i+3 mod 5 for validation (e.g., tuning hyperparameters), and retains P i+4 mod 5 as the test set. Evaluation results are averaged over the 5 folds."", ""Conclusion"": ""ESBM overcomes the limitations of available benchmarks discussed in Sect. 2. It contains 175 entities which is 2-3 times as large as available benchmarks [7, 8, 22] .In ESBM, property values are not filtered as in [7, 8] but can be any entity, class, or literal. Different from the task-specific nature of [22] , ESBM provides general-purpose ground-truth summaries for evaluating general-purpose entity summarizers. Besides, ESBM meets the seven desiderata proposed in [18] as follows.-Accessibility. ESBM is publicly available and has a permanent identifier on w3id.org. However, ESBM has its own limitations, which we will discuss in Sect. 6."", ""Analyzing ESBM"": ""In this section, we will first characterize ESBM by providing some basic statistics and analyzing the triple composition and heterogeneity of entity descriptions. Then we compute inter-rater agreement to show how much consensus exists in the ground-truth summaries given by different participants."", ""Basic Statistics"": ""The 175 entity descriptions in ESBM collectively contain 6,584 triples, of which 37.44% are selected into at least one top-5 summary and 58.15% appear in at least one top-10 summary, showing a wide selection by the participants. However, many of them are selected only by a single participant; 20.46% and 40.23% are selected by different participants into top-5 and top-10 summaries, respectively. We will further analyze inter-rater agreement in Sect. 4.4. We calculate the overlap between the top-5 and the top-10 summaries created by the same participant for the same entity. The mean overlap is in the range of 4.80-4.99 triples depending on the class, and the overall mean value is 4.91, showing that the top-5 summary is usually a subset of the top-10 summary."", ""Triple Composition"": ""In Fig. 2 we present the composition of entity descriptions (the left bar in each group) and their ground-truth summaries (the middle bar for top-5 and the right bar for top-10) in ESBM, in terms of the average number of triples describing an entity (Fig. 2a) and in terms of the average number of distinct properties describing an entity (Fig. 2b) . Properties are divided into literal-valued, classvalued, and entity-valued. Triples are divided accordingly.In Fig. 2a , both class-valued and entity-valued triples occupy a considerable proportion of the entity descriptions in DBpedia. Entity-valued triples predominate in LinkedMDB. Literal-valued triples account for a small proportion in both datasets. However, they constitute 30% in top-5 ground-truth summaries and 25% in top-10 summaries. Entity summarizers that cannot process literals [7, 17, 23, 24] have to ignore these notable proportions, thereby significantly influencing their performance. Fig. 4 . Jaccard similarity between property sets describing different classes. In Fig. 2b , in terms of distinct properties, entity-valued and literal-valued triples have comparable numbers in entity descriptions since many entity-valued properties are multi-valued. Specifically, an entity is described by 13.24 distinct properties, including 5.31 literal-valued (40%) and 6.93 entity-valued (52%). Multi-valued properties appear in every entity description and they constitute 35% of the triples. However, in top-5 ground-truth summaries, the average number of distinct properties is 4.70 and is very close to 5, indicating that the participants are not inclined to select multiple values of a property. Entity summarizers that prefer diverse properties [7, 8, 12, 20, 27, 28] may exhibit good performance."", ""Entity Heterogeneity"": ""Entities from different classes are described by different sets of properties. For each class we identify the set of properties describing at least one entity from the class. The Jaccard similarity between properties sets for each pair of classes is very low, as shown in Fig. 4 . Such heterogeneous entity descriptions help to assess the generalizability of an entity summarizer. Table 2 shows popular properties that appear in at least 50% of the groundtruth summaries for each class. Some universal properties like rdf:type and dct:subject are popular for most classes. We also see class-specific properties, e.g., dbo:birthDate for Agent, dbo:family for Species. However, the results suggest that it would be unrealistic to generate good summaries by manually selecting properties for each class. For example, among 13.24 distinct properties describing an entity, only 1-2 are popular in top-5 ground-truth summaries. The importance of properties is generally contextualized by concrete entities."", ""Inter-rater Agreement"": ""Recall that each entity in ESBM has six top-5 ground-truth summaries and six top-10 summaries created by different participants. We calculate the average overlap between these summaries in terms of the number of common triples they contain. As shown in Table 3 , the results are generally comparable with those reported for other benchmarks in the literature. There is a moderate degree of agreement between the participants. "", ""Evaluating with ESBM"": ""We used ESBM to perform the most extensive evaluation of general-purpose entity summarizers to date. In this section, we will first describe evaluation criteria. Then we introduce the entity summarizers that we evaluate. Finally we present evaluation results."", ""Evaluation Criteria"": ""Let S m be a machine-generated entity summary. Let S h be a human-made ground-truth summary. To compare S m with S h and assess the quality of S m based on how much S m is close to S h , it is natural to compute precision (P), recall (R), and F1. The results are in the range of 0-1:In the experiments we configure entity summarizers to output at most k triples and we set k = |S h |, i.e., k = 5 and k = 10 are our two settings corresponding to the sizes of ground-truth summaries. We will trivially have P=R=F1 if |S m | = |S h |. However, some entity summarizers may output less than k triples. For example, DIVERSUM [20] disallows an entity summary to contain triples having the same property. It is possible that an entity description contains less than k distinct properties and hence DIVERSUM has to output less than k triples. In this case, P = R and one should rely on F1.In the evaluation, for each entity in ESBM, we compare a machine-generated summary with each of the 6 ground-truth summaries by calculating F1, and take their aggregation value. Finally we report the mean F1 over all the entities. For aggregation function, we report the results of average, to show an overall match with all the different ground truths; on the website we also give the results of maximum, to show the best match with each individual ground truth."", ""Participating Entity Summarizers"": ""We not only evaluate existing entity summarizers but also compare them with two special entity summarizers we create: an oracle entity summarizer which is used to show the best possible performance on ESBM, and a new supervised learning based entity summarizer.Existing Entity Summarizers. We evaluate 9 out of the 12 general-purpose entity summarizers reviewed in Sect. 2. We re-implement RELIN [2] , DIVER-SUM [20] , LinkSUM [23] , FACES [7] , FACES-E [8] , and CD [28] , while MPSUM [27] , BAFREC [12] , and KAFCA [11] are open source. We exclude SUMMARUM [24] , ES-LDA [17] , and ES-LDA ext [16] because LinkSUM represents an extension of SUMMARUM, and MPSUM represents an extension of ES-LDA and ES-LDA ext .We follow the original implementation and suggested configuration of existing entity summarizers as far as possible. However, for RELIN, we replace its Googlebased relatedness measure with a string metric [19] because Google's search API is no longer free. We also use this metric to replace the unavailable UMBC's SimService used in FACES-E. For DIVERSUM, we ignore its witness count measure since it does not apply to ESBM. For LinkSUM, we obtain backlinks between entities in LinkedMDB via their corresponding entities in DBpedia. RELIN, CD, and LinkSUM compute a weighted combination of two scoring components. We tune these hyperparameters in the range of 0-1 in 0.01 increments. Since these summarizers are unsupervised, we use both the training set and the validation set described in Sect. 3.4 for tuning hyperparameters.Oracle Entity Summarizer. We implement an entity summarizer denoted by ORACLE to approximate the best possible performance on ESBM and form a reference point used for comparisons. ORACLE simply outputs k triples that are selected by the most participants into ground-truth summaries.Supervised Learning Based Entity Summarizer. Existing general-purpose entity summarizers are unsupervised. We implement a supervised learning based entity summarizer with features that are used by existing entity summarizers. A triple with property p and value v describing entity e is represented by the following features:gf T : the number of triples in the dataset where p appears [12, 23] , lf: the number of triples in the description of e where p appears [20, 23] , vf T : the number of triples in the dataset where v appears [7, 8, 12] , and si: the self-information of the triple [2, 7, 8, 28] .We also add three binary features:-isC: whether v is a class, -isE: whether v is an entity, and -isL: whether v is a literal.Based on the training and validation sets described in Sect. 3.4, we implement and tune 6 pointwise learning to rank models provided by Weka: SMOreg, Lin-earRegression, MultilayerPerceptron, AdditiveRegression, REPTree, and Ran-domForest. Each model outputs k top-ranked triples as a summary."", ""Evaluation Results"": ""We first report the overall evaluation results to show which entity summarizer generally performs better. Then we break down the results into different entity types (i.e., classes) for detailed comparison. Finally we present and analyze the performance of our supervised learning based entity summarizer.Overall Results of Existing Entity Summarizers. Table 4 presents the results of all the participating entity summarizers on two datasets under two size constraints. We compare nine existing summarizers using one-way ANOVA post-hoc LSD and we show whether the difference between each pair of them is statistical significant at the 0.05 level. Among existing summarizers, BAFREC achieves the highest F1 under k = 5. It significantly outperforms six existing summarizers on DBpedia and outperforms all the eight ones on LinkedMDB. It is also among the best under k = 10. MPSUM follows BAFREC under k = 5 but performs slightly better under k = 10. Other top-tier results belong to KAFCA on DBpedia and FACES-E on LinkedMDB. Table 4 . Average F1 over all the entities in a dataset. For the nine existing entity summarizers, significant improvements and losses over each other are indicated by and (p < 0.05), respectively. Insignificant differences are indicated by \u2022. The F1 scores of ORACLE are in the range of 0.595-0.713. It is impossible for ORACLE or any other summarizer to reach F1 = 1, because for each entity in ESBM there are six ground-truth summaries which are often different and hence cannot simultaneously match a machine-generated summary. However, the gap between the results of ORACLE and the best results of existing summarizers is still as large as 0.20-0.26, suggesting that there is much room for improvement."", ""Results on Different Entity Types."": ""We break down the results of existing entity summarizers into 7 entity types (i.e., classes). When k = 5 in Fig. 5 , there is no single winner on every class, but BAFREC and MPSUM are among top three on 6 classes, showing relatively good generalizability over different entity types. Some entity summarizers have limited generalizability and they perform not well on certain classes. For example, RELIN and CD mainly rely on the selfinformation of a triple, while for Location entities their latitudes and longitudes are often unique in DBpedia but such triples with large self-information rarely appear in ground-truth summaries. Besides, most summarizers generate lowquality summaries for Agent, Film, and Person entities. This is not surprising since these entities are described in more triples and/or by more properties according to Fig. 2 . Their summarization is inherently more difficult. When k = 10 in Fig. 6 , MPSUM is still among top three on 6 classes. KAFCA also shows relatively good generalizability-among top three on 5 classes. Table 4 , among the six supervised learning based methods, RandomForest and REPTree achieve the highest F1 on DBpedia and LinkedMDB, respectively. Four methods (MultilayerPerceptron, AdditiveRegression, REPTree, and RandomForest) outperform all the existing entity summarizers on both datasets under both size constraints, and two methods (SMOreg and LinearRegression) only fail to outperform in one setting. The results demonstrate the powerfulness of supervised learning for entity summarization. Further, recall that these methods only use standard models and rely on features that are used by existing entity summarizers. It would be reasonable to predict that better results can be achieved with specialized models and more advanced features. However, creating a large number of ground-truth summaries for training is expensive, and the generalizability of supervised methods for entity summarization still needs further exploration. Moreover, we are interested in how much the seven features contribute to the good performance of supervised learning. Table 5 shows the results of Random-Forest after removing each individual feature. Considering statistical significance at the 0.05 level, two features gf T and lf show effectiveness on both datasets under both size constraints, and two features vf T and si are only effective on LinkedMDB. The usefulness of the three binary features isC, isE, and isL is not statistically significant."", ""Results of Supervised Learning. As shown in"": ""Conclusion. Among existing entity summarizers, BAFREC generally shows the best performance on ESBM while MPSUM seems more robust. However, none of them are comparable with our straightforward implementation of supervised learning, which in turn is still far away from the best possible performance represented by ORACLE. Therefore, entity summarization on ESBM is a nontrivial task. We invite researchers to experiment with new ideas on ESBM."", ""Discussion and Future Work"": ""We identify the following limitations of our work to be addressed in future work.Evaluation Criteria. We compute F1 score in the evaluation, which is based on common triples but ignores semantic overlap between triples. A triple t in a machine-generated summary S may partially cover the information provided by some triple t in the ground-truth summary. It may be reasonable to not completely penalize S for missing t but give some reward for the presence of t.However, it is difficult to quantify the extent of penalization for all possible cases, particularly when multiple triples semantically overlap with each other. In future work, we will explore more proper evaluation criteria.Representativeness of Ground Truth. The ground-truth summaries in ESBM are not supposed to represent the view of the entire user population. They are intrinsically biased towards their creators. Besides, these ground-truth summaries are created for general purposes. Accordingly, we use them to evaluate general-purpose entity summarizers. However, for a specific task, these summaries may not show optimality, and the participating systems may not represent the state of the art. Still, we believe it is valuable to evaluate general-purpose systems not only because of their wide range of applications but also because their original technical features have been reused by task-specific systems. In future work, we will extend ESBM to a larger scale, and will consider benchmarking task-specific entity summarization.Form of Ground Truth. ESBM provides ground-truth summaries, whereas some other benchmarks offer ground-truth scores of triples [1, 13, 22] . Scoringbased ground truth may more comprehensively evaluate an entity summarizer than our set-based ground truth because it not only considers the triples in a machine-generated summary but also assesses the rest of the triples. However, on the other hand, a set of top-scored triples may not equal an optimal summary because they may cover limited aspects of an entity and show redundancy. Therefore, both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. In future work, we will conduct scoring-based evaluation to compare with the current results.""}",ESBM: An Entity Summarization BenchMark,"Entity summarization is the problem of computing an optimal compact summary for an entity by selecting a size-constrained subset of triples from RDF data. Entity summarization supports a multiplicity of applications and has led to fruitful research. However, there is a lack of evaluation efforts that cover the broad spectrum of existing systems. One reason is a lack of benchmarks for evaluation. Some benchmarks are no longer available, while others are small and have limitations. In this paper, we create an Entity Summarization BenchMark (ESBM) which overcomes the limitations of existing benchmarks and meets standard desiderata for a benchmark. Using this largest available benchmark for evaluating general-purpose entity summarizers, we perform the most extensive experiment to date where 9 existing systems are compared. Considering that all of these systems are unsupervised, we also implement and evaluate a supervised learning based system for reference.",10.1007/978-3-030-49461-2_32,PMC,PMC7250596,,no-cc,2020-05-07,The Semantic Web,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7250596/,2020.0,paper

Examination for bacteria is not routine in bronchiolitis management. However, it is plausible that secondary bacterial infection that occur post viral infections 15 are more likely when the nasopharynx is colonized with bacteria, as found in some populations such as in Northern Territory Indigenous infants. In these children, early (at $2 weeks of age), common (up to 90% of infants) and dense acquisition of respiratory bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis) 16 have been documented. Thus, in study settings like ours, the presence of bacteria in the nasopharynx may be particularly relevant. Secondary bacterial infection may complicate bronchiolitis, and possibly contribute to poorer long-term outcomes such as chronic wet cough 17 and bronchiectasis. 18 It has been shown in children aged 3 years hospitalized with first time wheezing, co-detection of viruses (93%) and bacteria (60%) in nasopharyngeal aspirates resulted in prolonged LOS. 19 Yet, it remains unknown whether co-detection of bacteria with viruses in the nasopharynx at the point of bronchiolitis hospitalization contributes to LOS. This data is lacking and is especially important for populations at high risk of poorer outcomes (e.g. secondary bacterial pneumonia, chronic wet cough etc). 4, 17 Further rationale for assessing viruses and bacteria in the infants involved in our studies was described in a previous paper. 20 Beyond hospitalization, persistence of respiratory symptoms (i.e., post-bronchiolitis syndrome) is increasingly appreciated. 3, 21 Cohort studies report symptoms in up to 40% of infants, 14-25 days post-hospitalization. 3, 22 There are few data on what happens to these children in the medium term (4 weeks to 6 months). Determining the clinical relevance of symptoms beyond hospitalization is particularly important in populations, for example, Indigenous children who have a high risk of bronchiectasis.In the absence of any data from Indigenous children, we combined data from three prospective studies that included 232 Indigenous infants hospitalized with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis, to examine factors (clinical and microbiological) on admission that were associated with (i) prolonged LOS (Aim-1); (ii) presence of persistent symptoms 3 weeks after hospital discharge (Aim-2); (iii) whether presence of cough at 3 weeks was associated with bronchiectasis up to $24 months posthospitalisation (Aim-3); and (iv) re-hospitalization within 6 months for a respiratory illness (Aim-4). We hypothesized that co-detection of viruses and/or bacteria in the nasopharynx is associated with longer LOS, persistent respiratory symptoms and re-hospitalization with a respiratory illness within 6 months of discharge."", ""Study Design"": ""Data from three prospective studies were combined ( Fig. 1 ) for the different aims; two studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT) 5,23 and one a cohort study. 24 Here, we briefly describe these studies as the methods have been published. 5, 23, 24 Both RCTs aimed to determine if different durations of azithromycin, compared to placebo, improved clinical outcomes for infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis (i.e., LOS, oxygen requirement and respiratory readmissions within 6 months of hospital discharge). The cohort study aimed to determine the validity and reliability of a severity scoring system among infants presenting to Royal Darwin Hospital (RDH) with bronchiolitis ( Fig. 1) . 24 RDH is a 363 bed referral center, servicing $150,000 people with geographical coverage of $400,000 km. 2 "", ""Study Population"": ""In this study, only Indigenous infants were included as our previous work showed being Indigenous as an independent risk factor for more severe bronchiolitis. 5 Infants were eligible if they were from Darwin, 18 months (RCT-1) 5 or 24 months old (RCT-2 and cohort study), 23, 24 and hospitalized with bronchiolitis. Infants were excluded if they had very severe disease (admitted to intensive care), chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, contraindications to macrolide use (RCT-1 and RCT-2), received macrolides (in last 7 days), diarrhoea, or clinical and radiological features consistent with a primary diagnosis of pneumonia (as diagnosed by the attending medical team). Infants were similar and contributed data only once for this study."", ""Clinical Assessment and Specimen Collection at Enrolment"": ""Standardized data collection forms were used to record demographic, medical history and clinical data ( Table 1) . Other therapies and routine investigations were also documented. Infants who received additional trial medication (e.g., azithromycin) were treated the same for this analysis as those who received placebo, as no clinically significant differences in either RCT were observed. 5, 23 Severity was assessed using a score we validated in our setting. 24 The score comprised of four components (respiratory rate, accessory muscle use, degree of wheezing and SpO2). Each component scored between 0 and 3, providing a composite score between 0-12. LOS was defined by the treating medical team as time from admission, to time for \""ready for discharge\"" (Sp0 2 consistently >94% in air for >16 hr) and feeding adequately.Infants were clinically reviewed by research nurses (urban-based infants) or at their local health clinic (remote-based infants) 3 weeks after hospital discharge, to determine presence of persistent respiratory symptoms and signs. Remoteness was described as more than 100 km from a tertiary hospital. Any respiratory readmission and investigations for bronchiectasis were monitored by a hospital based study (HREC 07/63). As RDH is the only hospital our target population accesses, all hospitalizations were accurately captured.A nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) at enrolment was tested for common respiratory bacterial pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus) were identified on culture, 25 "", ""Statistical Analysis"": ""Data were entered on an Access database and analyzed using Stata version 13 (StataCorp College Station, TX). As data were skewed, we log-transformed our main outcome measure LOS. Exponentiating linear regression coefficients of log LOS gave us the multiplicative effect of a risk factor on geometric mean LOS, which we re-expressed (by assuming the median LOS for the reference group was 58 hr) as the approximate increase in median LOS in hours. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of independent variables on presence of cough at 3 weeks, and respiratory readmissions within 6 months. All factors with univariate P < 0.2 were included in multivariable regression models (except for viruses-RSV was entered and other variables relating to viruses were not). A two-tailed P 0.05 was considered significant. As this was a secondary analysis of available data, sample size calculation was not undertaken. "", ""RESULTS"": ""Demographic data are summarized in Table 1 for the 232 Indigenous infants included in this study (70% of the 232 were from RCT-1, 23 RCT-218% 5 and Cohort-12%, 24 Fig. 1 ). Most children were aged 12 months (90%), not born premature (75% born !37 weeks) and required O 2 supplementation (62%). No child required intensive care transfer.From the NPS of 229 Indigenous infants (one refused, two did not provide consent for NPS), 175 (76%) had one or more viruses identified. RSV was the most common followed by HRV, WUPyV and adenovirus (Table 2 ). At least one type of respiratory bacteria was detected in 155 (67%) infants. The most common bacteria cultured was Moraxella catarrhalis, followed by Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The NPS from 24 (10%) infants was negative for both bacteria and virus."", ""Factors on Admission Associated With Prolonged LOS (Aim-1)"": ""On univariate analysis, factors on admission significantly associated with prolonged LOS were age and severity score (Table 3) . Notably, antibiotics prior to hospitalization, any virus and co-detection of virus/ bacteria were not associated with longer LOS. On multivariate regression, the only factor that remained significant was severity score. Detection of RSV increased LOS by 10 hr (P \u00bc 0.06), but this did not reach statistical significance. We then examined which component of the severity score contributed the most to LOS (Table 4 ).

All 30 (100%) children had bronchiectasis documented in the CT scan, performed at median 13 months (IQR 7-18) post the index bronchiolitis hospitalization.

The presence of a virus or viruses detected on hospitalization On multivariate regression, previous respiratory hospitalisation and exposure to household smoke significantly increasing odds of readmission but the presence of any bacteria and RSV reduced the odds of readmission.was not associated with poorer outcomes. Beyond hospitalization, factors associated with presence of cough at 3 weeks were previous respiratory hospitalization and presence of bacteria. By 6 months, infants previously hospitalized with a respiratory illness and exposed to household smoke had an increased odds of re-hospitalization for a respiratory illness. In contrast however, infants with presence of RSV and culturable bacteria detected in NPS had decreased odds of rehospitalization at 6 months. Further, infants who were coughing at 3 weeks post-hospitalization were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with bronchiectasis a median of 13 months later.Our study involved only Indigenous children as recurrent hospitalizations for respiratory infections and chronic suppurative lung disease is prevalent in our setting. 18 Indigenous children living in USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand share many similarities with respect to the burden of respiratory illness. 26 Thus, we were interested in finding factors associated with poorer clinical outcomes and possible future intervention points. Studies on hospitalized bronchiolitis in Canadian children found ethnicity, apnoea or respiratory arrest prior to hospitalization or pulmonary consolidation to have more complicated hospitalization. 27 Further, previous RSV bronchiolitis hospitalization was associated with chronic cough and recurrent respiratory infections in early childhood. 17 Well known or \""traditional risk factors\"" associated with severe bronchiolitis in infants include prematurity, cardio-respiratory disease, and being Indigenous. 3, 28 In contrast, there are a few prospective studies which examined other factors that prolonged LOS. In these studies, factors significantly associated with prolonged LOS were young age, increased work of breathing, heart rate, respiratory rate, dehydration, hypoxia on admission, SpO2 <94%, respiratory distress assessment instrument (RDAI) score >11, apnoea, weight, RSV, ethnicity, and winter season. 27, [29] [30] [31] Retrospective studies have described that RSV, ethnicity, congenital syndromes, neuromuscular disorders and existing chronic respiratory diseases were associated with prolonged LOS. 32 In our study, severity score on admission, particularly use of accessory muscles, was the only factor to prolong LOS, once other factors (n\u00bc21) were accounted for in the multivariate regression. None of the previous studies however had dissected which component of the scoring system contributed the most to LOS. Further, despite the many studies undertaken for bronchiolitis, most scoring systems used were not validated. 6, 29, 32 Indeed the most commonly used system, the RDAI score, has limited validity when systematically examined. 33 Within our study, we had validated the scoring system used and showed good inter-and intrarater reliability. 24 The type and number of viruses (particularly RSV and HRV) did not significantly influence LOS in our study. Our results are similar to some studies, 9, 11 but dissimilar to others where RSV and/or HRV influenced disease severity. 8, 34, 35 Reasons for these variations are likely multi-factorial including sample size, different methodologies, sampling frame, age, number and types of viruses investigated. 11, 12 We also found that although respiratory bacteria (H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis) and/or viruses were common (88%), their presence did not prolong LOS. While data relating to LOS and type of virus detection has been previously examined, none of these studies have examined the influence of the presence of bacteria in the upper airways. We found that the presence of bacteria detected in the nasopharynx with or without concurrent viruses did not influence LOS. Our finding of high prevalence of concurrent bacteria with viruses (i.e., 88%) in the children's nasopharynx is similar to that reported by Bisgaard and colleagues among young children of asthmatic mothers with acute wheeze in a non-hospitalised cohort. 36 Beyond the hospital phase, our study reported several novel outcomes. At 3 weeks post-hospitalisation, the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in our study (20%) was similar to other studies (18-25%). 21, 22, 37 Few studies however have prospectively recorded respiratory symptoms post-hospitalization, and no studies have examined for predictors of persistent respiratory symptoms otherwise known as \""post-bronchiolitis syndrome.\"" While presence of bacteria in the NPS on admission was not significantly associated with persistence of cough at 3 weeks, 36 chronic cough is the most common symptom of an underlying lung disease and causes poorer quality of life. 38 In this study, persistent cough was however a significant risk factor (OR 3.0, 95%CI 1.0-7.0, P \u00bc 0.03) for CT-confirmed bronchiectasis 13 months later. Bronchiectasis is particularly common in Indigenous infants in the USA, Australia and New Zealand and hospitalization for respiratory disease is an independent risk factor. 18 In the context that early treatment of bacterial infections in the lower airways prevents long-term lung damage, 39, 40 our post-hospitalization data is both novel and important in high-risk population groups (e.g., Indigenous children). 18 Post-bronchiolitis syndrome is likely highly important especially in high-risk populations. Our data raises an important public health issue with respect to follow-up of children with bronchiolitis, to optimise clinical care beyond the immediate hospitalization phase to improve long-term respiratory outcomes for high-risk populations. We suggest that children should be clinically reviewed between weeks 3-4 after hospital discharge to assess for persistent symptoms and signs and managed accordingly. There is currently no high quality evidence on the most appropriate intervention in any groups of children with post-bronchiolitis syndrome. 41 However, until further evidence is available, we suggest the use of antibiotics when the cough is wet and not improving in a group at high risk of chronic suppurative lung disease, in line with the treatment of protracted bacterial bronchitis. 42 Our post-hospitalization data also showed that children exposed to environmental tobacco smoke and those previously hospitalized with a respiratory illness were twice as likely to be readmitted with a respiratory illness within 6 months of hospital discharge. Surprisingly, we found that presence of RSVon admission and \""any bacteria\"" significantly reduced the odds of re-hospitalization by 6 months post index hospitalization. Whether respiratory readmissions in this population were related to the initial bronchiolitis episode, a new infection or other causes can only be postulated. One possible reason for this could be that RSV detection is a marker (as opposed to a cause) for future asthma and as the majority of paediatric asthma is mild, having asthma is less likely to lead to re-hospitalisation compared to a respiratory infection in our setting.Our study has several limitations. Firstly, our sampling frame is restricted to Indigenous children without the well-known, traditional risk factors (e.g. chronic lung disease, cardiac disease) and who did not require intensive care. Reasons for our sampling frame were discussed above but it also means our data cannot be extrapolated to the general population or to non-hospitalized infants. Secondly, we did not exclude infants that had been hospitalized previously; however, exclusion of these infants did not alter our main results. Thirdly, 87% of children received antibiotics during hospitalization. This may have impacted on nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage, however removing these children did not alter our main results. Fourthly, the children were systematically reviewed only at one time point, that is, at 3 weeks posthospitalization. The decision by the treating paediatricians who reviewed these infants at a median of 7 months post-hospitalization to subject the child to a chest CT scan was based on clinical assessments, not systemized and thus subject to external biases. Thus, we could not systematically analyze the factors on admission that are associated with future development of bronchiectasis. Also, while long-term, prospective, follow-up studies in high-risk populations are required, we cannot unethically subject all children to a chest CT (given the known risk of radiation in young children)."", ""CONCLUSION"": ""In the first prospective study of Indigenous infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis with post-hospitalization data at 3 weeks and 6 months, we found that the severity score on admission, particularly accessory muscle use, was the sole factor associated with prolonged LOS once other factors (clinical and microbiological) were accounted for. Persistent respiratory symptoms at 3 weeks increased the risk of detecting bronchiectasis and factors associated with persistent symptoms were prior hospitalisation for a respiratory illness and presence of bacteria on the NPS on admission. Thus, clinical review, with early treatment when necessary, should be undertaken in populations at high risk for chronic respiratory disease. Follow-up studies beyond 6 months are necessary to consolidate our findings and determine intervention points that can reduce the high burden of respiratory diseases in at-risk populations."", ""AUTHOR'S CONTRIBUTION"": ""Anne Chang conceptualized the study with modifications by Peter Morris and Gabrielle McCallum.

Traditional or known risk factors for severe disease are well described, but there are limited data on risks for prolonged hospitalization and persistent symptoms. Our aims were to determine factors (clinical and microbiological) associated with (i) prolonged length of stay (LOS); (ii) persistent respiratory symptoms at 3 weeks; (iii) bronchiectasis up to ∼24 months post‐hospitalisation; and (iv) risk of respiratory readmissions within 6 months. METHODS: Indigenous infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis were enrolled at Royal Darwin Hospital between 2008 and 2013. Standardized forms were used to record clinical data. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected at enrolment to identify respiratory viruses and bacteria. RESULTS: The median age of 232 infants was 5 months (interquartile range 3–9); 65% male. On multivariate regression, our 12 point severity score (including accessory muscle use) was the only factor associated with prolonged LOS but the effect was modest (+3.0 hr per point, 95%CI: 0.7, 5.1, P = 0.01). Presence of cough at 3 weeks increased the odds of bronchiectasis (OR 3.0, 95%CI: 1.1, 7.0, P = 0.03). Factors associated with respiratory readmissions were: previous respiratory hospitalization (OR 2.3, 95%CI: 1.0, 5.4, P = 0.05) and household smoke (OR 2.6, 95%CI: 1.0, 6.3, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Increased severity score is associated with prolonged LOS in Indigenous children hospitalized with bronchiolitis. As persistent symptoms at 3 weeks post‐hospitalization are associated with future diagnosis of bronchiectasis, optimising clinical care beyond hospitalization is needed to improve long‐term respiratory outcomes for infants at risk of respiratory disease.

It is a leading cause of respiratory virus infections causing hospitalizations in children: some 25-50% of children with respiratory symptoms test positive for HRV (Legg et al., 2005; Van der Zalm et al., 2011) . HRV exacerbate chronic respiratory diseases and increase morbidity rates in the elderly (Gerna et al., 2009; Jartti and Korppi, 2011; Longtin et al., 2010a) . Viral infections cause 85% of asthma exacerbations in children, and HRV infections are responsible for 50-80% of these exacerbations (Kelly and Busse, 2008; Wark et al., 2005) . Surveillance of long-term care facilities in Ontario found that, of 297 respiratory outbreaks, HRV was identified in 59% (Longtin et al., 2010b) . Despite its increasing clinical importance, HRVs are not usually diagnosed by clinical laboratories. Traditional detection methods (i.e., antigen detection) are not feasible due to a large number of serotypes. Recently, molecular assays targeting the 5\u2032UTR and commercial multiplex assays detecting human enterovirus (HEV) and HRV have been described (Gambarino et al., 2009; Jokela et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2008) . Molecular tests targeting the conserved 5\u2032UTR have improved sensitivity and increase the coverage of picornaviruses; however, they do not distinguish between HEV and HRV (Mahony, 2008) . Not all resources, such as locked nucleotide analog primers, are available to everyone, as there are limited manufacturers limiting the possibilities of developing HRV-specific assays (Lu et al., 2008) . Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays have recently been developed for some respiratory viruses (Gianella et al., 2011; Hohaus et al., 2011; Ward et al., 2004) , including HRV (Franz et al., 2010; Utokaparch et al., 2011) , and used to assess responses to antiviral agents and predict patient outcomes.The objectives of this study were to develop a modified qPCR assay for HRV from Lu et al. (2008) , evaluate viral load in 3 symptomatic patient populations, and monitor viral loads in a student population for 7 days following symptom onset."", ""Clinical specimens"": ""Nasopharyngeal swab (NP) and mid-turbinate nasal flocked swabs (NS) were collected by experienced healthcare professionals from 3 patient populations including hospitalized children, university students, and institutionalized elderly. This study was approved by McMaster University Research Ethics Board (Hamilton, ON, Canada). Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease 74 (2012) 384-387 One hundred NP specimens were submitted in universal transport medium (UTM) (Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy) to the Regional Virology Laboratory (Hamilton, ON, Canada) between September and December 2009 from children (0-16 years) representing the first population. Symptoms were recorded upon admission. The NP specimens were tested by xTAG\u2122 RVP v. 1 (Luminex, Toronto, ON, Canada).McMaster University undergraduate students (n = 422) participating in a cohort study between September and October 2009 and between September and October 2010 represented the second population. Mid-turbinate flocked nasal swabs in CyMol\u2122 transport medium (Luinstra et al., 2011; Smieja et al., 2010) (Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy) were self-collected at symptom onset and for up to 7 days. Students submitted electronic questionnaires of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms weekly. NS were tested with xTAG\u2122 RVP v. 1 (Luminex).The third group included 59 residents in a long-term care facility at Sunnybrook Health Sciences, Toronto, ON, Canada. NP specimens were collected in UTM (Copan Italia) from August 27 to October 13, 2010. Symptoms were recorded upon hospital admission. Samples were positive for HRV using the Resplex II v. 2 assay (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada)."", ""Total nucleic acid extraction"": ""Total nucleic acid was extracted from both NP and NS (200 \u03bcL) using the easyMAG\u2122 automated extractor according to the manufacturer's instruction (bioM\u00e9rieux, Montreal, QC, Canada). Twenty microlitres of MS2 bacteriophage (Luminex) was added to each sample."", ""Quantitative PCR"": ""A 210-bp region of the 5\u2032UTR of HRV was selected for amplification. Two modified forward primers (RAF and RBF), a reverse primer (LR), and a dual-labeled probe (Rhino-probe) were used in the qPCR (Table 1) . Primers were synthesized at Mobix (Hamilton, ON, Canada), and the probe labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (5\u2032) and Black Hole Quencher-1 (3\u2032) was synthesized at Biosearch Technologies (Novato, CA, USA) (Table 1) .qPCR was performed using the QuantiTectProbe RT-PCR kit from Qiagen. The 20-\u03bcL reaction volume contained 1.5 \u03bcmol/L each of forward and reverse primers, 0.2 \u03bcmol/L of probe, and 5 \u03bcL of nucleic acid, and amplification was performed using the LightCycler 2.0 instrument (Roche, Laval, QC, Canada) as follows: reverse transcription, 30 min at 50\u00b0C; polymerase activation, 15 min at 95\u00b0C; and 45 cycles of 30 s at 95\u00b0C and 60 s at 60\u00b0C.RNA transcripts were prepared with a representative HRV strain for analytical sensitivity and specificity studies. PCR amplicons were prepared from HRV 60 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) using primers that bracketed the qPCR region (Kiang et al., 2008) . The transcripts were synthesized with the MEGAscript T7 In Vitro Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and purified with PureLink PCR purification kit (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada). Transcripts were quantified using the NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). Positive-sense transcripts were 400 bp in length with yields of 1.50 \u00d7 10 13 viral copies/\u03bcL. A standard curve was generated with replicate serial 10-fold dilutions in easyMAG Extraction Buffer 3 (bioM\u00e9rieux) and stored at \u221270\u00b0C.The specificity of the HRV qPCR assay was assessed using RSV, PIV 1-3, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus 229E and OC43, influenza A H1N1 and H3N2, influenza B, herpes simplex virus 1, cytomegalovirus AD169, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumonia from clinical isolates. To assess the ability of the qPCR to detect a range of picornaviruses, 22 HEVs from clinical specimens were tested."", ""Sequencing"": ""Sanger sequencing was used to distinguish between HEV and HRV targeting 400 bp of the 5\u2032UTR of the HEV/HRV genome (Kiang et al., 2008) . To identify species, a partial sequencing of the VP1 gene was amplified (Nix et al., 2006) .

Only 3 (13.6%) of 22 HEVs (mean threshold cycle [C T ] 32.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 31.7-34.0) were detected by the HRV qPCR assay."", ""Lower limit of detection and quantitation"": ""HRV 60 RNA transcripts were used to assess amplification efficiency. Amplification was linear over a 5-log dynamic range (Fig. 1) , an R 2 value of 0.996, and efficiency (Bustin et al., 2009 ) of 104.5%. The lower limit of detection (LLOD) was determined by testing 15 replicates of HRV 60 RNA transcripts (1.9 log 10 to 3 log 10 viral copies/mL each). Between 2 log 10 and 3 log 10 viral copies/mL, 15 of 15 replicates were positive, while, at 1.9 log 10 viral copies/mL, only 3 of 15 replicates were positive. The LLOD was 2 log 10 viral copies/mL. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was determined by plotting mean C T for dilutions 1.9 log 10 to 3 log 10 viral copies/mL as shown in Fig. 1 . Linearity was lost below 4 log 10 viral copies/mL, indicating an LLOQ of 10 4 copies of HRV RNA."", ""Reproducibility"": ""Next, we assessed inter-and intra-assay reproducibility using serial dilutions of RNA transcripts ranging from 2 log 10 to 8 log 10 viral copies/mL by testing on 5 consecutive days. Mean C T (SD) from 2 log 10 to 8 log 10 ranged from 33.02 (1.14) to 17.52 (0.03) within runs, and 32.57 (0.71) to 16.48 (0.44) between runs, respectively. The assay was reproducible between 10 3 and 10 8 copies of RNA."", ""HRV viral loads of clinical specimens"": ""A sampling of 187 HRV clinical isolates were tested using the HRV qPCR assay, consisting of 81 HRV A, 54 HRV B, and 52 HRV C confirmed by Sanger sequencing. All were detected and quantified by the assay."", ""Comparison of HRV viral loads in different populations"": ""To determine HRV viral loads, we tested 36 NP from hospitaladmitted children, 19 NS from university students, and 18 NP from institutionalized elderly on day 1 of illness. Mean viral loads from children, students, and elderly were 7.08 log 10 viral copies/mL (95% CI 6.7-7.5), 6.87 log 10 viral copies/mL (95% CI 6.5-7.2), and 6.86 log 10 viral copies/mL (95% CI 6.5-7.3), respectively (P = 0.67). Twelve children reported symptoms of asthma exacerbations (33.3%), wheezing (8.3%), fever (50.0%), rhinitis (8.3%), and cough (41.7%). Eighteen students reported symptoms of rhinitis (77.8%), fever (22.2%), cough (66.7%), sore throat (38.9%), and wheezing (16.7%). Eighteen institutionalized elderly residents reported fever (25.0%), rhinitis (15.0%), and cough (90.0%). No individual in the 3 populations was co-infected with another respiratory virus as determined by xTAG\u2122 RVP v. 1 (Luminex)."", ""Serial daily sampling of HRV viral loads in university students"": ""To determine the duration of HRV shedding, 14 undergraduate students with symptoms of an URTI self-collected NS for a period of 7 days from the onset of illness and then once weekly. Virus was detected on days 1-7, but none had detectable virus on day 14. Mean viral load decreased from 6.36 log 10 viral copies/mL on day 1 to 2.32 log 10 viral copies/mL on day 7 (P b 0.001) (Fig. 2) . Sanger sequencing of HRV positives identified 5 HRV A, 5 HRV B, and 4 HRV C species. There was no significant difference in viral load found by species (P = 0.81). In addition, no significant difference in viral load decline was detected between species (P = 0.86)."", ""Discussion"": ""In this study, we used an improved qPCR assay to evaluate viral loads in 3 patient populations and investigate HRV shedding in students. This assay detects a wider range of HRV genotypes due to the addition of a second forward primer. We found no significant difference in viral load between the 3 study populations (P = 0.67). Serial observations of students for 7 days post onset of symptoms demonstrated a significant decrease in viral load (P b 0.001).The HRV qPCR assay targeted a 210-bp region in the 5\u2032UTR. This is a highly conserved region with lower rates of recombination compared to HEV (Lu et al., 2008) . The modified primers adapted from Lu et al. (2008) are effective at detecting all 3 HRV species,although not all genotypes were tested and future modifications to the primer and probe design may be necessary as novel genotypes emerge (Faux et al., 2011) . Although the assay does not detect other respiratory pathogens, it detected some HEV (3/22 positives) at a low copy number (mean C T , 32.86). The relevance of low viral loads of HEV in clinical isolates is not known and will require further investigation. In addition, it is not known whether HRV viral loads below our LLOQ are clinically relevant and result in clinical presentations. We are currently investigating HRV viral loads in asymptomatic individuals.We used the qPCR to test different symptomatic patient populations and expected to see different quantities between children, university students, and the elderly to correlate viral load with severity of clinical presentation. To our surprise, the mean titres of HRV were the same for these 3 populations. Sampling with NS and NPS is comparable and cannot account for differences in viral titres (Lambert et al., 2008; Larios et al., 2011) . Timing may have affected our results as adult specimens were collected on day 1 following symptom onset, whereas the time of collection for children and symptom onset was not available. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of HRV viral loads in adult populations. Two previous reports measured HRV viral loads in hospitalized children (Franz et al., 2010; Utokaparch et al., 2011) . Utokaparch et al. (2011) tested archived samples and reported lower viral loads (mean viral load, 1.07 log 10 viral copies/mL) for children than we detected (Utokaparch et al., 2011) . Lower viral loads in their study may have been due to prolonged specimen storage with potential RNA degradation, different assay methodology, or collection method. Future studies will be required to determine the range of viral loads in children as well as how viral load changes over time.We evaluated the duration of infections in the community by testing otherwise healthy university students. There was no difference in the rate of decline for viral load of HRV A, B, or C (P = 0.86), although our sample size was small. Students were not infected with a distinct HRV genotype during the symptomatic episode nor did they experience a second episode. Additional studies with larger numbers of healthy individuals will be required to determine whether there are differences in viral loads across different HRV species.The qPCR assay described here conducts rapid, sensitive, and precise quantitation of HRV. To date, there are no data on viral loads at various times following infection of hospitalized patients. Observations of hospitalized patients allowing comparisons to community infections may be warranted. qPCR tests provide accurate tools for Log 10 viral copies/ml Day Fig. 2 . Longitudinal surveillance of HRV viral loads in university students. Self-collected mid-turbinate nasal swabs (n = 98) were serially submitted over a 7-day period by undergraduate students (n = 14) following the onset of upper respiratory tract infection. Fourteen nasal swabs were tested per time point. Data are plotted as mean viral loads (log 10 viral copies/mL) and SEM for various days following onset of symptoms (P b 0.001).investigation of HRV viral loads and could be used to measure novel antivirals currently under development.""}",Use of an improved quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay to determine differences in human rhinovirus viral loads in different populations,"Human rhinoviruses (HRV) frequently cause acute respiratory infections and chronic respiratory disease exacerbations. However, testing is not generally offered. We developed a modified HRV quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay to assess viral loads in the community and hospital patients. The assay had a lower limit of detection of 2 log(10) viral copies/mL and displayed linearity over 5 log(10) viral copies, with a lower limit of quantitation of 4 log(10) viral copies/mL. Mean viral loads (95% confidence interval) for hospitalized children, university students, and institutionalized elderly, were 7.08 log(10) viral copies/mL (6.7–7.5), 6.87 log(10) viral copies/mL (6.5–7.2), and 7.09 log(10) viral copies/mL (6.9–7.3), respectively (P = 0.67). Serial specimens of 14 university students showed a decrease of mean viral loads from 6.36 log(10) viral copies/mL on day 1 to 2.32 log(10) viral copies/mL 7 days past symptom onset (P < 0.001). Using an HRV qPCR, we showed that viral loads did not differ between the community and hospitalized populations and significantly decreased following symptoms onset in healthy individuals.",10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2012.08.023,Elsevier; Medline; PMC,PMC7127517,23017257.0,no-cc,2012-09-24,Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,,,,36248741.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2012.08.023; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0732889312003525; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732889312003525; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23017257/,2012.0,paper

In the period until 17 th of June, a total of 3085 cases were laboratory confirmed, of which 168 with fatal outcome [1] . On 17 th of March 2020 BH declared national emergency followed by introduction of very restrictive measures on international movement, social distancing, mandatory use of personal protective equipment and lockdown for the population under 18 and above 65 years. Despite having 13 different health authorities and no state ministry of health due to complex governmental structure, it is generally agreed that BH authorities successfully implemented case detecting and tracing practices keeping epidemic scenario not to overwhelm health care capacities. Cease of restrictive measures started mid-May 2020 and, regardless of the current new cases numbers increase in the first half of June, authorities are keeping the plan to return to pre epidemic life conditions. BH scientific community has a significant experience in, and previously established capacity for, a wide specter of both human and animal virologic genetic analysis [2, 3, 4, 5] . As a result, several scientific teams were prepared to be involved in a joint mission of genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in BH. Objectives of this research were: To share obtained sequences of the complete genome of SARS-CoV-2 strains from clinical samples of BiH patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and To contribute to the understanding of the interaction of molecular and classical epidemiology findings of COVID 19 in BH and the whole region and give recommendations for the improvement of prevention and future measures."", ""Samples, RNA extraction and whole genome sequencing (WGS)"": ""The samples used in this study were nasopharyngeal swabs in Viral Transport Medium from four patients, originating from Tuzla, Sarajevo, Livno and Banja Luka, and RT-PCR COVID-19 confirmed on 6, 8, 11, and 29 of April 2020, respectively ( Samples from Livno and Banja Luka were processed at the laboratory of Veterinary Faculty Sarajevo (VFS) and samples from Tuzla and Sarajevo at the Alea Genetic Center, Sarajevo (AGC). A total of 140 \u03bcL of each sample was used for RNA extraction by QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany), and the product of extraction was later used for further analysis, while the rest of the samples were used for virus isolation on various cell lines at the VFS (data not shown here). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the samples was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR using HKU protocol [6] , and the cycle threshold (Ct) values were 17,1; 21,3; 24,6 and 20,4 for Livno, Banja Luka, Tuzla and Sarajevo samples, respectively.Livno and Banja Luka samples WGS was performed according to the ARTIC amplicon sequencing protocol for MinION for nCoV-2019, which uses two primer pools to generate the sequence, as described elsewhere [7] . The sequencing was performed on a MinION sequencer, using an R9.4.1 flow cell on which the samples, as well as a negative control, were pooled. MinKNOW software and the MinIT device were used for high accuracy realtime base-calling during the run, which lasted 17 hours. Only the base-called fastq files with the Q score \u2265 7 were used for further analysis. The bioinformatic analysis was performed according to the nCoV-2019 novel coronavirus bioinformatics protocol [8] .

Sequences were additionally reviewed using BioEdit software.All sequences were deposited in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/next-hcov-19-app/)."", ""Phylogenetic analysis"": ""To perform a phylogenetic analysis (PA) of sequences from Livno (GISAID Accession ID: EPI_ISL_462753), Banja Luka (GISAID Accession ID: EPI_ISL_462990), Tuzla (GISAID Accession ID: EPI_ISL_463893) and Sarajevo (GISAID Accession ID: EPI_ISL_467300), a dataset of 120 whole genome sequences was obtained from GISAID (Supplementary material). These sequences were chosen based on their similarity with four BH sequences mentioned above. Namely, a set of 30 sequences from other countries, displaying the highest sequence identity with each BH sequence, were chosen. Sequence alignment and the construction of the phylogenetic tree were performed in MEGA X [10] . Two main GISAID lineages [11] were highlighted with differently coloured brackets and named accordingly: B.1.1. (GR) (yellow bracket) and B.1 (G) (blue bracket). Four BH sequences were marked with a different marker (red square, circles and a triangle), and bootstrap values were shown at the level of nodes. Livno sequence (GISAID Accession ID: EPI_ISL_462753) is marked differently from other three BH sequences because its GISAID subclade (B.1.1. (O)) is different than the subclade it has been sorted in this phylogenetic tree (B. 1.1. (GR) ). Position 614 in Spike protein, used to characterize the G clade [12] , was shown to be G in BH isolates, assigning all four BiH isolates to G clade together with European sequences (Italy, Austria, France, Sweden, Cyprus, England). The constructed phylogenetic tree in Figure 2 indicates probable multiple independent introduction events as reflected by clustering of each single BiH sequence in a separate cluster, highlighted with red (Livno, EPI_ISL_462753), green (Banja Luka, EPI_ISL_462990), blue (Sarajevo, EPI_ISL_467300) and purple (Tuzla, EPI_ISL_463893). "", ""Discussion and conclusions"": ""We sequenced the whole genome out of four samples from four different BH regions, originated from Tuzla, Livno, Sarajevo and Banjaluka municipalities. Even though all four BiH sequences cluster mainly with European ones, the constructed phylogenetic tree indicates multiple independent introductions of COVID-19 in BiH. Those findings correspond with other COVID-19 WGS studies [13, 14] and confirm the importance of travel-associated disease introduction events for BiH as well. The success of future mitigation measures related to this type of disease introduction will be highly challenging for BiH due to a significant proportion of BiH population living abroad. WGS is a valuable approach for further investigation of the level of association of various modes of international movement (touristic, economic, religious, family visits etc) with transmission chains and associated risks.Recently, significant increase in the number of new cases (more than 280 in just one week and both international and community transmitted) emphasized a need to establish a more efficient scientific and expert system for further work on the genetic analysis of the SARS CoV-2 virus, and to continue investigation of the whole genetic COVID-19 pattern as well. Integration of phylogenetic (molecular) and epidemiological approaches in the assessment of human, animal and environmental data will help with the identification of risk factors for disease spreading and optimize efficient and rational use of preventive measures. The importance of results gained from such approaches and studies will help in communication and scientific justification of social distancing and movement restriction perception in public."", ""Data availability"": ""All generated viral genome assemblies have been submitted to GSIAD.

The virus affects most members of the family Felidae, causing enteritis and bone marrow hypoplasia that results in severe leukopenia. The virus infects kittens in utero and postnatally causes cerebellar hypoplasia and ataxia (Kilham and Margolis, 1966) .Immunization.The first panleukopenia vaccines were produced by infecting susceptible cats and harvesting their tissues. Filtrates from these tissue suspensions were treated with chemical inactivants such as formalin. Two inoculations of this type of vaccine produced longlasting protection (Leasure et al., 1934; Enders and Hammond, 1940) . However, subsequent vaccines, produced in primary feline kidney cell culture and inactivated with formalin, proved safer and more effective (Bittle et al., 1970; Davis et al., 1970 ). An attenuated live-virus vaccine was also very effective in inducing immunity and protection (Slater and Kucera, 1966) . Concern for the wide-scale use of an attenuated live-virus vaccine centers on the premise that shedding may spread the virus to other species, possibly allowing the emergence of pathogenic variants in these species. Attempts to immunize cats orally with attenuated live-virus vaccines have not been successful, but intranasal aerosol application has been effective (Scott and Glauberg, 1975; Schultz et al., 1973) ."", ""Canine Parvovirus"": ""Three members of the parvovirus family are known to infect dogs: minute virus of canines, a defective canine adeno-associated virus, and the pathogenic canine parvovirus. Canine parvovirus is related to feline panleukopenia virus and may have originated from one of the mammalian parvoviruses. In young dogs, the virus causes leukopenia and severe intestinal disease with necrosis of crypt epithelium in the small intestine. Myocarditis occasionally develops, causing sudden heart failure in young dogs. In 1978 an epizootic of this disease occurred in the United States, causing high mortality (Eugester, 1978) .Immunization.Because of the close relationship between feline panleukopenia virus and canine parvovirus, inactivated feline panleukopenia vaccine initially was used to protect susceptible dog populations (Appel et al., 1979a) . Later, inactivated and attenuated vaccines produced with the canine virus proved to be much more effective (Pollack and Carmichael, 1983; Appel et al., 1979b) . These parvovirus vaccines have been formulated with other vaccines, including canine distemper and canine adenovirus vaccines, and are administered routinely to young dogs."", ""Porcine Parvovirus"": ""Porcine parvovirus has a distant serologic relationship to other parvoviruses, but it causes disease only in swine. The virus, which is widespread, causes abortions, fetal death, and infertility in sows infected early in gestation. Immune sows reinfected during gestation give birth to normal piglets.Immunization. Numerous reports have shown the effectiveness of inactivated porcine parvovirus vaccines in swine (Suzuki and Fujsaki, 1976; Mengeling et al., 1979; Wratthal et al, 1984; Fujisaki et al., 1978; Joo and Johnson, 1977) . For example, Mengeling et al. (1979) demonstrated the value of a vaccine in which the virus was inactivated with acetylethyleneimine.An attenuated live-virus vaccine has been described (Paul and Mengeling, 1980) in which a porcine isolate was attenuated by 120-165 passages in a swine testicular cell line. This vaccine effectively induced antibodies and protected challenged animals. The vaccine virus did not cross the placenta; however, it did kill fetuses when inoculated in utero. The virus was shed in feces, and so could be transmitted to unvaccinated animals.The inactivated vaccines now used in United States have been effective in controlling porcine parvovirus infection. Vaccination is recommended for gilts and sows before breeding."", ""B. ADENOVIRIDAE"": ""Adenoviruses cause significant disease in dogs, foxes, and man, but have also been isolated from cattle, swine, goats, sheep, horses, turkeys, and chickens, where they produce mild infections, mainly associated with the respiratory and intestinal tracts.There are at least 80 different adenoviruses, 43 of which occur in man. Each adenovirus has a narrow host range."", ""Canine Adenovirus"": ""There are two canine adenoviruses. Canine adenoviruses 1 (CAV-1) causes infectious canine hepatitis, which at one time was widespread, but now has been controlled by vaccination. Infected dogs also develop corneal opacities following this infection, as a result of the formation of immune complexes and uveitis within the anterior chamber of the eye (Carmichael et al., 1975) . In foxes, CAV-1 produces a rapidly fatal encephalitis.Canine adenovirus 2 (CAV-2) causes respiratory disease in dogs, but neither hepatitis nor encephalitis in dogs or foxes. The respiratory disease varies depending on the strain of virus and bacterial superinfection. CAV-2 may be transmitted by aerosol, whereas CAV-1 is spread by other direct means such as contact with urine or saliva from infected animals. CAV-1 and CAV-2 are oncogenic in experimentally infected hamsters (Sarma et al., 1967; Dulcac et al., 1970) .Immunization. Dogs that recover from natural CAV-1 infection are immune for a long period. The first CAV-1 vaccines were produced by formalin inactivation of tissue homogenates from infected dogs.CAV-1 was first adapted to tissue culture by Cabasso et al. (1954) and by Fieldsteel and Emery (1954) . The latter modified the virus by serial passage in porcine and canine tissue cultures; the resulting vaccine immunized dogs and did not produce clinical signs of infection except for occasional corneal opacity similar to that caused by natural infection. Dogs immunized with CAV-1 vaccines are also protected against CAV-2 (Appel et al., 1973) . The immunity produced by the attenuated live-virus CAV-1 vaccines is long lasting and has drastically reduced the incidence of the canine disease.Although CAV-2 is closely related to CAV-1, when it is inoculated parenterally into dogs, it does not cause disease, although the virus is shed from the respiratory tract (Appel et al., 1973) . Such dogs become immune to both CAV-1 and CAV-2. An attenuated live-virus vaccine containing CAV-2 is now being widely used in place of older CAV-1 vaccines (Bass et al., 1980) ; this has resulted in a much lower incidence of corneal opacity in recipients. However, because of the oncogenicity of adenoviruses in other hosts, the respiratory shedding of CAV-2 virus should be a concern."", ""Human Adenovirus"": ""In man, adenoviruses mainly produce disease of the respiratory tract which varies in severity depending on the virus and the age of infected individuals. The viruses cause acute pharyngitis in infants and children, pharyngitis and conjunctivitis in children, and acute respiratory disease (ARD) in military recruits and institutionalized young adults. Pneumonia may also occur, expecially following ARD."", ""Immunization."": ""A vaccine consisting of adenovirus types 3, 4, and 7, grown in monkey kidney cell culture and inactivated with formalin, was introduced in 1958 for use in U.S. military recruits. The vaccine was effective in reducing ARD in this population (Sherwood et al., 1961) . However, the vaccine was withdrawn from use in 1963 because of concern for possible oncogenicity of the adenoviruses, and of the SV 40 virus present in the monkey kidney cell culture.A subsequent adenovirus, type 4, was passed in human tissue and was, therefore, devoid of SV 40 genomic material. This virus, encapsulated in enteric-coated capsules, proved to be a safe and effective vaccine Edmonson et al., 1966 ). An adenovirus 7 vaccine, prepared in the same way and given simultaneously with adenovirus 4 vaccine, was equally effective (Top et al., 1971) . The administration of a vaccine with only one of these viruses was not effective in controlling ARD caused by any of several different adenoviruses, but formulation of a vaccine with both viruses proved to be broadly cross-protective and have had a major influence in controlling ARD in U.S. military recruits.Since the disease is prevalent only in swine, this is the only animal for which a vaccine has been developed. In examining a virulent strain of Pseudorabies virus, Bartha and Kojnok (1963) found two plaque sizes. The small plaque size variant, called K, occurred naturally and had reduced virulence for rabbits. Further studies with this strain passaged in chick embryo or calf testicle cell culture produced a safe vaccine for swine. One dose induced partial immunity and a second dose yielded good immune responses in all recipients. McFerran and Dow (1975) adapted the \u039a strain to Vero cells and showed that one dose of a vaccine prepared from this passage material was protective. Pigs vaccinated with this vaccine did not shed the virus. Although the vaccine did not prevent infection, it prevented clinical disease. This attenuated live-virus vaccine is used widely.Flocks that have survived an outbreak or subclinical infection during the growing period are resistant to further infection (Schaaf and Lamoreux, 1955) . Moreover, infected chickens 16-20 weeks of age undergo only mild disease, providing an opportunity for vaccination (Schaff, 1958) . Calnek and Taylor (1960) successfully immunized immature birds with an attentuated live-virus vaccine delivered in drinking water. A number of vaccines have been developed including the 1143 strain (Calnek, 1961) , the NSW-1 strain (Westbury and Senkovic, 1978) , the Philips Duphar strain (Folkers et al., 1976) , and a strain grown in chicken pancreas cell culture (Miyamae, 1978) . Inactivated AE virus vaccines have been developed for use in susceptible breeding flocks that are in production (Schaaf, 1959; Calnek and Taylor, 1960; Butterfield et al., 1961; MacLeod, 1965) .A multivalent attenuated live-virus vaccine developed in South Africa by serial passage of several different viruses in sheep proved difficult to standardize. A more uniform vaccine was later developed by Alexander et al. (1947) ; it contained strains of at least five viruses, attenuated by passage in chick embryos, and gave broad protection against the multiple viruses seen in the field. A similar vaccine was developed by McKercher et al. (1953) , who isolated bluetongue virus in the United States and also attenuated a strain of serotype 10 by serial passage in chick embryos (McKercher et al., 1957) . Recently McConnell and Livingston (1982) have been attempting to incorporate more bluetongue virus strains into multivalent attenuated live-virus vaccines.Inactivated vaccines for bluetongue would have the advantage of greater safety than attenuated live-virus vaccines. They would eliminate the possible chance of reversion to virulence, and the chance of vaccine-associated abortion and birth defects. Such vaccines are under development (Stott et al., 1979) .6. African Horse Sickness Virus. African horse sickness virus causes an acute disease in equine animals in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. It was shown to be caused by a virus (McFadyean, 1900) and has been more thoroughly characterized by Breeze et al. (1969) . The viruses are transmitted to horses by Culicoides species and affect principally the vasculature of the respiratory tract causing edema of the lungs, head, and neck. The viruses also cause cardiac lesions.Immunization. Some animals that recover from natural infection may be reinfected, so immunity is not permanent. A spleen pulp vaccine inactivated with formalin was made by DuToit et al. (1933) and administered in multiple doses. Later, an attenuated live-virus vaccine was developed by serial intracerebral passage of a field isolate in mice (Alexander and DuToit, 1934) . However, because there are nine African horse sickness viruses, it has been necessary to adapt each to mice and to combine them in a polyvalent vaccine. Such vaccine has been effective in protecting horses.A cytopathogenic strain of virus isolated from a calf and designated Oregon (C24V) strain (Gillespie et al., 1960) became less pathogenic for calves after 32 passages in bovine kidney tissue culture . This has been the standard vaccine strain and has been used widely for many years. For cattle never exposed to BVD antigen, this vaccine strain is safe and effective; however, persistently infected cattle may react strongly to vaccination with the cytopathic strain of BVD virus, causing a mucosal disease syndrome. It is important to identify and eliminate persistently infected cattle from herds.Attenuated live-virus vaccines administered parenterally to pregnant swine in the latter part of the gestation period produce colostral antibodies. Apparently, in sows previously exposed to TGE, this vaccine produces sufficient immune responsiveness to be of value. The vaccine is also used orally in pigs 1-3 days old to induce local immunity. The effectiveness of this use of the vaccine has not been thoroughly demonstrated. A polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine prepared from soluble purified capsular polysaccharides of the 23 most predominant S. pneumoniae serotypes has proven effective in adults. The capsular polysaccharides are well-tolerated and highly immunogenic; signifi-cant rises in protective serum antibody titers are achieved following vaccination (Kasper et al., 1982) . However, vaccination of infants has not proven beneficial, because they develop no higher antibody titers to the bacteria than do unvaccinated infants (Ginsburg, 1986) . "", ""C. HERPESVIRIDAE"": ""Over 70 herpesviruses produce disease in man and animals. These viruses have an affinity for epithelial tissues and nervous system tissues. These tropisms lead to specific disease syndromes involving the respiratory and urogenital tracts, and the central and peripheral nervous systems. The viruses often cause persistent infections, which can be latent and can be reactivated. Herpesvirus disease are generally much more severe in young humans and animals. Some herpes-viruses, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in humans and Marek's disease virus in fowl, are associated with malignancies.The presence of specific antibodies may prevent or modify the clinical disease but does not prevent infection. Vaccines have been developed for those herpesviruses causing major diseases in animals; however, despite the seriousness of human herpesvirus diseases, including those caused by herpes simplex virus, EBV virus, cytomegalovirus, and varicella virus, progress has been slow in developing vaccines for humans. This stems from concern over possible persistence and oncogenicity of vaccine viruses. In the past few years, several attenuated live-virus varicella vaccines have been tested and found safe and efficacious (Takahashi et al., 1974; Asano et al., 1977; Arbeter et al, 1983) ."", ""Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis Virus"": ""Since the initial recognition of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) in the early 1950s and the later recognition of another manifestation of the disease, infectious pustular vulvovaginitis, this bovine herpesvirus has been acknowledged as a major problem in livestock. The respiratory disease varies from mild to severe, and herd mortality can be as high as 10% in an acute outbreak. The virus may cause abortions in pregnant cattle, and the genital disease results in a chronic vulvovaginitis but not abortions, apparently due to a lack of viremia.Immunization. Attenuated live-virus vaccines were developed by serial passage of field isolates in bovine kidney cell cultures. Such vaccine viruses have reduced virulence when administered intranasally and do not produce disease when administered parenterally York et al., 1957) . Vaccine virus does not spread from vaccinated to unvaccinated contact animals. The widescale use of such vaccines has controlled this disease effectively. When administered by the intranasal route (Todd et al., 1971) , these vaccines had the advantage of producing more rapid protection, but long-term protection was no greater than with perenterally administered vaccines (McKercher and Crenshaw, 1971) . Because of the possibility that the attenuated live-virus vaccines given parenterally might cause abortion, their use has been restricted to nonpregnant animals. A formalin-inactivated vaccine has also been developed, but requires multiple inoculations, and the serum neutralizing (SN) antibody response is low (Matsuaba et al., 1972) . However, inactivated vaccines are used especially in dairy cattle because of concern that the attenuated live-virus vaccines may cause abortion."", ""Equine Rhinopneumonitis Virus"": ""Four herpesviruses affect horses: equine rhinopneumonitis virus (EHV-1) causes abortion which may be epizootic, and also, occasionally, rhinopneumonitis; EHV-2 is cytomegalovirus found in buffy coat cells of most horses, but its role in causing disease is unknown; EHV-3 causes equine coital exanthema, a urogenital tract disease; and EHV-4 is the main cause of equine rhinopneumonitis. EHV-1 and -4 are related antigenically, whereas types 2 and 3 are distinct (Sabine et al., 1981; Studdert and Blackney, 1979) .Immunization.The first vaccine for equine rhinopneumonitis was developed by Doll and Bryans (1963) , who adapted an EHV-1 isolate to suckling hamsters. This vaccine produced a mild disease, but induced protective immunity against the more serious respiratory disease and abortion that occurs in older animals. However, this vaccine sometimes caused abortions, and the virus was known to spread from vaccinated to unvaccinated horses.A more attenuated strain of EHV-1 has been used widely and is considered to be reasonably effective (Mayr, 1970) . This strain was attenuated by passage in hamsters and in pig kidney cell culture before adaptation to an equine cell line (Gerber et al., 1977) . This vaccine induces low levels of SN antibodies, and protects against respiratory disease but not against abortion.A formalin-inactivated vaccine, emulsified in an oil adjuvant, has also been found safe and effective in preventing respiratory disease. This vaccine, in controlled field trials, lowered the abortion rate significantly (Bryans, 1980; Bryans and Allen, 1981) . The attenuated live-virus and the inactivated vaccines contain only EHV-1, but apparently there is enough cross-protection induced by repeated vaccinations to protect against the EHV-4 respiratory disease."", ""Pseudorabies Virus"": ""This herpesvirus is unusual in that it occurs naturally in many species-cattle, sheep, goats, swine, dogs, cats, rats, and mice. It produces a fatal disease in all of these species except adult swine, in which the disease is mild. In each species except swine the primary sign is intense puritis resulting in the animal biting the affected area. Infection rapidly spreads to the central nervous system, leading to paralysis and death. In adult swine, the signs of infection are mild, usually of a respiratory nature, but abortions follow in approximately 50% of pregnant sows. In young pigs, especially neonates, the infection may be fatal."", ""Feline Rhinotracheitis Virus"": ""Feline rhinotracheititis virus, which was first isolated in 1957, produces a widespread respiratory disease in cats (Crandell and Maurer, 1958) . The virus may also cause fetal death.Immunization.An attenuated live-virus vaccine was developed by passage of a field isolate in feline kidney cells (Bittle and Rubic, 1975) . The vaccine is given parenterally and is safe and effective (Scott, 1977) . Low levels of SN antibodies persist for at least 6 months. Vaccinated cats are resistant to intranasal instillation of virulent virus; they may be reinfected, but do not develop clinical disease (Bittle and Rubic, 1976; Kahn et al., 1975) . The vaccine has controlled this important respiratory pathogen and, when combined with a feline calicivirus vaccine, has drastically reduced the incidence of respiratory disease in this species."", ""Avian Infectious Laryngotracheitis Virus (LTV)"": ""This herpesvirus is highly contagious and causes lesions in the larynx, trachea, and bronchi of infected fowl. The infection causes the formation of an exudate that produces the characteristic respiratory distress and rattling in severely affected birds. Birds that recover from this disease are immune for a long period, but may remain as carriers and a source of virus for reinfection of flocks.Immunization.The earliest method of immunization was developed by Beaudette and Hudson (1933) , who applied virulent virus from tracheal exudate to the mucosa of the bursa of Fabricius and the cloaca with a stiff brush. This produced a local infection and a solid systemic immunity. The use of fully virulent virus caused occasional outbreaks of disease, particularly when the scarification was not properly done or insufficient virus was present, and birds did not become immune. The virus was propagated on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated eggs by Burnet (1934) , and this became a source of vaccine material. Other methods of vaccination involved intranasal instillation (Benton et al., 1958) and feeding in drinking water (Zamberg et al., 1971) . Attenuated strains of LTV have been developed by serial passage in cell culture (Gelenczei and Marty, 1964) and by feather follicle passage (Molgard and Cavett, 1947) . Attenuated strains isolated from outbreaks or selected from passage are now used in preference to virulent virus."", ""Marek's Disease Virus"": ""Marek's disease virus causes lymphoproliferative disease in chickens, occurring in three forms: neural, ocular, and visceral (the latter mainly in young birds) (Sevoian and Chamberlain, 1962; Biggs and Payne, 1963) . Sevoian was the first to provide evidence that Marek's tumors were caused by a virus and were transmissible. The virus has been established as a gamma herpesvirus (Churchill and Biggs, 1967; Soloman et. al., 1968) .Immunization.Fatalities from Marek's disease caused major economic losses in the poultry industry until a vaccine was developed for its control. This was accomplished by Churchill et al. (1969) , who attenuated by serial passage a virus isolated from chickens that is parenterally administered at 1 day of age. Thereafter, Okazaki et al. (1970) selected a herpesvirus from turkeys (HVT) that was relatively avirulent in chickens, and Zander et al. (1972) and Schat and Calnek (1978) , selected a natural avirulent strain from chickens.These three vaccines are effective, but the HVT strain has been more widely used because it can be obtained from infected cells and can be lyophilized (Calnek et al., 1970) . The vaccines are given parenterally to chicks at hatching and produce good protection (80-100%) against virulent virus challenge (Purchase et al., 1972) ."", ""D. POXVIRIDAE"": ""Viruses of the family Poxviridae infect most domestic animals and man. From the standpoint of immunoprophylaxis, the most important poxviruses are: Orthopoxvirus, smallpox (variola), mousepox (ectromelia); Avipoxvirus, fowlpox, pigeonpox; Capripoxvirus, sheeppox, goatpox; Leporipoxvirus, myxomatosis virus; Parapoxvirus, contagious pustular dermatitis virus. All these poxviruses cause serious disease in their primary host species and some may infect other species. Each of the poxviruses causes characteristic vesicular lesions on the skin and mucous membranes, with the exception of myxomatosis virus which produces hyperplastic lesions in the form of myxomas and fibromas.Ectromelia (mousepox) is caused by a virus closely related to vaccinia virus and produces a serious disease of laboratory mice. Vaccination with vaccinia apparently will reduce the morbidity and mortality of mousepox in a colony, but it will not prevent infection and may act to maintain a silent reservoir of virus (Buller and Wallace, 1985) .Sheeppox is one of the most serious pox diseases, occurring in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, but it is controlled by vaccination (Aygun, 1955; Sabban, 1955) . Goatpox occurs mainly in the Middle East and Africa; a goatpox vaccine has been reported to also immunize against sheeppox (Rafyi and Ramyar, 1959) .Contageous pustular dermatitis virus is unrelated to sheeppox, but causes a pox-like disease in young lambs in which vesicles form around the skin of lips, nostrils, and eyes. Boughton and Hardy (1935) showed that animals could be protected by scarification with dried contageous pustullar dermatitis virus material similar to that use with vaccinia.Myxomatosis virus causes a fatal disease of domestic rabbits and may be spread by direct contact or by blood meals of insects such as mosquitos and fleas (Myers et. al., 1954) . McKercher and Saito (1964) developed a safe and efficacious attenuated live-virus vaccine by passage of the virus in rabbit kidney cell culture."", ""Smallpox (Variola) Virus"": ""This virus, once the cause of epidemics that decimated entire cities, has now been eradicated. The control was brought about by worldwide vaccination and isolation of infected persons. Another factor in the control of smallpox was that variola virus had no other host except man.Immunization.Material from lesions of smallpox-infected individuals had been used for centuries to infect susceptible persons so they would develop a mild form of the disease and become resistant. This variolation was dangerous but much safer than natural exposure to the smallpox virus. Jenner (1798) practiced an improved form of this method by using cowpox virus (vaccinia) to inoculate susceptible persons, as described in Chapter 6.Most vaccinia vaccines were produced by scarifying the skin of a calf with infected material and harvesting the lymph from the crusted lesions as aseptically as possible. This was stored in 40% glycerol to stabilize the virus and preservatives were added to destroy bacteria. Sheep and rabbits were also used similarly for vaccine production. Vaccinia virus was also adapted to grow in embryonated eggs (Goodpasture et al., 1935) . Vaccinia virus is very stable, can be produced at a low cost, and is simple to administer. These factors played a major role in allowing the wide-scale use of vaccinia for the eradication of smallpox."", ""Fowlpox Virus"": ""Fowlpox virus occurs mainly in chickens and produces pox lesions on the wattles, comb, mouth, nostrils, and eyes. The disease is spread mainly by direct contact with infected birds and blood-sucking parasites such as mosquitoes. Although it is a fairly resistant virus, it is not otherwise very transmissible.Immunization.Fowlpox vaccine was originally made by scarifying cockrel combs with virulent virus and harvesting the exudate. Johnson (1929) demonstrated that dried exudate would produce immunity when scarified in the wing web or applied to the thigh skin free of feathers. Fowlpox virus was later cultivated on the chorio allontoic membrane by Goodpasture et al. (1931) and used as a source of vaccine material. Later the virus was adapted to tissue culture. An attenuated live-virus fowlpox vaccine produced in cell culture may be used in 1-day-old chicks (Siccardi, 1975) . Another vaccine, an attenuated strain (HP-1) developed by Mayr et al. (1976) , is given orally to 5-day-old chicks, then repeated after 3 to 4 months."", ""E. HEPADNAVIRIDAE"": ""Hepadnaviridae is a new-found family of viruses containing hepatitis \u0392 virus of man as well as three similar but distinct viruses that infect woodchucks, beechey ground squirrels, and Pekin ducks. These viruses have many of the same ultrastructural, molecular, and biological features and their surface antigens cross-react to a small, variable degree. The host range appears to be specific for each virus. Hepatitis \u0392 infects man and certain higher primates, including the chimpanzee and gibbon. Infection with these hepadnaviruses results in subacute hepatitis, which often becomes progressive and chronic."", ""Hepatitis \u0392 Virus"": ""The most important of these viruses is hepatitis \u0392 virus, which produces a chronic disease in man (Blumberg et al., 1967; Prince, 1968) . Hepatitis \u0392 virus is transmitted by blood, saliva, and semen, but also from mother to offspring, the latter route accounting for as much as one-third of persistent infections. The disease is usually selflimiting, but in 5-10% of patients the infection becomes chronic, with the virus persisting in a carrier state. There are over 200 million chronic carriers of this virus worldwide. A late sequela in chronic carriers is hepatocellular carcinoma. It is estimated that 40-60% of malignancies in Africa are the result of hepatitis B-induced oncogenesis.Immunization.The development of a vaccine for hepatitis \u0392 was hampered by the difficulty of growing the virus in cell culture. Krugman et al. (1970) was the first to show that hepatitis \u0392 virusinfected serum could be heat-inactivated and retain its antigenicity. They also showed that this inactivated serum given parenterally could protect subjects exposed to virulent hepatitis \u0392 virus. This led to the use of plasma from infected but healthy virus carriers as the source of antigen. Carriers produce large quantities of the hepatitis \u0392 virus, along with its outer coat protein. By purifying and inactivating the coat protein, a safe and effective vaccine was developed (Hilleman et al., 1978) . The coat protein, naturally formed into 22-nm particles, was purified by ammonium sulfate concentration, isopycnic banding, rate zonal separation and enzymatic digestion. The purified protein particles were then inactivated with 1:4000 formalin. The particles induce good levels of protective antibody when given in a series of three injections (Symuness et al., 1980) . However, the high cost of this vaccine has limited its use. Newer vaccines produced by recombinant DNA methods are now being used, as described in other chapters. "", ""A. PlCORNAVIRIDAE"": ""The four genera in the family Picornaviridae are: Aphthovirus, Rhinovirus, Enterovirus, and Cardiovirus. Viruses in the first three genera cause important diseases in domestic animals and man, whereas viruses in the fourth infect rodents. The picornaviruses in general have a primary affinity for superficial tissues especially of the digestive and respiratory tracts. Viruses in the first three genera also have an ability to mutate, thus yielding many serotypes.Rhinoviruses cause clinical disease in man, horses, and cattle. No vaccines have been developed for the infections of humans because of the multiplicity of viral serotypes. The number of serotypes in horses (three) and cattle (two) is fewer; nevertheless, no vaccines are available.Over 100 enteroviruses exist; of these, vaccines have been developed only for poliomyelitis viruses, avian encephalomyelitis, and duck hepatitis viruses. Other viruses in this group either are of low pathogenicity or the number of serotypes is so large as to preclude the development of vaccines. The exception is human hepatitis A virus, which causes a serious disease and has one serotype; the development of both inactivated virus and attenuated live-virus vaccines is in progress (Hilleman et al., 1982; Provost et al., 1983) .FMD was the first animal disease shown to be caused by a virus (Loeffler and Frosch, 1898) . FMD viruses cause one of the most economically important diseases of animals and its control is critical to the world's supply of animal protein. The viruses are widespread and occur in many cattle producing regions of the world. The viruses also"", ""Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) Virus"": ""affect other cloven-footed animals including sheep, swine, and goats. FMD virus infection produces vesicles on oral mucous membranes, including the tongue, gums, and dental pads, but also on the skin including the interdigital spaces and teats. These vesicles on the mucous membranes coalesce and erupt, leaving large denuded areas. The mucous membrane and skin lesions can incapacitate an animal for weeks, thus severely disrupting its productivity. The viruses are highly contagious and persist for long periods in infected animals. Animals that recover from natural infection are immune for approximately one year. Vallee and Carre (1922) showed that there was more than one FMD virus; seven serotypes with over 60 subtypes have now been identified, making the development of effective vaccines difficult.Immunization.The first FMD vaccine for cattle was reported in 1925 and consisted of a formalinized emulsion of vesicular epithelium (Vallee et al., 1925) . A similar but improved version called the Schmidt-Waldmann vaccine followed and contained vesicle material from the tongue epithelium of infected cattle. This material was treated with formalin and used with aluminum hydroxide (Schmidt, 1936; Waldmann and Klobe, 1938) . Another advance was described by Frenkel (1947) , who infected superficial layers of bovine tongue epithelium in culture and inactivated the newly replicated virus with formalin to produce a more uniform product. Although this method is used today in some areas of the world, most FMD vaccines are now produced by growing the virus in baby hampster kidney cells (Mac-Pherson and Stoker, 1952; Mowat and Chapman, 1962; Capstick et al., 1962) .The imines replaced formalin as an inactivant in most FMD vaccines after Brown et al. (1963) showed that viral inactivation was more complete, and safer vaccines could be produced by this process. All inactivated FMD vaccines contain more than one serotype, including the serotypes most common in the area in which the vaccines are to be used. Although inactivated vaccines that are produced and used properly can effectively lead to the control FMD, their stability could be improved, thereby lowering their cost. This is discussed further in the chapter by Brown.Attenuated live-virus FMD vaccines have been developed (Henderson, 1978) but are not used because of the fear that the virus might persist in animals and in meat and milk products from animals (Hyslop, 1966 (Hyslop, -1967 ."", ""Poliomyelitis Virus"": ""There are three polio viruses and minor variants of each. The viruses infect man by entry into the upper alimentary tract, infecting cells, and spreading via the blood to the central nervous system, producing neuronal destruction in the medulla and spinal cord. The degree of paralysis that follows infection depends on such factors as virus strain and virus tropism. The vast majority of persons infected with wild polio viruses show no apparent clinical disease. Paralysis occurs only in an estimated 1% of infected individuals; polio 1 virus is responsible for at least 85% of cases.Immunization.Early attempts to develop inactivated poliovirus vaccines were hampered by not knowing that there are three distinct viruses. The differentiation of the three viruses by Bodian (1949) and Kessel and Pait (1949) was a major step toward controlling the disease. Enders et al. (1949) found that poliovirus would grow in extraneural tissues of human origin and thus laid the groundwork for the development of poliovirus vaccines. The first vaccine (Salk) contained all three polio viruses grown in monkey kidney cell culture and inactivated with formalin (Salk et al., 1954) . This vaccine, introduced in 1953, reduced the incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis 80-90% where it was used; however, multiple doses were required and intestinal tract infection was not prevented, thus allowing the virus to continue to spread.There was an intense effort in the 1950s to develop an attenuated live-virus vaccine that could be administered orally, and could protect the intestinal tract, thus breaking the chain of transmission. Koprowski, Sabin, and Cox each developed vaccine strains of reduced neurovirulence that underwent extensive laboratory and field studies (Koprowski et al., 1956; Sabin, 1955; Cox et al., 1959) . The strains developed by Sabin were finally licensed in the United States; they produced rapid immunity as well as protection of the intestinal tract while preventing spread to unvaccinated, susceptible persons in contact with vaccin\u00e9es. This improved the overall level of immunity in communities. With the widescale use of oral poliomyelitis vaccine, the incidence of paralytic disease in the United States has dropped to less than 10 cases per year. The occasional reaction to the attenuated vaccine is discussed in the chapter by Hogle and Filman."", ""Avian Encephalomyelitis (AE) Virus"": ""Avian encephalomyelitis was first discribed and shown to have a viral etiology by Jones (1932 Jones ( , 1934 . The virus is widespread and affects young chickens (1-3 weeks old). Characteristic clinical signs are ataxia and tremors of the head and neck. Extensive neuronal degeneration occurs in the anterior horn of the cord and in the medulla and pons. The virus may affect older laying birds, causing a drop in egg production."", ""\u0392. CALICIVIRIDAE"": ""Two viruses in the family Caliciviridae cause significant disease in animals, vesicular exanthema virus in swine and sea lions and feline calicivirus. Caliciviruses have also been isolated from humans, calves, reptiles, nonhuman primates, birds, dogs, and fish, but do not produce significant disease in these animals.Vesicular exanthema virus caused a disease in swine closely resembling FMD (Traum, 1933) . Eradication of this disease followed the discovery that the main source of contagion was uncooked infected meat in garbage fed to swine, and the consequent enforcement of garbage cooking laws."", ""Feline Calicivirus"": ""Fastier (1957) first isolated a calicivirus from a domestic cat and showed that it produced an upper respiratory tract infection. A large number of viral isolates, with different neutralization patterns, were made from clinically ill cats (Crandell et al., 1960; Bittie et al., 1960) . These serotypes were later shown to have a common antigen and are now considered a single serotype (Povey and Ingersoll, 1975) . This virus is widespread, having been isolated from cats in many countries. The virus produces a disease that is generally mild, but, if allowed to progress, the lesions may extend from the upper respiratory tract into the lung causing pneumonia and death (Kahn and Gillespie, 1971) .Immunization.Cats that recover from natural infection and have neutralizing antibodies can be reinfected, but they do not have recurrent clinical disease. An attenuated live-virus calicivirus vaccine has been prepared by serial passage at low temperature; this vaccine virus produces only mild clinical signs in recipients (Bittle and Rubic, 1976) . This attenuated live-virus vaccine is administered parenterally; it induces high levels of neutralizing antibody and protects vaccinated cats challenged intranasally with both homologous and heterologous strains (Kahn et al., 1975; Scott, 1977) . Immunity from vaccination persists for at least 6 months and probably longer. The calicivirus is combined with feline rhinotracheitis and feline panleukopenia to make a multivalent vaccine that is routinely used in domestic cats (Bittle and Rubic, 1975) . Inactivated vaccines have also been licensed and are used in multivalent vaccines."", ""C. REOVIRIDAE"": ""The family Reoviridae is divided into three genera: Reovirus, Rotavirus, and Orbivirus. Infections cause by member viruses are common in mammals and birds."", ""Reoviruses"": ""Reoviruses are commonly isolated from dogs, cats, sheep, cattle, horses, mice, rats, rabbits, birds, and man. Only in birds is the disease serious enough to warrant control with vaccines. The reoviruses are commonly found in sewage, and the mode of transmission is thought to be the fecal-oral route.Avian Reovirus.In chickens and turkeys, reoviruses produce a widespread disease called viral arthritis (tenosynovitis). This disease of the synovial membranes, tendon sheaths, and myocardium was first recognized by Dalton (1967) and by Olsen and Solomon (1968) . Viral arthritis occurs primarily in meat-producing birds, and in acutely affected flocks there is a high rate of condemnation. There are at least five avian reovirus serotypes, but they are antigenically unrelated to the mammalian reoviruses.Immunization. Vaccination of breeding stock is an effective way to control viral arthritis. Van der Heide et al. (1976) used an attenuated live-virus vaccine and Cessi and Lombardini (1975) used an inactivated vaccine in laying hens to protect chicks with maternal antibody. This eliminated transmission and protected susceptible day-old chicks."", ""Rotaviruses"": ""Rotaviruses produce acute gastroenteritis in many species, especially in newborns, including newborn calves, foals, lambs, piglets, puppies, monkeys, and humans. The clinical signs are similar in all species; in each there is acute diarrhea followed by dehydration and rapid loss of weight. Secondary bacterial infection may exaggerate the symptoms and also cause pneumonia. The viruses infect epithelial cells of villi, causing desquamation and loss of absorptive function, resulting in diarrhea, rapid dehydration, and emaciation. Secretory antibody is very important in protecting the epithelial surface of the small intestine (Snodgrass and Wells, 1976) ; antibody contained in colostrum is protective when in high titer.a. Bovine Rotavirus. Bovine rotovirus causes a rapidly spreading disease in neonatal calves (Mebus, 1969) . The antigenic relationship of the bovine rotavirus and other rotaviruses isolated from children, calves, piglets, mice, and foals is very close (Woode et al., 1976) .Immunization.An attenuated live-virus vaccine developed by Mebus et al. (1976) is administered in two doses to cows prior to calving. This is meant to stimulate colostral antibody, which is passed on to the nursing calves. This vaccine has also been combined with an attenuated live-virus Coronavirus vaccine and entero-toxigenic E. coli vaccine to prevent calf scours.b. Porcine Rotavirus. Leece et al. (1976) isolated a rotavirus from piglets with fatal diarrhea. Additional reports of this disease showed that it was widespread and warranted the development of a vaccine for its control.Immunization.Early attempts to immunize pigs by oral administration of a bovine attenuated live-virus rotavirus vaccine were unsuccessful (Leece and King, 1979) . Presently an attenuated porcine rotavirus vaccine containing two serotypes, A 1 and A 2 , is licensed in the United States and is being used in combination with a transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) vaccine. The vaccines are administered to pregnant sows by both parenteral and oral routes. At least two doses of vaccine are given orally, 5 and 3 weeks before farrowing, and one dose is given parenterally 1 week before farrowing. This induces antiviral colostral antibody for the protection of suckling piglets."", ""Orbiviruses"": ""The member viruses of this genus replicate in arthropods as well as in vertebrates. The most important viruses are the bluetongue viruses, and African horse sickness viruses. Colorado tick fever virus, the only virus in this genus that infects man, is transmitted by the bite of infected ticks. The disease is usually benign, and infection produces long-lasting immunity.a. Bluetongue Virus. Bluetongue viruses infect ruminants and are transmitted by Culicoides gnats. The most serious disease is in sheep, which develop fever, depression, oral lesions, pneumonia, and lame-ness. Mortality can be high, especially in lambs. Ewes infected early in gestation may produce lambs with hydrocephalus and other congenital deformities. Although cattle rarely have clinical bluetongue disease, in utero transmission can occur, resulting in congenital deformities.Of the 24 distinct bluetongue viruses, 5 occur in the United States. Infection with one bluetongue virus confers resistance to reinfection with that same virus for several months, but cross-protection against infection with other viruses is minimal."", ""Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD) Virus"": ""The virus that causes IBD was first isolated by Winterfield and Hitchner (1962) using embroyonated eggs. It causes a disease of chickens in commercial poultry-producing areas. The virus affects mainly young birds 3-6 weeks of age, with clinical signs of diarrhea and dehydration. The lesions arise in lymphoid tissues such as the bursa of Fabricius, thymus, and spleen, producing immunosupression with the associated opportunistic infections.Immunization.Both attenuated live-virus and inactivated vaccines have been developed to control IBD. The vaccines are used mainly for immunizing breeder flocks to confer passive immunity through the yolk sac of the egg. Maternal antibody protects chicks for 1-3 weeks. If breeder flocks are boosted with oil-adjuvant-inactivated vaccines, maternal antibody may last longer. There are several types of attenuated live-virus vaccines with varying degrees of virulence. These vaccines are administered in water, etc., to chicks from 1 day to 2-3 weeks of age in broiler-breeder flocks, followed by vaccination with an inactivated product at approximately 16-18 weeks of age (Lukert and Hitchner, 1984 )."", ""E. TOGAVIRIDAE"": ""The four genera in the family Togaviraidae are: Alphavirus, Pestivirus, Rubivirus, and Arterivirus. Each of these genera contain important pathogens."", ""Alphavirus"": ""The Alphavirus genera include:"", ""Western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus 2. Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) 3. Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus"": ""All cause encephalitis in horses and humans. In horses, the mortality rate of EEE in over 80%, and that from WEE is about 20-30%. The main mode of transmission is by culicine mosquitoes; however, VEE has been transmitted from horse to horse by contact with body fluids.Immunization.Infections with togaviruses produce viremia, longterm humoral antibody responses, and immunity. Early vaccines were made from formalin-inactivated infected animal brain tissue. The cultivation of both WEE and EEE in the chick embryo by Higbee and Howitt (1935) made possible the development of successful inactivated vaccines (Beard et al., 1938) . More recent vaccines for WEE and EEE are produced in tissue culture. An attenuated live-virus VEE vaccine, first developed for humans, is also used for horses in endemic areas (Berge et al., 1961; McKinney et al., 1963) . The vaccine virus is grown in primary chick embryo cell cultures; it induces long-lasting immunity. An inactivated VEE vaccine has also been developed and is combined with WEE and EEE vaccines in a trivalent formulation."", ""Pestivirus"": ""a. Hog Cholera (HC) Virus. Hog cholera virus and bovine virus diarrhea (BVD) virus antigenically are closely related pestiviruses, but are specific in the diseases they cause in swine and cattle, respectively.HC virus produces an acute febrile disease marked by multiple hemorrhages, necrosis, and infarcts in internal organs. Lethargy, vomiting, and encephalomyelitis are seen in a high percentage of infected animals during an outbreak and mortality is high.Immunization.Passive protection with convalescent swine serum from swine has been used effectively for short-term control of outbreaks for many years (Dorset et al., 1908) . Antiserum and either virulent or partially attenuated virus strains were also used to establish active immunity. Although there is only one antigenic type of HC virus, variant biotypes have arisen that are more difficult to protect against with standard vaccines. The presence of neutralizing antibody correlated well with protection.An inactivated virus vaccine prepared from defibrinated swine blood taken during the acute phase of the disease and treated with crystal violet or phenol was safe, but required multiple doses (McBryde and Cole, 1936) .Attenuation of HC virus was first accomplished by passage in rabbits (Baker, 1946; Koprowski et al., 1946) . Tissue culture attenuated live-virus vaccines eventually replaced the rabbit vaccine; the latter produced a rapid and long-lasting immunity.A large number of different attenuated live-virus HC vaccines with different characteristics have been used over the years, but residual pathogenicity, shedding, and spread of vaccine viruses have remained problems. A vaccine containing BVD virus was tested in swine, based on evidence that this virus could block replication of HC virus (Sheffy et al., 1961) . However, the BVD vaccine did not protect against all strains of HC virus (Tamoglia et al., 1966) .Formerly, control of HC was difficult because HC virus persists in infected meat scraps fed to swine in uncooked garbage. However, since 1969 no vaccines have been used in the United States. By controlling the transport of swine and cooking all garbage used as feed, the disease has been eradicated from the United States, and several European countries.b. Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD) Virus. BVD virus causes a widespread disease of cattle, especially in young stock. Clinical signs, which vary in severity, include scouring, ulcerations of the oral cavity, and abortion. Young animals that recover often remain stunted and unproductive for long periods. BVD viral strains differ in their cytopathic effects in tissue culture; cattle infected with noncytopathogenic strains during the first 3 months of gestation can transmit the virus to the fetus, which may be born viremic and immunologically tolerant. Later exposure to cytopathogenic strains, naturally or by vaccination, can cause offspring to develop the more severe form of the disease (Bolin et al., 1985) ."", ""Rubivirus"": ""Rubella Virus. In man, rubella virus causes a generally mild exanthematous disease, with malaise and respiratory symptoms. Complications include arthritis, thrombocytopenia purpura, and encephalitis. Gregg's observation (1941) that rubella virus produces fetal abnormalities if infection occurs early in pregnancy emphasized the destructive effects of this virus and the need to develop a means to protect against infection.Immunization. Natural exposure to rubella virus evokes nasopharyngeal antibody, which is important in preventing reinfection. Antibody, especially IgG antibody in mother's plasma, is important in preventing fetal infection.Two groups isolated rubella virus in tissue culture (Parkman et al., 1962; Weller and Nova, 1962) , allowing the first attempts to develop vaccines. Both inactivated and attenuated live-virus vaccines were tried before the latter evolved as superior products. The attenuated live-virus vaccines were developed using different cell culture systems, including monkey kidney (Parkman et al., 1966) , duck embryo (Buynak, 1968), rabbit kidney (Peetermans and Huygelen, 1967) , canine kidney (Musser and Hilsabeck, 1969) , and human diploid cells (Plotkin, 1967) . The vaccines now being used are more than 95% effective in inducing protective levels of antibody that persist for at least 9 years. The annual incidence of rubella in the United States has dropped from 56,000 reported cases in 1970 to less than 700 in 1985."", ""Arterivirus"": ""Equine Arteritis Virus.Equine arteritis virus was first isolated by Doll et al. (1957) . The disease caused by this virus is characterized by edema of limbs, stiffness, and swelling in the tissues surrounding the eye, and abortion.Immunization.Horses that recover from infection develop longlasting immunity. An effective attenuated live-virus vaccine was developed by serial passage of Bucyrus field strain virus in primary equine and rabbit kidney cell culture and an equine dermal cell line (Doll et al., 1968; Wilson et al., 1962; McCollum, 1986 ). The vaccine has been shown in challenge trials to protect recipients for as long as 24 months (McCollum, 1986) ; it does not cause any clinical manifestations and it is not spread to susceptible horses in contact with vaccinated recipients."", ""F. FLAVIVIRIDAE (YELLOW FEVER VIRUS)"": ""Yellow fever virus causes acute hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever in man, characterized by jaundice, shock, and renal damage. Transmission is by mosquitoes belonging to the Aedes genus throughout tropical areas of South America and Africa. The virus is maintained in a transmission cycle between mosquitoes and monkeys, with man being infected when he enters a territory in which the monkey-mosquito cycle exists.Immunization.An attenuated live-virus yellow fever vaccine was developed by passage of the virulent Asibi strain in mouse brain and cell culture until it had lost its pathogenicity for monkeys and man (Theiler, 1951) . The vaccine virus, termed 17D, is propagated in embryonated eggs. The vaccine, given as a single dose, is extremely safe and efficacious, providing immunity for at least 10 years."", ""G. ORTHOMYXOVIRIDAE"": ""The family Orthomyxovirus comprises the influenza viruses, the cause of acute, highly contagious respiratory disease in man, horses, swine, and birds. Two structural viral proteins (NF and M) divide this family into three distinct genera: A, B, and C.The viruses, especially influenza A virus, undergo genetic r\u00e9assortaient, which allows variant viruses to emerge. Two viral proteins, the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, both located on the surface of virions, are important in inducing immunity.Vaccines have been widely used for controlling influenza with reasonably good success. Since immunity is more closely related to local secretory IgA antibody than to serum antibody, it is difficult to stimulate and maintain protection with the presently used inactivated vaccines. With human infections, the type A viruses undergo occasional antigenic shifts and drifts, after which the antigens in the vaccine may not be representative of those viruses found in the field. This potential antigenic variability, as well as animal reservoirs for this virus, are responsible for the pandemics associated with this virus. As an example, the acute respiratory disease of swine caused by a type A strain of virus was first recognized in 1918 during the human influenza epidemic and is believed to have been transmitted from swine from humans. Both swine and humans are susceptible to the swine virus. However, the disease in swine occurs sporadically and has not been enough of a problem to warrant the use of vaccines in that species."", ""Human Influenza Virus"": ""Influenza is a respiratory infection with systemic manifestations that include fever, chills, muscular aches, etc. The severity of the disease depends on the virus strain and the susceptibility of the population.Persons that have recovered from an influenza infection are usually immune to rechallenge with the homologous virus. However, the change of a few amino acids in hemagglutinin may give rise to antigenic drift and reinfection of populations.Immunization.Because of the epidemic threat of influenza viruses, careful surveillance for new strains is carried out in many parts of the world. The strains that public health officials predict will be the cause of the next winter's epidemics are then scheduled for vaccine production. For vaccine production, virus is grown in the allantoic cavity of embryonated eggs and is purified and concentrated by zonal centri-fugation. The virus is inactivated with formalin, \u00df-propiolactone, or irradiation. The quantity of viral antigen per dose is standardized before use. The vaccine usually contains several type A viruses and a type \u0392 virus. These inactivated whole virus vaccines produce protective levels of antibody in approximately 85% of primed recipients and in 60% of the unprimed recipients. Antibody levels are maintained for approximately 1 year in primed individuals. Attenuated live-virus influenza vaccines have been used extensively in the USSR with varying results. Problems of adverse reactions, inconsistent potency, and questionable appropriateness of strains make it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these vaccines.More recent attempts to develop attenuated live-virus vaccines involve genetic reassortment, a method that offers considerable promise (reviewed by Wright and Karzon, 1987) ."", ""Equine Influenza Virus"": ""Influenza in horses resembles the disease in man and swine. The two type A influenza viruses of importance in the horse are: A/Equi l/Prague/56 type 1 and A/Equi 2/Miami/63 type 2. The disease spreads rapidly through susceptible horses, and those that recover are protected for only a short time. Recovery from infection with one virus type does not provide immunity against the other.Immunization.Vaccines for equine influenza are produced in essentially the same manner as human influenza vaccines. Formalinactivated vaccines contain both equine type 1 and 2 viruses and one of several adjuvants, as described by Bryans et al. (1973) . Vaccines of this type are widely used and effectively control equine influenza."", ""H. PARAMYXOVIRIDAE"": ""The family Paramyxoviridae contains several viruses that cause significant disease in animals. The family is composed of three genera that include the following viruses for which vaccines have been developed. These viruses are transmitted by the respiratory route and are antigenically rather stable."", ""Parainfluenza Virus"": ""Parainfluenza viruses infect humans, rodents, swine, dogs, and cattle. These viruses, by themselves, cause mild upper respiratory tract disease, but when combined with other viral and bacterial pathogens may cause a more severe syndrome. Parainfluenza types 1, 2, 3, and 4a/4b infect humans, especially young children. Type 3 is considered the most pathogenic, causing a bronchitis and pneumonitis.Vaccines for parainfluenza of rodents (Sendai virus infection), dogs (canine parainfluenza), and cattle (bovine parainfluenza) have been developed. There is no licensed parainfluenza vaccine for man.a. Sendai Virus. Sendai virus, first isolated during attempts to recover human respiratory viruses in mice (Kuroya et al., 1953) , is a parainfluenza type 1 virus that causes respiratory disease in mice, rats, hamsters, and swine. The disease occurs either in an acute-short duration form or a chronic-persistent, clinically inapparent form. Spread is by either direct contact or by aerosol. In mouse colonies, this disease is difficult to control because the virus is so highly infective.Immunization.Formalin-inactivated vaccines have been effective in controlling the disease in mice and rats (Fukumi and Takeuchi, 1975; Eaton et al, 1982; Tsukui et al, 1982) . Additionally, a temperature-sensitive mutant strain of Sendai virus has been used as an aerosol-delivered vaccine in mice. It suppresses virus replication, but the vaccine virus spreads throughout the colony and makes it difficult to monitor for wild virus strains (Kimura et al, 1979) .b. Canine Parainfluenza Virus. Outbreaks of mild respiratory disease in laboratory dogs have been attributed to parainfluenza type 2 virus (Binn et al, 1968; Crandell et al, 1968) . When other respiratory agents such as mycoplasma and Bordetella bronchiseptica were given intranasally after exposure to this parainfluenza virus, more severe respiratory signs occurred (Appel and Percy, 1970) . This encouraged efforts to develop a vaccine for canine parainfluenza virus.Immunization. An attenuated live-virus parainfluenza vaccine has been shown to protect dogs against aerosol challenge with virulent virus (Emery et al, 1976) . The vaccine produces no untoward effects and has been combined with canine distemper and canine adenovirus vaccines in multivalent formulations.c. Bovine Parainfluenza Virus. A parainfluenza type 3 virus isolated from cattle can also cause mild respiratory disease (Reisinger et al, 1959) . The virus, when combined with other respiratory pathogens including Pasteurella and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, causes the severe pneumonia syndrome, called \""shipping fever.\""Immunization.An attenuated live-virus parainfluenza type 3 vaccine administered parenterally induces good levels of antibodies and affords protection against experimental challenge (Mohanty and Lillie, 1964; Thorsen et al., 1969) . This vaccine has been combined with infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus and bovine virus diarrhea vaccines in multivalent formulations. An inactivated vaccine, requiring two inoculations, induces high hemagglutination-inhibition titers and lessens the severity of the disease in cattle challenged with the same virus (Gale et al., 1963) ."", ""Mumps Virus"": ""Mumps virus causes an acute infection in man with parotitis as the main clinical manifestation, although the central nervous system and other organs including the testes and ovaries can be affected. Mumps virus has a limited host range; in addition to man, only certain monkey species and laboratory rodents can be infected.Immunization.Recovery from natural infection with mumps virus confers long-term immunity. Early experiments with formalininactivated virus derived from infected parotid glands of monkeys showed that monkeys and humans could be immunized (Enders et al., 1945; Stokes et al., 1946) . Habel (1946) found that chick embryo grown virus could be inactivated with ultraviolet light or formalin and would induce protection in monkeys. A similar vaccine was later shown to induce protection in man (Habel, 1951; Henle et al., 1951) . Poor antibody responses to multiple inoculations of this type of vaccine encouraged the search for a more effective vaccine.A mumps virus strain ( Jeryl Lynn) has been attenuated by passage in chick embryos (Weibel et al., 1980) . The vaccine is immunogenic in 93-98% of subjects, and neutralizing antibodies persist for at least 10 years. The annual incidence of mumps in the United States has been reduced from 160,000 cases in 1968 to less then 3,000 in 1985 by application of this vaccine. As presently used, mumps vaccine is combined with measles and rubella vaccines in a pediatric formulation called MMR."", ""Newcastle Disease Virus"": ""Newcastle dibcctse is one of the most serious widespread diseases affecting poultry. The disease was first described by Kranevelt (1926) and shortly thereafter by Doyle (1927) , who named it after the area in England where an outbreak occurred and showed that its cause was a filterable virus. The disease has several forms causing mainly respiratory, enteric, and central nervous system manifestations. The morbid-ity and mortality vary depending on the virus strain. Burnet (1942) described the hemagglutinating property of the virus, which has been very helpful in its quantitation and immunodiagnosis.Immunization.A number of attenuated live-virus vaccines have been developed which are widely used to control the disease. The Bl strain (Hitchner and Johnson, 1948) , the LaSota strain (Winterfield et al., 1957) , and the F strain (Asplin, 1952) are used to immunize birds of all ages by different routes, including by addition to drinking water and by spraying.Vaccines containing inactivated virus do not produce long-lasting immunity but may be used in certain situations when only short-term immunity is needed, such as when boosting immunity is needed in laying flocks. Increasing the antigen content and using oil-emulsion adjuvants improves the quality of these inactivated vaccines (Stone et al, 1980; Zanella and Marchi, 1982) ."", ""Measles Virus"": ""Measles is a highly contagious disease of humans, occurring mostly in children, causing exanthemata and sometimes more serious manifestations including encephalomyelitis. The virus has two principal immunogens, the hemagglutinin and the fusion protein (Norrby et al., 1975) . The immunity produced by natural infection is long lasting.Immunization.The growth of measles virus in chick embryo fibroblasts by Enders and Peebles (1954) paved the way for the development of vaccines. A formalin-inactivated measles virus vaccine was shown to induce partial immunity. However, some vaccinated children later exposed to measles virus, either naturally or as attenuated live-virus measles vaccine, developed atypical measles (atypical rashes, edema of hands and feet, and respiratory disease). It was later found that formalin-inactivated vaccine failed to stimulate antibody to the fusion protein: consequently the virus could spread from cell to cell, causing the atypical manifestations of disease (Norrby et al., 1975 ).An attenuated live-virus vaccine was developed from the Edmonston strain of measles virus by passage first in human cell culture, then in the amnionic sac of embryonated hen's eggs, and finally in chick embryo cells (Milovanovic et al., 1957) . This vaccine (Enders Passage Level B) was effective in inducing immunity but produced some adverse effects (Katz and Enders, 1959; Stokes et al., 1962) . Further attenuation by growth at lower temperature yielded an equally effective vaccine that produced fewer side effects (Schwarz, 1964; Hilleman et al., 1968) . Attenuated live-virus measles vaccine has been combined with mumps and rubella vaccines. Measles vaccine usage has reduced the incidence of measles in the United States from 440,000 cases in 1960 to 3,000 in 1985."", ""Canine Distemper Virus"": ""Canine distemper virus affects most carnivores, causing respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system disease. The mortality rate in dogs is about 20%. Dunkin and Laidlaw (1926) first described the disease in detail and confirmed the viral etiology proposed earlier by Carre (1905) .Immunization. Dunkin (1926, 1928a,b) prepared a vaccine by treating virus derived from spleens of infected dogs with formalin. Initial administration of this vaccine, followed 2 weeks later with a small dose of virulent virus, usually produced only a mild disease with solid immunity. This approach was replaced with inactivated virus vaccines, given in multiple doses, which served as the main means of controlling the disease from 1930 to 1950. Green (1945) serially passaged canine distemper virus in ferrets and produced the first attenuated live-virus vaccine; however, this vaccine caused disease in some dogs.The adaptation of canine distemper virus to the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated eggs by Haig (1948) was a major step in developing an attenuated live-virus vaccine. Cabasso and Cox (1949) applied this method and after 28 passages showed that the virus lost virulence for ferrets but retained its immunizing property for dogs. Rockborn (1958) adapted a strain of canine distemper virus to cell culture, and this method is now widely used to produce attenuated live-virus vaccines."", ""Rinderpest Virus"": ""Rinderpest is an acute highly contagious disease of ruminants characterized by erosions and necrosis of the intestinal mucosa. The disease is epizootic in parts of Africa and Asia, causing great losses of cattle and buffalo.Immunization.Koch in 1897 developed one of the first means of immunizing cattle against rinderpest by administering bile from infected cattle. Animals that survived were permanently immune. Formalin-and chloroform-inactivated vaccines were developed using tissues from infected animals. These vaccines were safe, but required two or three doses and protection lasted less than a year (Walker et al., 1946) . Rinderpest virus has been adapted to several foreign hosts, including goats (Daubney, 1949) and rabbits (Nakamura et al., 1938) and has been attenuated by passage in these animals. Tissues of these animals have been used to produce vaccines in many countries. However, on continued passage, the seed strains tend to lose their immunogenicity, and vaccines become contaminated with adventitious agents from the foreign host.The Kabete strain of rinderpest virus was adapted to grow on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated eggs, becoming attenuated for cattle after 19 passages . This vaccine and another containing a lapinized strain of virus adapted to embryonated eggs have been used widely in Africa (Nakamura and Miyamoto, 1953) . More recently, the Kabete strain was adapted to bovine kidney cell culture and after 70 passages became avirulent for cattle. This vaccine strain is safe and efficacious in most cattle breeds (Plowright and Ferris, 1962) . Protection persists for at least 4 years. Over 150 million doses of this vaccine have been used in Africa, with good success (Maurer, 1980) ."", ""Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)"": ""Bovine RSV produces a rhinitis and catarrhal bronchiolitis in cattle (Mohanty et al., 1975; Jacobs and Edington, 1975; Paccaud and Jacquier, 1970) . The virus appears to be widespread having been isolated in Europe, the United States, and Asia. Human and bovine virus are related antigenically (Paccaud and Jacquier, 1970) ; however, the cattle virus is not known to infect man.Immunization. Nasal secretory antibody is protective but the disease may occur in the presence of serum antibody. An inactivated bovine RSV vaccine is combined with vaccines for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine virus diarrhea, and bovine parainfluenza components in a multivalent formulation. The efficacy of the RSV component in this formulation is unclear."", ""I. RHABDOVIRIDAE"": ""Of the viruses in the family Rhabdoviridae that cause disease in man and domestic animals, the most important is rabies virus. Others include vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV) and bovine emphemeral fever virus (BEFV). VSV occurs sporadically and epizootically, affecting horses, cattle and swine in the United States. There is a formalininactivated vaccine (Gearhart et al., 1987) , but it is used rarely. BEFV is an arthropod-transmitted disease of cattle occurring mainly in Africa, but also in Asia and Australia; it is controlled by immunization with attenuated live-virus vaccines (Van der Westhuizen, 1967; Inaba et al, 1973; Spradbrow, 1977; Theodoridis et al, 1973) ."", ""Rabies Virus"": ""Rabies is an infection of the central nervous system; the disease can occur in most mammals and is usually fatal. There are only a few documented cases of human survivors. After isolating the virus, Pasteur (1881) developed a vaccine for its control. Historically rabies virus has been considered as a single serotype. But now shared antigens have been found in other viruses in Africa of which two, Mokola and Duvenhage, may be associated with human disease (Shope et al. y 1970) . Mokola virus causes a rabies-like disease in dogs and cats in Zimbabwe (Foggin, 1983) .Immunization.Protection against rabies correlates with SN antibody, which can be assessed by a number of tests. Pasteur's classical vaccine, developed from infected spinal cord tissue dried at room temprerature for 3-14 days, was given in a series of 21-28 inoculations beginning with material dried the longest and progressing through material dried for only 3 days (Pasteur 1881) . Even though the last inoculum was virulent enough to cause rabies, the earlier inoculations conferred sufficient immunity to protect the recipients. This method of producing a vaccine was successful in most instances but caused the disease occasionally and was eventually replaced by chemically inactivated vaccines prepared from infected brain tissue. Although effective, these vaccines gave rise to undesirable side-effects because they contained a myelin-related encephalitogen present in brains from mature animals. Substitution of brain tissue from immature animals such as suckling mice, rats, and rabbits with their lesser myelin antigenic content greatly reduced these post-vaccination reactions.The adaptation of the Flury strain of rabies virus to growth in chick embryos led to the development of attenuated live-virus vaccines produced in this tissue (Leach and Johnson, 1940; Koprowski and Cox, 1948; Black, 1950, 1954) .The growth of rabies virus in tissue culture has further improved rabies vaccines (Kissling, 1958; Cabasso et al., 1965; Emery et al., 1968; Brown et al., 1967; Fenje, 1960; Abelseth, 1964 ). Yet, despite their benefits, the attenuated rabies vaccines occasionally caused rabies, particularly in cats. Therefore, suckling mouse brain and tissue culture again became the substrates of choice to produce inactivated rabies virus vaccines for animals. In humans the requirement for a safe substrate is more exacting than in animals. For this reason, duck embryos proved better than brain tissue to produce rabies virus (Peck et al., 1956) . After inactivation with \u00df-propriolactone (BPL), this virus was an improved product for humans, although the allergenic effects from duck embryo tissue still present a problem. Therefore the adaptation of the PM rabies virus strain to human diploid cells and inactivation with BPL (Wiktor et al., 1964) was a further improvement. This vaccine is less reactive and more effective for pre-and post-exposure use in humans than any other yet made (Bahmanyar et al., 1976) . A similar vaccine produced in BHK cells is also beneficial in animals."", ""J. RETROVIRIDAE"": ""Retroviruses have an RNA genome, a portion of which encodes the unique enzyme reverse transcriptase. This enzyme imparts to retroviruses the ability to make RNA-directed DNA copies of their genome, which can then act as a transposable element and can be integrated into the host cell DNA. Thus, once a cell is infected, it may escape immune surveillance and destruction and the host animal may be infected for life. The retroviruses thus constitute a considerable challenge to traditional vaccine approaches, as discussed further in the chapters by Arlinghaus and by Nathanson and Gonzalez-Scarano.Many retroviruses infect mammalian species, from mouse to man. Most notable are the C-type retroviruses, including the primate, murine, and feline leukemia viruses, as well as human T-cell leukemia viruses types I and II; the B-type retroviruses, particularly mouse mammary tumor virus; and the lentiviruses, including caprine infectious anemia virus, Visna virus, equine infectious anemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, bovine immunodeficiency virus, and human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2).In recent years, as HIV has become a major threat, massive efforts have been directed to developing an efficacious vaccine. So far, all attempts have met with failure. In fact, there are only two retrovirus vaccines that have been proven effective: a formalin-inactivated whole virus preparation of the primate SAIDS type D retrovirus, which is capable of protecting monkeys from a lethal challenge (Marx et al., 1986) , and the commercially available vaccine for feline leukemia."", ""Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV)"": ""FeLV commonly infects cats in urban areas, usually by the oralnasal route. Kittens under 6 months of age are particularly susceptible. About 1% of infected cats develop persistent anemia from which myeloproliferative disease and hypoplastic anemia may follow. The immunosuppression caused by FeLV infection may predispose to severe chronic opportunistic infections. Because cats that develop neutralizing antibody are usually immune to infection, vaccines have been developed and tested with that goal in mind.Immunization.The problem in developing a vaccine for feline leukemia was to find immunogens that could be used without exposing animals to oncogenic materials. Early studies with inactivated whole virus were unsuccessful (Yohn et al., 1976) . Although attenuated live-virus vaccines induce sufficiently high levels of neutralizing antibodies to be protective ( Jarrett et al., 1974; Pedersen et al., 1979) , their oncogenic potential makes them unacceptable. Efforts to develop vaccines containing only viral proteins, such as envelope protein, have had variable results. However, cultivation of FeLV in FL 74transformed cells, followed by treatment to release viral and cell proteins, yields a vaccine that stimulates antibodies to both viral and cell membrane components. A commercial vaccine using this method of antigen production has been approved for use in the United States; it is based on studies done by Olsen and Lewis (1981) . Subsequently, the efficacy of this vaccine has been disputed (Pederson and Ott, 1985) ."", ""\u039a. CORONAVIRIDAE"": ""Viruses in the family Coronaviridae cause important diseases including avian infectious bronchitis, transmissible gastroenteritis of swine (TGE), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), and human Coronavirus infections. Other coronaviruses may cause disease in calves, dogs, mice, rats, turkeys, horses, and parrots, but the diseases are of less importance. Coronavirus diseases usually follow a similar pattern, except for FIP. FIP is a chronic debilitating disease manifested as fibrinous peritonitis and pleuritis. The infection may be inapparent, but is fatal in a small proportion of infected cats. The immune response to FIP virus seems to mediate the disease; the immune response is not protective and antibody levels are higher in diseased animals. Immune complexes have also been demonstrated in renal glomeruli of cats with FIP.Bovine Coronavirus causes acute diarrheal disease in neonatal calves (Mebus et al., 1973 ). An attenuated live-virus vaccine is being used in combination with an attenuated live-virus rotavirus vaccine to control calf diarrhea. The vaccine is administered to pregnant cows near the end of gestation and stimulates colostral antibodies that offer protection to nursing calves.With the exception of avian infectious bronchitis, most Coronavirus infections have been difficult to control with vaccines. Perhaps this is because primary lesions are in mucous membranes of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, sequestered from immune reactivity. Coronaviruses produce about 15% of common colds in man, second only to rhino viruses. There are two groups of human coronaviruses that are antigenically distinct."", ""Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV)"": ""IBV is a highly contagious respiratory infection of young chickens. The virus may also infect older birds, causing a decrease in egg production. The disease was first shown to be caused by a virus by Bushnell and Brandley (1933) . Beaudette and Hudson (1937) propagated the virus in chick embryos, making possible the quantification of the virus and the means for attenuation. There are a number of serotypes of IBV, making the development of an effective vaccine difficult.Immunization. Immunity following natural infection may last up to 1 year, depending on the serotype and the severity of challenge. Van Roekel et al. (1950) first developed an immunization procedure; he used a field strain of virus to infect 7-to 15-week-old birds before they start to lay, inoculating a few of the birds and allowing infection to spread naturally through the flock. Today, there are a number of attenuated live-virus vaccines licensed in the United States. There is good protection (90-100%) against homologous virus strains and about 40% against heterologous strains (Hofstad, 1981) . Reduced pathogenicity may be associated with reduced immunogenicity, so a balance must be maintained. The attenuated live-virus vaccines are administered by the usual labor-saving devices of spraying, dusting, or placing the vaccine in drinking water. The wide-scale use of IBV vaccines has significantly reduced the economic loss caused by this disease."", ""Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGE)"": ""TGE is an often fatal disease of pigs under 2 weeks of age. The main lesion is enteritis, resulting in malabsorption, diarrhea, and dehydration. TGE virus is serologically related to FIP virus, but the diseases have entirely different characteristics. There is one serotype of TGE virus and one serotype of FIP virus.High levels of maternal TGE antibody in sows' colostrum protect piglets if fed continuously. Immunity of this type has been produced by feeding sows tissues containing virulent TGE virus several weeks prior to gestation. The effects of this virus are relatively mild in older animals."", ""A. Corynebacterium"": ""The genus Corynebacterium is a heterogeneous grouping with its species placed together largely on the basis of similar cell wall components (Goodfellow and Minnikin, 1981) . These species share a basic cell wall chemistry (Barksdale, 1981) of which the mycolic acids (Silva and Ioneda, 1977) , especially trehalose dimycolate, are frequently used as potent adjuvants in immunization protocols.Two corynebacteria-C. pyogenes and C. pseudotuberculosis-are important in veterinary medicine. The former is frequently associated with ruminate suppurative conditions and abscesses, but it rarely affects man. Infections with this organism are sporadic, because it is an opportunist that gains entry through wounds and abrasions. It may also be seen as a secondary invader in devitalized tissues; e.g., vaccination site abscesses. The efficacy of vaccines, toxoids, and antisera against C. pyogenes is equivocal; little is known about immunity to the bacterium."", ""Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis"": ""Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis causes caseous lymphadenitis of goats and sheep. It is recognized as a worldwide problem and a serious cause of economic loss to the goat industry (Burrell, 1981; Ashfaq and Campbell, 1980) . As with C. pyogenes, the responsible bacterium, C. pseudotuberculosis, is primarily an opportunist entering wounds or abrasions, where it causes local inflammation before settling in the regional lymph nodes.Immunization.Cell-mediated immunity is necessary for acquired resistance and protection against C. pseudotuberculosis (Jolly, 1965; Tashjian and Campbell, 1983; Irwin and Knight, 1975) . Killed and autogenous vaccines and a toxoid vaccine have been used in attempts to immunize against the bacterium (Cameron, 1972; Brogden et al., 1984; Nairn et al., 1977; Burrell, 1978; Anderson and Nairn, 1984; Brown et al., 1986) ; however no one vaccine has proven highly efficacious."", ""Corynebacterium diphtheriae"": ""Diphtheria, characterized by the formation of a tightly adherent pseudomembrane on the pharyngeal mucous membranes of the throat and trachea, is a highly contagious disease of man caused by the bacterium C. diphtheriae. The bacterium can also be isolated from the pharyngeal mucosa of normal individuals. The organism produces a lethal protein exotoxin (Gill and Pappenheimer, 1971; Collier and Kandel, 1971) .Immunization.Successful immunization against C. diphtheriae actually protects against the diphtherial exotoxin. Because diphtheria toxin is produced in high yield by the Park-Williams Number 8 strain (PW8), PW8 is used to make diphtherial toxoid for vaccines. As a source of toxin it is rendered nontoxic by incubation with formalin under alkaline conditions. The product's retention of antigenicity, enabling it to induce antitoxin antibodies, makes it an excellent pediatric vaccine. It is commonly utilized in combination with antigens from C. tetani and B. pertussis."", ""B. Bacillus"": ""The most important species of the Bacillus genus, B. anthracis, is the organism responsible for the disease anthrax in both man and animals. Anthrax was the first bacterial disease ever to be reported, being described by Davaine in 1863. Koch in 1876 reproduced the disease via animal inoculation and in 1881 Pasteur successfully vaccinated against anthrax. In animals, natural infection usually occurs by ingestion of spores that germinate in the mucosa of the esophagus or the intestinal tract. Herbivorous animals, especially cattle, horses, sheep, and goats, are highly susceptible to the disease, usually the result of grazing in infected pastures or consuming infected foods.In man, anthrax is manifested in three forms: cutaneous (malignant carbuncle), pulmonary (woolsorter's disease), and gastrointestinal with cutaneous being the most common. Death results from the combined effects of an extracellular toxic protein complex (Vodkin and Leppla, 1983) comprised of three components: edema factor, protective antigen, and lethal factor (Leppla, 1982; Stephen, 1981) . Effective vaccines require all three components.Immunization.The attenuated Pasteur vaccine has been supplanted in veterinary medicine by stable spore vaccines, carbo-zoo vaccine, or Stern vaccine (Jackson et al., 1957) prepared from avirulent, nonencapsulated variants of B. anthracis. The viable bacterial spores are suspended in 10% saponin. Immunity is attributed to the development of antibodies to the toxins released from growing bacteria. Vaccines of killed bacteria provide little immunity, since no bacterial toxins are produced; hence, no antitoxin antibodies are generated. Purified protective antigen (complex toxin) is both antigenic and immunogenic and has been used as a vaccine for humans. It is prepared by aluminum potassium sulfate precipitation of sterile B. anthracis culture filtrates and has proven highly efficacious."", ""C. Erysipelothrix"": ""Erysipelothrix is found in soil, water, and decaying vegetative material and carcasses. The major species of interest is E. rhusiopathiae, which has 20 serotypes (Norrung, 1979) . The bacterium, most notable for causing swine erysipelas, is capable of invading the tissues of both man and animal. Fatally affected animals develop welt-like, discolored cutaneous lesions, and numerous hemorrhagic lesions in thoracic and abominai viscera; chronic debilitating arthritis predominates in surviving animals.Immunization.The principal vaccines used to control erysipelas are formalin-killed, alum-adsorbed, whole-cell culture vaccines. These combinations of soluble bacterial glycoprotein and whole killed bacterial cells are usually produced from strains of serotype 2, which possess highly antigenic soluble cell wall glycoproteins. Animals immunized with cell-free culture fluids develop agglutinins to the whole bacteria (White and Verway, 1970) . Such vaccines are highly effective in controlling swine erysipelas."", ""D. Clostridium"": ""The pathogenic Clostridia invade both man and many animal species of veterinary interest, in which they cause such diseases as tetanus (C. tetani), gas gangrene (C. perfringens, C. septicum, C. oedematous), botulism (C. botulinum), enterotoxemia, and dysentery (C. perfringens). The Clostridia are widely distributed in soil and water and are common inhabitants of the intestinal tracts of animals and humans. Additionally, the bacteria can often be isolated from infected wounds. Vaccination is not routinely practiced against all clostridial organisms, notably C. botulinum. The toxins of C. botulinum, which exert their effects upon the nervous system (Schantz and Sugiyama, 1974) , are as potent as those of C. tetani. The lethal dose of the toxin, however, is less than that required to induce an antibody response."", ""Clostridium perfringens"": ""Clostridium perfringens has five serotypes, A-E, classified according to the production of lethal exotoxins. Types A and C are pathogenic for man, whereas all five serotypes can affect animals (see Table I ).Immunization.The exotoxins of C. perfringens are antigenic proteins that can be detoxified for use in vaccines. The existence of common capsular antigens, which elicit cross-reactions between the serotypes, demonstrates the considerable heterogeneity of this group. Ewes and lambs are frequently vaccinated against C. perfringens enterotoxemias. Effective vaccines employ type-specific alum- precipitation or formalinized toxoids (Smith and Matsuoka, 1959; Kennedy et al, 1977) ."", ""Clostridium tetani"": ""Clostridium tetani elaborates potent neurotropic exotoxins (tetanospasmin and tetanolysin) that may be lethal for susceptible species such as man, horses, mules, swine, cattle, and sheep. Birds are not naturally susceptible to the bacterium. Tetanus toxin is one of the most poisonous toxins known. It acts only on the nervous system and its effect characteristically causes spastic paralysis and generalized convulsions.Immunization.Protective antitoxin blood levels are obtained by immunizing both humans and susceptible animals with alumprecipitated or absorbed tetanus toxoid (Chodnik et al., 1959) . Ramon and Lemetayer (1931) first introduced the concept of active immunization against tetanus when they used formalinized tetanus toxoid precipitated with alum to vaccinate horses. Clostridium tetani vaccines are very effective at inducing long-lasting immunity in both man and domestic animal species. A serious, often fatal disease has been successfully controlled with these vaccines."", ""Clostridium novyi"": ""Clostridium novyi possesses four antigenic types, A, B, C, and D; type A is the most common clinical pathogen. Types A and \u0392 are responsible for gas gangrene both in man and animals (Elder and Miles, 1957) . In areas where sheep simultaneously carry a heavy liver-fluke infestation, exposure to C. novyi is often associated wtih hepatic necrosis and subcutaneous edema. Migrating flukes produce foci of hepatic necrosis suitable for the germination of spores and the subsequent elaboration of lethal toxins (Williams, 1962) .Immunization.Effective vaccinations for C. novyi in animals employ chemically inactivated, detoxified, and adjuvanted suspensions of alum-precipitated formalinized whole broth cultures."", ""Clostridium chauvoei"": ""Clostridium chauvoei, which is the etiologic agent for the disease \""blackleg\"" and is pathogenic for animals only, occurs primarily in ruminant species. Protective antigens and toxins with hemolytic and necrotizing activity are formed in susceptible animals ( Jayaraman et al., 1962) . The necrotizing toxin may effect fatal toxemia with degenerative foci of myonecrosis.Immunization. Immunity to C. chauvoei can be produced via vaccination with its alum-precipitated formalinized cultures (Chandler and Gulasekhuram, 1970) ."", ""Clostridium septicum"": ""Clostridium septicum, in contrast to C. chauvoei, is pathogenic for both man and animal. In man, it is associated with gas gangrene and in affected animals, primarily ruminants, it is the agent most closely identified with the diseases malignant edema and braxy. The organism produces four lethal necrotizing, hemolyzing toxins that cause an increase in capillary permeability and myonecrosis.Immunization. Immunity to C. septicum is induced with injection of formalinized bacterial cultures. The antitoxin provides homologous protection and additionally protects against C. chauvoei. Animals are often vaccinated with mixtures of Clostridial species; i.e., novyi, chauvoei, septicum, perfringens, and sordelli in one combination vaccine. These are highly efficacious vaccines and are routinely used in veterinary medicine."", ""E. Mycobacterium"": ""Although infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis primarily occur through inhalation of the tubercle bacillus, ingestion of large numbers of the bacilli in contaminated milk or infectious sputum can readily produce disease in susceptible species. The bacterium is pathogenic in man, but can also cause disease in monkeys, pigs, and occasionally in cattle, dogs, and parrots. The disease may be asymptomatic or produce severe, debilitating pulmonary lesions. If infection is not restricted by the immune system, the disease may be fatal (Comstock, 1982; Bloom and Godal, 1983) . Since bacteriocidal mechanisms of the normal macrophage prevent M. tuberculosis from multiplying intercellularly (Goren, 1977; Goren et al., 1976) , protective immunity depends on cell-mediated immunity (Lagrange, 1984) .Mycobacterium bovis, closely related to M. tuberculosis, and M. avium causes disease primarily in cattle and birds. They can, however, be contagious to man, sheep, and pigs.Immunization.Immunoprophylaxis for tuberculosis is based on vaccination with an attenuated, relatively avirulent strain of M. bovis that does not produce lesions. The strain is known as BCG or the bacillus of Gu\u00e9rin (1924, 1926) . Worldwide, this is one of the most widely used human vaccines, as it has proven efficacious in controlling a severe disease. Additionally, BCG has been used for nonspecific enhancement of resistance against tumors and other infec-tions. The cell wall of M. tuberculosis is a potent immunostimulant when used in Freund's adjuvant."", ""F. Streptococcus"": ""Although streptococci may be normal inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract, they may also be pathogenic for both man and animals. On the basis of characteristic cell wall components, the streptococci are traditionally divided into Lancefield groupings (Lancefield, 1934) ."", ""Streptococcus agalactiae"": ""Streptococcus agalactiae, a streptococcus group \u0392 organism, causes severe mastitis in the bovine species and has been identified as a major cause of serious neonatal infections in man (Eickoff et al., 1964) . Capsular antigens form the four major type-specific antigens (la, lb, II, and III), with type III organisms being most commonly associated with neonatal meningitis. In infants, early-onset disease occurs within the first days of life and is characterized by sepsis and pneumonia. The mortality rate is high. Late-onset disease occurs around 1 month of age and is characterized by meningitis (Einstein et al., 1982) .Immunization.There is a direct correlation between the absence of maternal IgG antibody to type III antigen and the incidence of neonatal infection. Thus, susceptibility to the bacterium is related to the absence of significant levels of maternal serum antibody being transferred transplacental^ to the fetus. Current vaccine developments are directed toward maternal immunization with type III antigen (Einstein et al., 1982) ."", ""Streptococcus pneumoniae"": ""Streptococcus pneumoniae, the etiologic agent of pneumococcal pneumonia in human infants and adults, may cause septicemia, meningitis, and inner ear infections. Aerosol transmission of the bacterium, often in association with viral upper respiratory infections, is the major mode of transmitting S. pneumoniae infections. Streptococcus pneumoniae possesses a capsular polysaccharide capable of deterring phagocytosis, thus enhancing the virulence of the bacterium. Of over 80 types of the bacterium identified, 10 serotypes are most frequently associated with the disease."", ""Escherichia coli"": ""Enterotoxigenic pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli may cause severe, potentially fatal, diarrheal disease in both man and domestic species, particularly neonatal cattle and swine. The capsular (K) antigens are cell-surface proteins and/or polysaccharides associated with virulence. The K88 antigen mediates adhesion to the microvillus of intestinal epithelial cells; production and release of enterotoxin follow (Bywater, 1970; Lonroth et al., 1979) . Escherichia coli neonatal enteritis of newborn calves is also a serotype-specific disease (Myers and Guin\u00e9e, 1976) . Ail important colostral antibodies in both swine and cattle are anti-K antibodies (usually K99) (Myers and Guin\u00e9e, 1976; Moon et ah, 1978) .Immunization.Vaccination of gilts, sows, heifers, and cows with vaccines prepared from the K88 or other pilus-associated antigens has reduced morbidity and mortality from E. coli nec natal enteritis of newborn piglets and calves (Nagy et ah, 1978; Rutter, 1975; Kohler et ah, 1975; Childrow and Porter, 1979; Myers and Guin\u00e9e, 1976) . To prepare the porcine vaccines, bacterial strains specific for the herds to be vaccinated are used to immunize animals 3 weeks prior to parturition, thereby generating specific, protective colostral antibodies. Recombinant DNA technology, discussed in the chapter by Collett has introduced the potential to construct E. coli vaccine strains that would afford considerably better protection than those currently available."", ""Salmonella spp."": ""Salmonella species are a major cause of invasive enteric infections in humans and domestic animals, with domestic poultry constituting the largest reservoir of Salmonella organisms in nature. Normally, infection occurs through the oral route. Salmonella is a facultative intracellular pathogen; therefore, cell-mediated immunity is more important than humoral immunity in resistance to the disease, salmonellosis (Fields et ah, 1986a,b; Dougan et ah, 1987; Woolcock, 1973) .Salmonella typhi, the only Salmonella species that has a capsular polysaccharide (Vi antigen), is the etiologic agent of typhoid fever, a serious and common disease in underdeveloped areas (Edelman and Levine, 1986) . This pathogen infects humans only; there is no suitable animal model for typhoid fever.Immunization. Few vaccines have been developed for Salmonella, and most are of low efficacy with undesirable side-effects. Live vaccines are more effective than killed ones in promoting better immunity (Levine et ah, 1983; Dougan et ah, 1987; Roantree, 1967) . With respect to S. typhi, vaccines containing the inactivated bacteria offer only limited and transient protection with undesirable side-effects (Levine, et ah, 1983) . The attenuated strain of S. typhi, Ty-21a, requires multiple doses to achieve 60-70% protection (Hirschel et ah, 1985) . Consequently, typhoid fever has not been controlled by immunization, although the Vi antigen has recently been hailed as the agent of a preventative vaccine (Robbins and Robbins, 1984) without adverse side-effects (Acharya et ah, 1987) ."", ""Yersinia pestis"": ""Yersinia pestis is the etiologic agent of plague or \""black death\"" in man, a highly fatal disease with fever and purulent lymphadenopathy.Although not a disease of domestic animals, rats, ground squirrels, and other rodents may be affected. The bacterium is spread by the rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, from rat to rat and from rat to man.Immunization.The most widely used vaccine for the prevention of Y. pestis infection is Haffkine's vaccine, first developed in 1897. This vaccine is prepared from heat and phenol-killed virulent cultures. Formalin-killed virulent bacteria are also successful, as are living avirulent strains (Grasset, 1946) . The is no evidence that any vaccine protects against pneumonic plague, the most contagious and fatal form of the disease.

Killed P. multocida vaccines are prepared from virulent immunogenic strains of the bacterium. The organisms are suspended in formalinized saline, incorporated into an adjuvant, and injected subcutaneously (Heddleston et al., 1974) . These vaccines induce substantial immunity to fowl cholera. Additionally, live vaccines for oral administration have been developed for use in the poultry industry (Dougherty et al., 1955; Heddleston et al., 1974; Oison, 1977; Bierer and Derieux, 1972) .Pasteurella multocida is usually mixed with modified live or killed bovine rhinotracheitis virus, parainfluenza 3 virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, and P. hemolytica bacteria in combination vaccines to protect against Pasteurella pneumonia in cattle."", ""Pasteurella haemolytica"": ""Bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis (shipping fever) is a severe fibrinous pneumonia of feedlot cattle usually associated with biotype A, serotype 1 infections with this organism.Immunization.

Humoral antibody responses appear to correlate strongly with protection against experimental disease (Confer etat., 1985; McKinney et al., 1985) .

Hemophilus pleuropneumoniae possesses major and minor antigens that are both common and serotype specific (Gunnarson et al., 1978; Gunnarson, 1979; Mittal et al., 1982) .

The primary source of infection is infected animals, whose mammary and/or genital secretions may contain the bacterium. Calves can become infected in utero; however, the main portals of infection are oral mucosa, nasopharynx, and conjuctiva of exposed animals. Immunity to B. abortus is dependent upon cell-mediated immunity, as the presence of serum antibodies, although a significant indicator of infection, does not correlate with the immune status of the host (Fitzgeorge et al., 1967; Kaneene, et al., 1978; Swiderska et al., 1971; Montaraz and Winter, 1986) ."", ""Brucella melitensis"": ""Most humans who contract brucellosis have been exposed either to B. melitensis, the etiologic agent of Malta or Mediterranean fever, or B. abortus.

This is a viable, smooth strain that, while posing virtually no threat for cattle, may cause disease in man. The major objections to the vaccine are this pathogenicity for humans and the difficulty of differentiating vaccinated from naturally infected animals since persistent serum antibodies are induced by the vaccine. Killed B. melitensis in adjuvant or live avirulent strains have been used for vaccines to induce a high degree of immunity in sheep and goats.

Vibrio"": ""The most important organism of this genus, V. cholera, causes severe, acute enteritis in humans and nonhuman primates."", ""Virbrio cholera"": ""The etiologic agent of cholera in humans, V. cholera, causes a potentially fatal diarrheal disease. Infection results in the production of a powerful enterotoxin in the small intestine, which stimulates an increase in cyclic AMP in intestinal epithelial cells and causes a profuse outpouring of isotonic fluids. Vibrio possesses immunogenic heat-labile flagellar (H) protein and heat-stable (O) lipopolysaccharide somatic antigens. The cholera toxin is immunologically and functionally similar to the heat-labile enterotoxin of E. coli (Yamamoto et al., 1984) . It consists of six light subunits (L) that assist in toxin adherence to intestinal cell receptors and one heavy subunit (H), which is the toxic entity.Immunization. Present cholera vaccines are administered by parenteral or oral routes. Parenteral vaccines consist of formalin/phenolinactivated bacteria, whereas oral vaccines employ killed or live bacteria. Vaccines given by either route provide protection for approximately 3-9 months. The predominant immune mechanism is antibacterial rather than antitoxic (Levine et al., 1979) ; antibacterial antibodies prevent attachment of the bacterium, whereas antitoxic antibodies inhibit toxin adherence to cell receptors. Because current vaccines often produce adverse side-effects (Feeley, 1970) , synthetic and semi-synthetic vaccines are currently under investigation. For the latter, a nonpyrogenic, bivalent cell-surface protein-polysaccharide conjugate is being investigated (Kabir, 1986) .H. Leptospira spp.The pathogenic genera of this family can penetrate the gastrointestinal mucosa and abraded epidermis. Leptospires are transmitted through contact with the urine of animal carriers, either directly or in contaminated water or soil. Rodents are the primary reservoir of the bacteria which, due to its ability to synthesize urease, colonizes the renal nephron and subsequently is shed into the urine. Leptospirosis causes economically serious disease in cattle and swine by causing fetal death, abortion, and infertility. Recovery from infection with one serotype lends immunity only to that serotype. This immunity is predominantly humoral, since agglutinins (IgM) are responsible for the initial clearance of the bacteria; neutralizing antibodies (IgG) are also protective (Hanson, 1974; Negi et al., 1971) . Canine leptospirosis infections may be severe, occurring more commonly in male dogs than in females. Man is a dead-end host for leptospires; infection in man is accidental and usually related to occupational exposure.Immunization. Killed, multivalent, leprospira vaccines protect against clinical disease in cattle and swine; however, in pigs, immunity does not protect against renal colonization (Stalheim, 1968) . Dogs can be vaccinated successfully with formalin or phenol-killed vaccines that contain antigens from the two most common infecting serotypes, L. canicola and L. icterohemorrhagica (Kerr and Marshall, 1974) .

Vaccine against Rinderpest Virus was developed by Koch in 1897 by administering bile from infected cattle. Animals that survived were permanently immune. Formalin- and chloroform-inactivated vaccines were developed using tissues from the infected animals. For the control of Newcastle disease, a number of attenuated live-virus vaccines have been developed which are widely used to control the disease. The Bl strain, the LaSota strain, and the F strain are used to immunize birds of all ages by different routes, including by addition to drinking water and by spraying. Protection against rabies correlates with SN antibody, which can be assessed by a number of tests.

Aside from rhinovirus infection, which has been shown to occur following contact of the nasal and conjunctival mucosa with fingertips seeded with virus, (1) the evidence for the hand contact route is indirect albeit substantial. Intervention studies conducted in senior daycare facilities, (2) student dormitories, (3) military barracks, (4) and households (5) have shown that increased handwashing and/or hand treatment with an iodine solution decreased respiratory tract illnesses by 20% or more relative to the incidence in control groups. A meta-analysis of eight selected intervention studies geared toward the general public showed a 24% decrease in respiratory illness relative to control groups due to handwashing measures. (6) Given these overall findings, recent pandemic influenza planning documents identify hand contact as a potential exposure route, (7) even though this pathway never has been experimentally demonstrated for seasonal influenza A virus.The risk of respiratory tract infection due to hand touches to target facial membranes (the conjunctivae of the eyes, the lips, the mucous membranes of the nostrils) depends, in part, on the rate of contact (number per unit time) with these targets. Other risk factors include the rate of hand contact with environmental surfaces, the degree of contamination of the touched surfaces, the transfer efficiency on touching, and the infectivity (virulence) of the pathogen. A reasonable qualitative statement is that infection risk increases as the rate of hand contact with target facial membranes increases. However, a more quantitative description is desirable. Because there are sparse published data concerning the rate of hand contact with target facial membranes, the authors conducted a limited observational study of that rate. The authors also developed a mathematical framework that uses hand contact rate information to estimate the pathogen dose to target facial membranes and relates this dose to infection risk."", ""METHODS"": ""T he authors conducted an observational study into which 10 student volunteers (5 women and 5 men) were recruited. Each subject sat alone at the same desk in the same small room, and performed office-type work (e.g., working on a laptop computer, reading, writing) for a continuous 3-hr period while being videotaped, with the subject's knowledge. The subjects understood that: (i) the tapes would be viewed by the investigators to count the number of touches to a variety of surfaces; and (ii) the tapes would be treated as confidential and kept in a locked cabinet in the office of one of the investigators (MN). Each subject was paid a small amount for participating. Subsequent to the 10 sessions, the same investigator (DB) viewed the tapes and counted the number of times each subject touched his/her eyes, nostrils, and lips. Descriptive statistics (the sample mean and standard deviation) were computed for the touch frequencies. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were computed for the three pairwise combinations of touch frequencies (lips-eyes, lips-nostrils, eyes-nostrils), and tests of the hypothesis that the rank correlation coefficients exceeded zero were performed. (8) The study design was reviewed and approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects, University of California, Berkeley.Development of the mathematical model for the transfer of pathogens to target facial membranes was based on traditional principles of mass (or number) balance and the assumption of first-order loss rates. A traditional one-hit dose-response function was slightly modified to relate the risk of infection to the pathogen dose delivered to target facial membranes."", ""RESULTS OF THE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY"": ""T he data collected were the number of contacts of the three target facial membranes by each of 10 subjects over a 3-hr period while the subjects worked alone at a desk. Table I lists the frequency of contacts with the eyes, nostrils and lips, and the sum of these counts. For the total counts per subject, the sample meanx = 47, the sample standard deviation s = 35, and the sample range is 3 to 104. The average total contact rate per hour is 15.7 (the average total frequency divided by 3). There is substantial interindividual variability in total hand contact rates with target facial membranes, as reflected by the 35-fold difference in the range limits (104 \u00f7 3) and by the 73% coefficient of variation, equal to 100% \u00d7 (35 \u00f7 47). There is also a positive intra-subject correlation between the number of hand contacts with lips and eyes and with lips and nostrils, which is to say that those who touch their lips frequently tend to touch their eyes and nostrils frequently. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients for contacts between different facial target sites are as follows: (i) 0.76 for the lips and eyes; (ii) 0.66 for the lips and nostrils; and (iii) 0.44 for the eyes and nostrils. Given the conventional hypothesis test error of alpha equal 0.05, the lips-eyes correlation coefficient of 0.76 is significantly greater than zero (one-sided p-value = 0.011), the lips-nostrils correlation coefficient of 0.66 is significantly greater than zero (one-sided p-value = 0.024), but the eyes-nostrils correlation coefficient of 0.44 is not significantly greater than zero (one-sided p-value = 0.093)."", ""THE EXPOSURE MODEL"": ""A model is presented that incorporates the hand contact rate and other factors that logically should influence the number of pathogens transferred to target facial membranes. It is advised that absent systematic experimental investigation, this exposure model must be viewed as providing a relatively crude first-pass estimate of the pathogen dose to target facial membranes.For a given pathogen of interest, let C surface (pathogens per cm 2 ) denote the average viable pathogen density on those environmental surfaces that can be touched by a person; substantial variability in pathogen density at different surface locations is expected. Note that in the microbial risk literature, a small inanimate object (for example, a cup or a doorknob) that can carry pathogens and transfer them to the hands upon contact is termed a \""fomite.\"" Because broad surfaces such as tabletops are not considered fomites but can transfer pathogens to the hands, the authors prefer to use the term \""environmental surface.\"" The average environmental surface area touched per hand contact is denoted A surface (cm 2 per contact). A fraction f 12 of the pathogens on the touched surface area are transferred to the hand. The subscript 12 denotes transfer from the environmental surface (1) to the hands (2). The rate of hand contact with environmental surfaces is H surface (contacts per minute). The rate of viable pathogens transfer to the hands (number of pathogens per minute) is:"", ""Rate of Transfer to the Hands"": ""At the same time, viable pathogens are lost from the hands due to die-off (inactivation), transfer back to touched surfaces, and transfer to target facial membranes. Pathogen die-off on the hands is reasonably modeled as exponential with a firstorder rate constant \u03b1 dieoff (fraction per minute), (9) such that the fraction of pathogens that die in a short time interval t is \u03b1 dieoff \u00d7 t. Let C hand (pathogens per cm 2 ) denote the viable pathogen density on the hands. Let A hand (cm 2 ) denote the contaminated hand surface area. Thus, the rate of viable pathogen die-off on the hands (number of pathogens per minute) is:The rate of viable pathogen transfer back to environmental surfaces (number of pathogens per minute) is the product of the rate of hand contact with environmental surfaces H surface , the viable pathogen density on the hands C hand , the hand surface area involved in a touch, and the fraction f 21 of the pathogens on the hand surface that are transferred to the environmental surface. The subscript 21 denotes transfer from the hand (2) to the environmental surface (1) . For simplicity, the authors assume that the same hand area always touches environmental surfaces, such that the hand surface area involved in a touch is the previous parameter A hand . Note that this equality is not a required assumption. The transfer rate back to environmental surfaces is:The rate of viable pathogen transfer to target facial membranes (number of pathogens per minute) is the product of the rate of hand contact with target facial membranes H face (contacts per minute), the viable pathogen density on the hands C hand , the hand surface area A hand involved in a touch, and the fraction f 23 of the pathogens on the hand surface that are transferred to the target membrane. The subscript 23 denotes transfer from the hand (2) to the target facial membranes (3). The transfer rate to target facial membranes is:"", ""Rate of Pathogen Transfer to Target Membranes"": ""In terms of the rate of change of the viable pathogen number on the contaminated hand surface, Eq. 1 is a gain term and Eqs. 2-4 are loss terms. The rate of gain minus the rate of loss leads to the following differential equation for the number of viable pathogens on the hand surface:For mathematical simplicity, the authors assume that the contaminated hand surface area A hand is equal to A surface , the environmental surface area touched per hand contact. In this case, dividing both sides of Eq. 5 by A hand cancels all the surface area terms. Note that equality between A hand and A surface is not a required assumption. Next, if the factors C surface , H surface , H face , \u03b1 dieoff , f 12 , f 21 and f 23 are treated as constants, then C hand is the only unknown term. For C hand = 0 at time zero, the solution equation for C hand as a function of time t (minutes) is as follows:where f 12 , f 21 and f 23 are fractions transferred per contact. For notational simplicity, let \u03bb decay = \u03b1 dieoff + H surface \u00d7 f 21 + H face \u00d7 f 23 , in which case Eq. 6 is written as:Next, consider that a person occupies a room or physical space with pathogen-contaminated surfaces for a continuous period of T minutes. The mean concentration of C hand over the interval [0, T] is:The expected dose D T of viable pathogens transferred to target facial membranes over the interval [0, T] is:In Eq. 9, if exposure duration T is much greater than the time scale for the pathogen loss rate from the hands (or T 1/\u03bb decay ), the steady-state solution to Eq. 7, equal to the quotient (H surface \u00d7 C surface \u00d7 A surface \u00d7 f 12 ) \u00f7 \u03bb decay , can be substituted for the time-averaged quantity C hand,T . Subsequent to time T when no viable pathogens are being added to the hands, the concentration C hand (T) will not suddenly go to zero (unless the hands are cleaned in some manner) but will exponentially decrease with the loss rate constant \u03bb decay . In turn, there will be an additional dose to target facial membranes during this decay phase. If the interval subsequent to time T is defined as [0, T decay ], the mean concentration of C hand over the interval is:In turn, the expected dose D Tdecay of viable pathogens transferred to target facial membranes over the interval [0, T decay ] is:The expected total dose D total is the sum of D T and D Tdecay . This construct is a simplified version of a more complex exposure model that accounts for variability in the value of C surface due to pathogen additions to the surface (e.g., from settled cough particles) and pathogen losses from the surface involving die-off, transfer to the hands, and possible suspension into air. (10) The more complex model also considers different types of environmental surfaces with different contact rates, and incorporates room ventilation information such that the inhaled dose of respirable pathogens can be estimated."", ""THE INFECTION RISK FUNCTION"": ""T he authors use a one-parameter exponential model that assumes that a single pathogen can infect the host with a probability denoted \u03b1. Let D tissue denote the expected number of pathogens that deposit at target tissue sites in the oro-and nasopharynx. If each pathogen acts independently to initiate infection, the risk of infection R is: (11) This model can account for variable host susceptibility by treating \u03b1 as variable across individuals, but the authors do not account for that circumstance because their emphasis is on exposure assessment and not the functional form of the risk equation. Note that the one-parameter exponential model is consistent with observed dose-infection response data for a variety of pathogenic viruses. (11) The parameter \u03b1 is related to the infectious dose 50% (ID 50 ) value by the expression: \u03b1 = ln(2) \u00f7 ID 50 , where ID 50 \u2265 ln (2) .The parameter \u03b1 is pathogen specific and may vary substantially across target tissue sites within the respiratory tract. For example, depending on the pathogen, \u03b1 might be much greater for deposition in the pulmonary region than for deposition in the pharyngeal region due to the density of receptor sites or host defense mechanisms. Evidence for such sitespecific differences would be the observation that to achieve infection of 50% of test subjects (or animals), inhalation of far fewer pathogens is required if the pathogens are carried on respirable particles compared with inspirable but nonrespirable particles. This circumstance must be considered because few if any pathogens deposited on target facial membranes will penetrate into the respiratory tract past the epiglottis; thus, using an \u03b1 estimate based on a respirable pathogen inhalation study may be inappropriate. A better study for estimating \u03b1 for a pathogen received by the hand contact route would involve instillation of the pathogen directly onto oro-and nasopharyngeal membranes.The latter idea segues to another consideration -the fraction of D total , the expected total number of pathogens depositing on target facial membranes, that reach oro-and nasopharyngeal target sites. Does D tissue = D total , or does D tissue = \u03b5 \u00d7 D total , where 0 < \u03b5 < 1? It is reasonable to believe that \u03b5 < 1, but the authors have seen no pertinent data. Therefore, perhaps the most appropriate study of infectivity for a pathogen received by the hand contact route would involve seeding the pathogen onto a target facial membrane, because infection response would inherently account for the fraction transported to oro-and nasopharyngeal target sites and for the \u03b1 value at those sites. The estimated \u03b1 value from such a study could be used in the equation: R = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03b1 \u00d7 D total ), where D total is the expected total dose to the target facial membranes."", ""A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE FOR EXPOSURE/RISK ASSESSMENT"": ""C onsider exposure to influenza A virus in a residential bedroom due to attending a sick family member (the infector). The duration of continuous exposure is T = 30 min, with a subsequent decay interval of T decay = 30 min. Posit that C surface = 28 TCID 50 cm \u22122 . The unit TCID 50 denotes the tissue culture infectious dose 50%, which is an operational quantity designating an unknown number of virus particles observed to infect 50% of replicate cell cultures each receiving the same volume of virus inoculum. It is likely that a TCID 50 unit corresponds to more than one virus particle. The C surface value is derived as follows.Virus-containing particles are emitted in coughs. Assume the infector coughs 12 times per hour (0.2 cough min \u22121 ), which is the approximate 40th percentile of the cough rates seen in pneumonia patients. (12) Emitted cough particles range in diameter from less than 1 \u03bcm to greater than 2,000 \u03bcm, but more than 99% of the aerosol volume (and presumably the emitted virus) is in large particles with diameters greater than 100 \u03bcm. (13) These large particles tend to settle rapidly onto room surfaces close to the point of emission. An estimated 0.044 mL of fluid (saliva) is emitted per cough. (13) Peak concentrations of influenza A virus in nasal fluid among a small panel of subjects were found to range from 6 \u00d7 10 2 to 2 \u00d7 10 7 TCID 50 mL \u22121 . (14) Consider a plausible concentration in saliva to be 1 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 mL \u22121 . Thus, the assumed virus deposition rate onto room surfaces is (0.2 cough min \u22121 ) \u00d7 (0.044 mL cough \u22121 )\u00d7 (1 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 mL \u22121 ) = 8.8 \u00d7 10 3 TCID 50 min \u22121 . If the infector is quiescent, virus is removed from room surfaces primarily by die-off due to environmental stress. Estimated first-order die-off rate constants for an influenza A strain were 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u22122 min \u22121 on pajamas and 2.0 \u00d7 10 \u22123 min \u22121 on stainless steel. (15) Assume a plausible value of 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22122 min \u22121 . Consider the area of particle settling to be a circle with radius 1 m around the infector, such that the contaminated surface area is 3.1 \u00d7 10 4 cm 2 . Thus, the average steady-state (constant) value C surface = (8.8 \u00d7 10 3 TCID 50 min \u22121 ) \u00f7 [(1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22122 min \u22121 )( 3.1 \u00d7 10 4 cm 2 )] = 28 TCID 50 cm \u22122 .The hand contact rate with environmental surfaces depends on the individual and the activities being performed, but a plausible value is H surface = 1 min \u22121 . The die-off rate on the hands appears to range from 4 \u00d7 10 \u22121 min \u22121 to 2 \u00d7 10 \u22122 min \u22121 . (15) Assume that \u03b1 dieoff = 1 \u00d7 10 \u22121 min \u22121 . The hand contact rate with target facial membranes also depends on the individual, but posit H face = 0.8 min \u22121 , which corresponds to the average total contact rate in Table I . The environmental surface area touched by the hand per contact, and the surface area of the hand that does the touching, are also variable and need not be equal. For simplicity, posit that A surface = 2 cm 2 , which is the approximate area of a finger tip.Virus transfer efficiency from a nonporous surface to a fingertip has been estimated to be 0.5% per touch per fingertip. (16, 17) The authors could not locate published data on virus transfer efficiency from a porous surface to a fingertip, but the transfer efficiency for bacteria from a porous surface has been estimated to be 0.1% per touch per fingertip. (16) For room surfaces in general, the authors posited that f 12 = 3 \u00d7 10 \u22123 (0.3%). Due to lack of data on microbial transfer efficiency from the hands to environmental surfaces, they assumed that f 21 = f 12 . The transfer efficiency of virus from a fingertip to the lips has been estimated to be 35% per touch. (18) It was assumed the same value for the eyes and nostrils such that f 23 = 3.5 \u00d7 10 \u22121 .At this point, all the input factors for computing C hand,T and C hand (T) have been specified and are summarized in Table II . Based on Eqs. 5 and 6, respectively, C hand (T) = 0.22 TCID 50 cm \u22122 and C hand,T = 0.20 TCID 50 cm \u22122 . Based on Eq. 8, C hand,Tdecay = 0.019 TCID 50 cm \u22122 . Based on Eqs. 7 and 8, respectively, D T = 3.4 TCID 50 and D Tdecay = 0.32 TCID 50 , such that the expected total dose D total is 3.7 TCID 50 . If there are multiple 30-min exposure periods followed by 30-min decay periods, and if the inputs remain the same across these periods, the total expected dose would be the corresponding multiple of 3.7 TCID 50 .Next, let \u03b5 = 0.5 (the midpoint of the 0 to 1 range), such that D tissue = 1.85 TCID 50 . Influenza A dose-infection response data from a nasal instillation study with human volunteers (19) was analyzed by the authors to estimate \u03b1. That analysis (to be reported elsewhere) yielded \u03b1 = 5.7 \u00d7 10 \u22125 per TCID 50 . Note that this estimate is subject to substantial uncertainty, because the pre-exposure antibody titers of the human subjects were unknown, and antibody titers are inversely related to the probability of developing clinical influenza. However, given \u03b1 = 5.7 \u00d7 10 \u22125 per TCID 50 , the estimated infection risk due to hand contact for a 30-min exposure period followed by a 30-min decay period is:An influenza infection risk of 0.011% does not seem substantial. On the other hand, there is substantial uncertainty in the value of \u03b1 for influenza A virus. If its value were 1000-fold greater than assumed here and if the D tissue value were unchanged, infection risk would be 10%. In addition, multiple exposure periods would increase the cumulative infection risk."", ""DISCUSSION"": ""T his investigation is apparently one of only two studies on the rate of hand contact with target facial membranes. In a 1973 study by Hendley et al., (1) a total of 124 adults seated either in an amphitheater or a Sunday school for periods of 30 to 50 min each, such that there were 89 person-hours of observation; in contrast, the present study involved 30 person-hours of observation. The Hendley study reported 29 episodes of nose-picking (0.33 hr \u22121 ) and 33 episodes of eye-rubbing (0.37 hr \u22121 ); the degree and duration of contact that qualified as nose-picking and eye-rubbing were not defined. These statistics are far lower than the rates are reported in Table I for, respectively, contacts with the nostrils (5.3 hr \u22121 ) and the eyes (2.5 hr \u22121 )."", ""the investigators observed"": ""Moreover, at least 50% of the nostril and eye touches that were observed could be classified as, respectively, nosepicking and eye-rubbing, although the authors rely on qualitative judgment for that classification. Assuming there was a true difference in the rates of nose-picking and eye-rubbing observed in the Hendley study and the present study, one reason might be that the present study subjects were alone and, thus, did not feel as socially inhibited as they would in a group setting. Beyond the issue of what constitutes nose-picking and eye-rubbing, the authors believe it is better to use the total contact rate with one or more target facial membranes to make an exposure estimate because pathogens could be transferred by both light and vigorous contact.A future refinement in exposure estimation might be to consider the rates of light vs. vigorous contacts, with a unique transfer efficiency associated with each type of contact. It is also reasonable to speculate that the contact rate depends on the type of activity being performed during the exposure period. For example, an activity requiring manual handling of objects might limit hand contact with the face.As previously stated, the exposure model must be viewed as providing a relatively crude first-pass estimate of the pathogen dose to target facial membranes. At the same time, the model incorporates factors that logically should influence pathogen transfer to target facial membranes, and identifies key information needs. In brief, quantitative data are needed concerning value ranges for: (i) pathogen concentrations on room surfaces; (ii) the rate of contact with potentially contaminated room surfaces; (iii) transfer efficiencies upon contact; and (iv) pathogen die-off rates on the hands. Information on pathogen die-off rates on environmental surfaces has recently been reviewed by Boone and Gerba. (9) With respect to infection risk, the authors do not assert that Eq. 12 is the single best risk model for all pathogens, although it is a reasonable construct to apply when the doseresponse data are sparse. An equally important issue is the value of the transport efficiency parameter \u03b5. It is plausible that \u03b5 could be close to zero or close to one depending on the tissue receptor sites for the pathogen and the target facial membrane. For example, if pathogen tissue receptors were primarily in the nasopharynx above the soft palate, it seems likely that few if any pathogens deposited on the lips would reach those receptors. On the other hand, if the tissue receptors were primarily in the oropharynx below the soft palate, perhaps the great majority of pathogens deposited on the lips would reach receptor sites.The field of quantitative microbial risk assessment is far less developed than that of toxic chemical risk assessment. Methods for determining the microbial quality of water and food have existed for decades, but descriptions of potential pathogen exposure have primarily been of a binary nature, that is, exposed vs. not exposed. Quantitative exposure assessments have been applied more recently to pathogens in water and food, but the hand contact exposure route has not been systematically investigated. It is hoped that the authors' observational data and hand contact exposure modeling will contribute to the future development of more rigorous microbial risk assessment tools."", ""ACKNOWLEDGMENTS"": ""T he authors thank Rachael Jones for her thoughtful review of the manuscript.

Thus, a key risk factor for infection transmission should be the rate of hand contact with these areas termed target facial membranes. A study was conducted in which 10 subjects were each videotaped for 3 hr while performing office-type work in isolation from other persons. The number of contacts to the eyes, nostrils, and lips was scored during subsequent viewing of the tapes. The total contacts per subject had sample mean x = 47 and sample standard deviation s = 34. The average total contact rate per hour was 15.7. The authors developed a relatively simple algebraic model for estimating the dose of pathogens transferred to target facial membranes during a defined exposure period. The model considers the rate of pathogen transfer to the hands via contact with contaminated environmental surfaces, and the rate of pathogen loss from the hands due to pathogen die-off and transfer from the hands to environmental surfaces and to target facial membranes during touching. The estimation of infection risk due to this dose also is discussed. A hypothetical but plausible example involving influenza A virus transmission is presented to illustrate the model.",10.1080/15459620802003896,PMC,PMC7196690,18357546.0,no-cc,2008-04-25,J Occup Environ Hyg,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196690/,2008.0,paper

A combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody type alone. Comparing ELISA to LFIA; both methods yielded high specificity reaching levels around 99%. ELISA performed better in terms of sensitivity (90-94%) followed by LFIA sensitivity ranging from 80% to 86% [8] . According to the manufacturer of the LFIA used in the current study, the sensitivity is 86.43% and the specificity is 99.57% using samples collected from 313 confirmed cases and 283 negative cases.The assay showed no cross reactivity with 17 viruses and mycoplasma including parainfluenza Seroprevalence studies can provide relevant information on the proportion of people who have experienced a recent or past infection.

The patient has recovered with antibiotics. The test was repeated for her after one month and the result was positive with no respiratory complications. Surprisingly, her husband tested negative for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that transmission of the virus between individuals may not be as straight forward as was indicated by normal human interaction.Interestingly, the first case confirmed positive in this study was tested on April 8, 2020, which is only 15 days after the first case was confirmed positive by NCDC on March 24, 2020 using rRT-PCR. This indicates that the virus has been widely spread among Libyan population way long before it was first detected by NCDC considering that the method of identification used by NCDC was to detect viral antigen, while our method was to detect antibodies against the virus, which naturally results after viral infection has occurred and lasts for months afterward.The high prevalence of COVID-19 (2.74%) identified by our study suggests that the viral infection amongst Libyan population is far higher than that identified by NCDC. If we were to apply the same analogy inferred by this study on the ~ 7 million Libyan population size, we would expect a close to 200,000 people infected by the virus, which is almost 3,000 times higher than the number of positive cases identified by NCDC.In conclusion, the preliminary investigation of SARS-CoV-2 revealed considerable prevalence in Alzintan City although the disease seems to be in its mild form. It is elusive that relatives of some COVID-19 rRT-PCR confirmed patients were negative in the cities of Tripoli, Misrata and Surman. Similarly, in the city of Alzintan, relatives of some confirmed positive patients have tested negative suggesting more complicated form of viral transmission than has previously outlined. Therefore, isolation, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Libya is strongly suggested.

ARV-encoded proteins, including at least 10 structural proteins and 4 non-structural proteins have been demonstrated (Varela and Benavente, 1994; Bodelon et al., 2001) . In the -class proteins of ARV, protein C, is a minor outer-capsid protein of ARV that is encoded by the largest open reading frame of the S1 segment (Varela and Benavente, 1994; Bodelon et al., 2001) . It is not only an attachment protein (Martinez-Costas et al., 1997) but also an apoptosis inducer . Some studies have suggested that C is the target for type-specific neutralizing antibodies while B is target for groupspecific antibodies (Wickramasinghe et al., 1993) . Protein P10 is a viroporin (Bodelon et al., 2002) responsible for ARV-induced cell fusion (Bodelon et al., 2001) . A recent report suggests that P17 retards cell growth by activation of P53 pathway . ARV A, encoded by the genome segment S2 (Yin et al., 2000) , has been identified as a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein (Yin et al., 2000) and is an inhibitor of the double-stranded RNAdependent protein kinas (Gonzalez-Lopez et al., 2003) . Another ARV protein, NS, encoded by the genome segment S4 (Chiu and Lee, 1997) , has been reported for its single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) binding activity (Yin and Lee, 1998) .The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a major intracellular protein degradation pathway in eukaryotic cells (Myung et al., 2001) , plays an important role in a wide variety of cellular functions, including signal transduction, antigen processing, cell cycle regulation, transcription regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis (Ciechanover, 1994; Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002) . In the present study, attempts were made to explore the role of proteasome inhibition in ARV infectivity and the mechanisms involved in the proteasome inhibitor suppression of ARV replication and apoptosis induction in cultured cells.It was shown previously that ARV C is an apoptosis inducer that causes apoptosis by linking Src kinase to p53-mitochondrial pathway in cultured cells Lin et al., 2006) . Using the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to inhibit the cellular proteasome pathway, it was found that MG132 could reduce ARV-induced apoptosis, cytopathic effect (CPE), virus titer, and protein expression. Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway did not affect viral entry and host cell translation. To our knowledge, this is the first finding demonstrating that ARV replication and ARV-induced apoptosis could be suppressed by MG132. "", ""Antibodies"": ""Two monoclonal antibodies against ARV A and NS were kindly provided by Dr. Long H. Lee (Hou et al., 2001; Pai et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2005) .

BHK-21 cells were pretreated with various concentrations of MG132 and then infected with ARV s1133 (MOI = 5) for 1 h.

To study the effect of MG132 on ARV replication and virus internalization, BHK-21 cells were infected with ARV at various MOIs or treated with various concentrations of MG132. Virus titers were determined at 18 h.p.i. by a plaque assay and Western blot for confirmation of expression of A, NS, and C proteins. Representative morphological changes of BHK-21 cells treated with MG132 or DMSO were observed by a phase-contrast microscopy at 18 h.p.i.To explore the effect of proteasome inactivation during the course of ARV infection, BHK-21 cells were treated with MG132 at different times. The cells were washed to remove the drug and further incubated until 18 h.

In addition, the construction of pcDNA-C has been described previously .To investigate the effect of MG132 on ARV production was through the reduction of ARV RNA levels, RNA extracted from BHK-21 cells 18 h.p.i. in the presence or absence of MG132 was amplified by RT-PCR.

Active caspase 3 in living cells was examined as described previously (Chulu et al., 2007) ."", ""Protease inhibitor MG132 reduces viral progeny release and ARV-induced CPE"": ""It was found that different doses of MG132 caused only slight cytotoxicity to BHK-21 cells (data not shown). ARV replication in untreated cells resulted in the generation of a viral titer of 10 7.5 PFU/ml after 18 h.p.i., wherease proteasome inhibition reduced the viral titer in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A) . The results indicated that the proteasome inhibitor significantly blocked ARV production, suggesting that the proteasome may play an important role in ARV replication. In this study, viral titers in the whole cell lysates harvested at 18 h.p.i. were reduced dramatically by MG132 (Fig. 1A) , suggesting that the effect is due to the reduction in virus growth rather than to a delay in virus release. Different amounts of input virus change the absolute amount of progeny virus but do not affect significantly the percentage of reduction in viral titers, suggesting that the antiviral properties of MG132 are independent of the multiplicity of infection (Fig. 1B) . In addition, ARV-induced CPE is characterized by cell fusion, detachment of infected cells from culture flask, cell lysis and death. ARV-induced CPE and cell death were reduced dramatically after the addition of MG132 (Fig. 1C) . Fig. 2A shows the experimental design for defining the major target of ubiquitin-proteasome system by following the MG132 treatment of ARV-infected cells at different time points in the viral life cycle. Fig. 2B shows that virus titer of the group treated for 0-6 h was 3.5 log units lower than the titer of the untreated sample. The virus titer of the groups treated for 6-12 h or 12-18 h was 2 and 0.5 log units lower than the titer of the non-treated sample. The kinetic study suggested that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved most likely at an early step in the virus life cycle, since the inhibitory effect of MG132 was seen primarily in the 0-6 h treatment group (Fig. 2B) ."", ""The ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in an early step of virus replication but does not block virus internalization"": ""As describe above, the MG132 has an inhibitory effect on ARV during early infection times. To dissect further each step in the presence of the MG132 to reveal the possible mechanism of inhibition, the virus internalization assay was carried out. There was no difference in virus titer in the presence or absence of MG132 (Fig. 2C ). Viral proteins A and NS are important for ARV replication while C is an apoptosis inducer. To determine whether the inhibitory effects of MG132 (25 uM) on ARV replication and apoptosis induc-tion depend on their activities, we also examined their expression levels in ARV-infected BHK-21 cells. The results indicated that the expression of A, C, and NS was reduced significantly in BHK-21cells either pre-incubated 30 min before infection or 2 h.p.i. with MG132 (Fig. 2D) , suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is not involved in virus internalization."", ""ARV transcription and protein expression were suppressed by MG132"": ""RT-PCR was carried out to investigate whether the effect of MG132 on ARV production was through the reduction in ARV RNA levels. The viral mRNA levels were dramatically decreased in ARVinfected BHK-21 cells treated with the MG132 (Fig. 3A) . The ARV life-cycle consists of several steps. To determine which step(s) in the virus life cycle, the MG132 targeted, the reduction of viral titers was tested from whole cell lysates treated with proteasome inhibitor either 30 min before virus infection or 2 h.p.i. The results showed that exposure to MG132 inhibited significantly viral protein production 2 h.p.i. (Fig. 2D) , suggesting that inhibition of viral replication by MG132 is likely not dependent on the blockage of viral entry into host cells.Cells positive for C expression were examined at 18 h.p.i. by IFA and Western blot assay in the presence of different concentrations of MG132. The MG132-treated cells showed significant reduction in amount of cells positive for ARV C expression (Fig. 3B ). In the present study, treatment with MG132 decreased C expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C) .The pcDNA-GFP construct was transfected into cells infected with different MOIs to understand whether MG132 can influence protein translation in BHK-21 cells. Fig. 3D shows that the expression of GFP protein was not affected but the expression of ARV C was suppressed in ARV-infected cells in the presence of various concentration of MG132. Taken together, the results suggested that proteasome inhibition decreased viral replication via suppression of protein translation."", ""The expression of ser 46 -phosphorylated p53 and active caspase 3 in ARV-infected BHK-21 cells was suppressed by MG132"": ""In this study, the level of ser 46 -phosphorylated p53 was reduced significantly in the presence of MG132 in either BHK-21 cells pre-incubated 30 min before infection or 2 h.p.i. with MG132 in ARV-infected BHK-21 cells (Fig. 4A) . In comparison to without MG132 or DMSO-treated groups, caspase 3 activated in ARVinfected BHK-21 cells treated with MG132 was reduced (Fig. 4B) . Addition of proteasome inhibitor in the medium also inhibited internucleosomal DNA cleavage, demonstrating that ARV-induced apoptosis could be suppressed by MG132 (Fig. 4C ). Fig. 4D shows that the transient expression of C was not affected in ARV-infected BHK-21 cells in the presence of various concentrations of MG132. This confirmed further that the MG132 could not affect host cell translation. It was also seen that the ele-vated level of ser 46 -phosphorylated p53 ( Fig. 4D ; upper panel) and apoptosis induction in BHK-21 cells (Fig. 4D ; lower panel) was due to ARV C expression. With the exception of mock-transfection with the plasmid pcDNA3.1 (\u2212), both ARV-infected cells without MG132 treatment and ARV C-transfected cells with MG132 treatment showed internucleosomal DNA cleavage ( Fig. 4D ; lower panel)."", ""Discussion"": ""The 26S proteasome is a large multi-subunit complex that degrades selectively intracellular proteins. It is involved in a wide variety of mediated proteolytically intracellular process, such as apoptosis, cell cycle progression, transcriptional control, and metabolic regulation (Hilt and Wolf, 2000) . Studies by many research groups have shown that various viruses have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to use or manipulate the host ubiquitinproteasome pathway for their own needs. Retroviruses require the proteasome for budding from cells (Schuber et al., 2000) , murine coronavirus for its transfer from endosome to cytoplasm during viral entry (Yu and Lai, 2005) , minute virus of virus (MVM) and reovirus for nuclear translocation (Connolly et al., 2000; Ros and Kempf, 2004) , and human cytomegalovirus for inducing cell cycle progression (Kalejta et al., 2003) . Adenovirus requires active proteasomes to promote late gene expression (Galinier et al., 2002) , Coxsackievirus for viral RNA transcription and protein synthesis (Luo et al., 2003) , and tobacco mosaic virus for degradation movement protein (Reichel and Beachy, 2000) . To date, whether the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway-mediated ARV replication and apoptosis induction is related to ubinquintin process or the proteasome degradation remains largely unknown. This study was therefore aimed at elucidating whether ARV also uses the ubiquitinproteasome pathway for it's own benefit and other mechanisms for cell regulation. In this study, various aspects of the ARV-proteasome interplay were characterized. A proteasome inhibitor MG132 was used to explore the effect of proteasome inhibition on ARV replication and apoptosis induction by ARV. It was observed that MG132 was fully active against ARV when present at the beginning of the infection and a very limited effect was observed when present later after infection, suggesting that inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome system did not affect virus entry and internalization and blocked ARV replication at an early step in viral life cycle.Infection with avian reovirus causes severe CPE and apoptosis in both avian and mammalian cells. During the past several years, it was demonstrated that ARV C could induce apoptosis in both culture cells and chicken tissues Lin et al., 2007) . Studies by our laboratory have demonstrated further that ARV-induced apoptosis by linking Src kinase to p53-mitochondrial pathway (Lin et al., 2006; Chulu et al., 2007) . A recent report demonstrated that p53 regulates bax expression and translocation into the mitochondria leading to cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm, activating the caspase pathway that finally leads to cell apoptosis (Chulu et al., 2007) . To date, the levels of ARV RNA transcription and protein synthesis in infected cells in the presence of MG132 were not clear. In the present study, the ARV RNA transcription and protein synthesis were shown to be inhibited dramatically in the ARV-infected cells after treatment with MG132. The expression of ser 46 -phosphorylated p53 and active caspase 3 in ARV-infected BHK-21 cells was reduced markedly following treatment with MG132. This suggested that MG132 decreased ARV infectivity and possessed the anti-apoptotic effect that may be due to reduced viral replication, especially down-regulation of C expression (Fig. 3B-C) .How does the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulate ARV replication? Perhaps the ubiquitination of viral proteins is required for ubiquitin-proteasome mediated viral replication, such as ssRNA-and dsRNA-binding proteins NS and A which are essential for ARV replication. Elucidation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathways involved in avian reovirus replication and induction of apoptosis will contribute important new information leading to better understanding of the mechanisms by which viruses in general cause cell death and diseases. Further study is undergoing to address these questions.In conclusion, it was shown that proteasome inhibitor reduces ARV replication through inhibition of viral RNA transcription and protein synthesis, thus preventing ARV-induced apoptosis. The results suggest that ARV may have developed certain mechanisms, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, to inhibit apoptosis or viral replication by inactivating the p53 pathway.""}",Proteasome inhibition reduces avian reovirus replication and apoptosis induction in cultured cells,"Abstract The interplay between avian reovirus (ARV) replication and apoptosis and proteasome pathway was studied in cultured cells. It is shown that inhibition of the proteasome did not affect viral entry and host cell translation but had influence on ARV replication and ARV-induced apoptosis. Evidence is provided to demonstrate that ubiquitin-proteasome blocked ARV replication at an early step in viral life cycle. However, viral transcription and protein translation were also reduced markedly after addition of proteasome inhibitor MG132. Treatment of BHK-21 cells with the MG132 markedly decreased virus titer as well as prevented virus-induced apoptosis. The expression of ARV proteins σC, σA, and σNS was also reduced markedly, suggesting that suppression of virus replication is due to down-regulation of these ARV proteins by ubiquitin-proteasome system. MG132 was also shown to suppress ARV σC-induced phosphrylation of p53 on serine 46, caspase 3 activities, and DNA fragmentation leading to complete inhibition of ARV-induced apoptosis.",10.1016/j.jviromet.2008.03.016,Elsevier; Medline; PMC,PMC7119659,18455810.0,els-covid,2008-07-31,Journal of Virological Methods,,,,23446377.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2008.03.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093408001031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18455810/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093408001031,2008.0,paper

Apparently, mRNPs spend some time in the interchromatin. Varying sizes of pools of gene-specific mRNPs, therefore, exist. Unproductive encounters between the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) and individual mRNPs can occur [10] [11] [12] , either because the mRNPs do not have the necessary components, in this sense, are not export competent, or because the docking process at the NPC simply fails. When export competent mRNPs successfully dock at the NPCs, they are subsequently translocated through the NPC channel and thereafter released into the cytoplasm. During translocation, both conformational and compositional changes take place within the mRNPs.We will outline the processes at the active gene, in the interchromatin and at the NPC that together result in the formation and export of functional mRNPs. It is clear that there is a close physical and functional coupling between transcription, processing, and assembly of pre-mRNPs and mRNPs. The mRNP obtains a processed structure and a collection of proteins that will influence the downstream events. The intricate physical and functional couplings are likely to have evolved, because they enhance coordination, efficiency, and regulation of the multiple steps of gene expression (Fig. 1) . We will provide a cell biological view, focusing on the spatial and temporal aspects of formation and export of mRNPs, a perspective that is required for a In the interchromatin. c At the NPC. Processes that occur at each location are listed to the left. a The actively transcribing protein-coding gene (parallel black lines) provides an optimal environment in which RNA pol II (blue oval) produces a pre-mRNA (purple oval). During transcription, the pre-mRNA is folded and assembled with proteins (green triangle and grey square) into a pre-mRNP (purple oval). Several processing machineries (orange circle) transiently interact with the pre-mRNA, modify it, and leave protein marks at specific positions. b After release from the gene, processing can be completed and the mRNPs (purple ovals) move by diffusion within the interchromatin channel network, making up pools of gene-specific mRNPs. Additional components, for example the main export receptor NXF1, can be recruited to the mRNPs, that then become export competent (dark blue oval). Chromatin is depicted as striped areas. c mRNPs interact with the NPCs (green) that are imbedded in the nuclear membrane (parallel black lines). A majority of the interactions are non-productive and the mRNPs return into the interchromatin. If fully export competent, the mRNPs are translocated through the central channel of the NPC. The export is coupled to conformational and compositional changes of the mRNPs full understanding of the intranuclear steps of gene expression. This cell biological view is largely based on studies of specialized, polytene cells that allow morphological, spatial, and temporal insights into the nuclear processes [13] .Active genes-optimal nuclear microenvironments for transcription, pre-mRNP assembly, and processingThe cell nucleus contains several functional compartments which are maintained despite the lack of an enclosing membrane and the dynamic exchange of components with the surrounding nucleoplasm [14] . Compartmentalization creates microenvironments that are believed to facilitate coordination, efficiency, and regulation. The molecular mechanisms for establishing nuclear compartments are not well understood, but it has been suggested that they can be formed by either random self-organization or by an ordered assembly pathway. In addition, a so-called seeding mechanism could contribute [15, 16] . Several compartments form at sites of transcription, in a transcription-dependent manner, suggesting a role for RNA. The RNA can then nucleate the formation of the compartment. Both coding and noncoding transcripts are capable of attracting and retaining freely diffusible components from the nucleoplasmic pool [16, 17] . In vitro, interactions between RNAs and proteins can result in reversible membrane-free structures [18] . If such structures, so-called droplets or hydrogels, reflect the in vivo situation, special physical and biochemical properties could possibly favour different biological processes. RNA-protein assemblies may associate with components that play important roles in gene expression [19] or influence aggregates involved in diseases [20] .Transcribing genes may represent transient microenvironments favourable for mRNP formation (Fig. 1) . Upon gene activation, the chromatin is extensively modified and unfolded, forming loops. Such loops can be readily visualized in specialized cells, such as amphibian oocytes [21] and polytene cells [13, 22] . Electron microscopy (EM) has revealed unfolded active genes also in mammalian diploid cell nuclei in perichromatin regions [23] . In situ hybridization experiments have also demonstrated unfolding of active genes [24] . Transcription activation can lead to transient physical proximity of the genes [25] . It has been suggested that transcription occurs in statically assembled structures, so-called transcription factories [26] . However, clustering of RNA pol II upon gene activation has been demonstrated to be transient [27] . In the polytene Balbiani ring (BR) gene loci, efficient recruitment of RNA pol II and proteins needed for pre-mRNP assembly and processing takes place upon transcription activation and apparently at the level of the individual gene locus. The presence of many active gene copies in the polytene chromosome results in a high local concentration of transcription and processing machineries that could be beneficial.The functional significance of chromatin unfolding and the establishment of a microenvironment for transcription and pre-mRNA processing need to be further investigated. The relative contribution of chromatin modifications, the transcription process itself, and the presence of transcripts must be clarified. We need specific examples of endogenous genes in living cells to learn the rules and variations that appear to exist in different types of cells (mammalian diploid cells, yeast cells, polytene cells). Even if technologies have been developed, such as 3C (chromatin conformation capture), 4C-seq [28] , and sophisticated fluorescence microscopy techniques, new methods are needed that allow analyses in vivo.It is still not clear how recruitment of factors to active genes is brought about, although several mechanisms have been proposed (Fig. 2) . Many proteins and preformed complexes, for example SR proteins and snRNPs, have affinity for the nascent transcript. The binding is sometimes mediated by specific sequences in the RNA [29] [30] [31] . Other proteins and complexes bind not directly to the transcript, but in layers of interactions to already bound components [32, 33] Fig. 2 Recruitment of components for pre-mRNA processing and pre-mRNP assembly at the gene. The transcribing protein-coding gene (parallel black lines), the RNA pol II with its CTD (blue), the growing pre-mRNA (purple), processing machineries (boxes in shades of green), and various components (orange circles) are shown schematically. a-g Different pathways for recruitment of factors to the growing pre-mRNP. These pathways are briefly explained in the figure (listed to the left) such as preformation of sub complexes [35] and local recycling. The latter has been suggested for RNA pol II through coordination between transcription and 3\u2032 end processing [36, 37] . Another way of coordinating interactions between the transcript and specific proteins is via the RNA pol II elongation complex. As the 5\u2032 end of the RNA emerges from the exit tunnel, the capping enzyme, bound to the RNA pol II, is in position to rapidly cap the 5\u2032 end [38] . The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA pol II is implicated as a flexible interaction platform that helps to recruit different factors [39] . The CTD consists of many heptapeptide repeats that are phosphorylated differently during initiation, elongation, and termination of transcription. It has been shown that the RNA guanyltransferase binds to the CTD during transcription initiation [40, 41] have been shown to bind to the CTD. Presumably, the role of the CTD modifications for recruitment of processing components will be even more appreciated. Methods to couple phospho-specific CTD modifications to interactions with defined proteins using specific antibodies combined with mass spectrometry is a promising start [49] .Structural studies of purified spliceosomes are improving [50], but high-resolution structural analyses of coupled transcription complexes and spliceosomes, at genes, are not yet reached [51] . The elongating RNA pol II contains additional components that help in recruiting mRNP biogenesis factors. In yeast, phosphorylated hexa-repeats in the elongation factor Spt5 are involved in recruiting capping enzymes [52], the 3\u2032 end cleavage factor CFI [53] , and the Paf1 complex [54] which is possibly involved in 3\u2032 end processing."", ""Influences of chromatin on transcription and pre-mRNA processing"": ""The study of mRNP formation must consider all the coordinated events and interacting molecules at the active gene. One such consideration is the influence of chromatin on the transcription rate and pre-mRNA splicing [55] . The transcription rate can be uniform along exons and introns in long human genes [56] , but it is also established that transcription rates can change along a gene [57, 58] and that this influences splice site choices [59] . The presence of alternative binding sites in the nascent transcript can lead to competition for binding of the interacting machineries. To what extent a high transcription rate results in the presence of alternative binding sites is likely to depend on the exon-intron structure, the binding affinities, and the kinetics of processing reactions. Therefore, a simple relationship does not exist between transcription rate and for example alternative splice site choices [60] .Nucleosome density and deposition of histone variants can modulate the movement of RNA pol II [61] . Nucleosomes are unequally distributed in exons and introns. In general, they are more closely packed in exons than in introns and may thereby contribute to different transcriptional elongation rates in introns and exons, respectively [62] [63] [64] [65] . RNA pol II pause sites correlate with splice sites [66, 67] . Nucleosome positioning and composition could influence splice site recognition, although it is unclear to what extent the splicing process itself contributes to RNA pol II elongation slow down [68] . Several observations show that splicing and 3\u2032 end processing can influence transcription [69] [70] [71] .A number of histone modifications have been shown to influence splicing. Some of these may work through affecting the RNA pol II transcription rate and others by influencing the recruitment of splicing factors. One example is the H3K36 methylation that plays a role in nucleosome positioning and in limiting elongation rate and thereby influencing splicing [72] . H3K36 methylation can also indirectly recruit the splicing regulators PTB and SRSF1 to the gene via so-called histone mark readers [73, 74] . In addition, the recruitment of spliceosomal components can be controlled by histone modifications [75] . In addition to methylation, other modifications of histones have been described, for example phosphorylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitination. It remains to be determined if also these modifications have an impact on splicing. An emerging field is the role of small and long non-coding RNAs in local alterations of chromatin modifications that will influence the splicing pattern [76] .The close contact between the chromatin and the pre-mRNP enables functional interactions between them. It has been reported that a pre-mRNP can influence transcription by recruiting a histone acetyltransferase to the active gene [77] .Chromatin structure is likely to affect transcription termination. Nucleosomes are enriched downstream polyadenylation sites [64] , and may thereby be involved in RNA pol II pausing in the termination region. A possible mechanism could be R-loop induced antisense transcription leading to histone H3K9me2 modification and recruitment of heterochromatin protein1\u03b3 [78] ."", ""Nascent pre-mRNP formation"": ""Pre-mRNA folding All RNAs, including pre-mRNA and mRNA, have the ability to fold in alternative ways, following energy rules. Folding starts during transcription [79, 80] . The folding of an RNA is functionally important and it can influence interactions with trans-acting factors and itself be influenced by such interactions. Folding can have an impact on transcription [81] and the transcription rate can have an effect on RNA folding [82] . In addition, the folding of the pre-mRNA is dynamic, for example dictated by interactions with spliceosomes and not surprisingly, and the local structure in the pre-mRNA can affect splicing [83, 84] . Throughout the life of a pre-mRNA and an mRNA, the RNA exists in the context of an RNA-protein complex and this complex is repeatedly remodelled. Association of the pre-mRNA and mRNA with proteins has a profound effect on the folding of the RNA-protein complex."", ""Proteins that interact with pre-mRNA and mRNA"": ""The repertoire of proteins that associate with RNA is substantial and diverse [85] . Large-scale methods have broaden the identification of RNA-protein interactions, but in many cases, the functional importance of the interactions remains to be determined [29] . In general, RNA-binding proteins associate with RNAs using specific domains [30] . Several such domains have been characterized, for example the RBD (also called RRM) and the KH (hnRNP K-homology) domains. Many proteins with regulatory functions in gene expression contain multiple KH domains [86] . Other proteins involved in processes in gene expression contain one or more copies of RBDs. In fact, about 2% of the mammalian proteins contain this domain [87] . Examples include SR proteins [88] , hnRNP proteins [89] , poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) [90] , and the 3\u2032-processing protein CstF-64 [91] . RBDs have a typical structure and recognize crucial nucleotides in short degenerate sequence motifs. Sequence specificity and the binding domain sequence are often conserved [92] . In vitro, the binding affinity for individual tested domains is usually low, but in the cell, affinity might be higher, because other regions of the protein or even coupling to other proteins assist. In a given protein, an RBD can be combined with other kinds of domains that perform other types of functions, for example helicase activity or mediating protein-protein contacts. Proteins can recognize common mRNA structural elements, for example the m 7 G cap [93] , the poly(A) tail [8] , and the sugar-phosphate backbone [32] . Some proteins recognize specific sequence motifs, for example the poly(A) signal, and others associate in a sequence-independent manner with either secondary or tertiary folds [31] . They can be stably bound, for example as architectural elements that help to define mRNP organization, or transiently bound, for example involved in modulating specific steps of gene expression. Proteins can also bind indirectly to the pre-mRNA and mRNA via other factors, as in the exon junction complex (EJC) [32] . It should be pointed out that pre-mRNA processing machineries operate in the context of RNA-protein complexes and many proteins bind to the pre-mRNPs and mRNPs as a consequence of pre-mRNA processing, and examples include the cap-binding complex (CBC), the EJC, and PABPN1.Approximately, 20 different proteins (named A1 to U) belong to the group of heterogeneous nuclear proteins (hnRNPs) [94, 95] . These proteins bind to many different RNA pol II produced transcripts. They can bind at several positions in the pre-mRNA with some sequence preference. The hnRNPs are preferentially present in cell nuclei. This reflects that they can leave the mRNP before export or that they rapidly shuttle back from the cytoplasm to the nucleus or a combination of the two. Some hnRNPs can accompany the mRNP to the cytoplasm and into polysomes. When bound to pre-mRNPs, they can affect packaging and stability. It has been suggested that hnRNP C tetramers organize the pre-mRNA [96] . The hnRNPs influence the transcripts in many different ways, for example as part of the pre-mRNPs, they can influence processing [97] and in the cytoplasm, they play roles in mRNP translation and stability [95] .Methodological improvements are needed to characterize the complete protein content of specific endogenous pre-mRNPs. One must consider that the composition of pre-mRNPs is dynamic over time and along a gene. The BR pre-mRNPs at the gene, and the BR mRNPs in both the interchromatin and at the NPCs, are morphologically identifiable. This fact has made it possible to decide, using immune-EM, where proteins associate with and dissociate from these specific endogenous transcripts. So far, 34 different proteins were identified within BR pre-mRNPs. These proteins have functions related to transcription, capping, 3\u00b4 end cleavage and processing, splicing, packaging, export, and quality control [13] . Some proteins, such as hrp36 (an hnRNP), a Y-box protein, and some SR proteins, become incorporated into BR pre-mRNPs and stay associated with the mRNPs throughout export and into polysomes. Some proteins like Rrp6, UAP56, ALY/REF, RSF, and PABPN1 associate with the BR pre-mRNPs and leave the BR mRNPs at the NPC."", ""Pre-mRNP assembly and packaging"": ""During transcription, the growing pre-mRNA is rapidly and continuously assembled into a pre-mRNP complex, probably as soon as the transcript emerges at the surface of RNA pol II [98] . Many different proteins and processing machineries are incorporated (Fig. 2) [22, 99] , but the mechanisms of recruitment are not yet fully elucidated. Some of the interacting components bind to essentially all pre-mRNAs, such as the capping enzymes, CBC proteins, and PABPN1. The protein content in pre-mRNPs is also partly gene-specific, depending on the sequence and exon-intron structure of the pre-mRNA. The pre-mRNPs from different genes contain different combinations of proteins. This is exemplified by the observation that pre-mRNPs from different genes contain different combinations of members of the SR protein family. The protein distribution within pre-mRNPs also differs between genes [100, 101] .The molecular background for packaging of pre-mRNPs is unknown in almost all cases. It has been suggested that interactions between SR proteins and the EJC compact pre-mRNPs [102] . Dimerization of the poly(A)-binding protein Nab2, not only influences poly(A) tail length, but may also contribute to mRNP compaction [103] . Data show that specific pre-mRNPs are packaged into compact RNA-protein complexes, in close proximity to the elongating RNA pol II. High-resolution imaging of lampbrush nascent transcripts shows that these transcripts are tightly packed with proteins [104] .In perichromatin regions in mammalian cell nuclei, short fibrillar and granular structures presumably represent nascent pre-mRNPs [105] . The packaging of the endogenous BR1 and BR2 pre-mRNPs has been described using EM [22] . These approximately 40 kb-long pre-mRNAs, consisting mainly of exon sequences, are initially packaged into thin, 5-10 nm pre-mRNP fibers. Remodelling takes place, resulting in an approximately 20 nm thick, flexible RNP in which a thin 7 nm fibre probably is a basic structural element. The 20 nm fibre grows at its root until obtaining a length of 90 nm. At this stage, about 8 kb of the transcript is incorporated. Then, a conformational change at the tip of the 20 nm fibre results in a ribbon with a diameter of 26 nm, and subsequently, this ribbon compacts into a ringlike RNP with a final diameter of 50 nm. In contrast, in the BR3 gene, the pre-mRNA contains alternating short exons and introns throughout its length. The BR3 gene is 10.5 kb long, but because of the structurally dynamic splicing process, a full-length pre-mRNA is not present. The BR3 pre-mRNP structure is then dominated by the assembly, action, and release of spliceosomes [51] . Evidently, the exon-intron organization greatly influences the packaging of the pre-mRNPs. So far, a completely processed BR3 mRNP has not been possible to identify, and therefore, no structural information is available.The evolution of packaging of the pre-mRNP and mRNP has presumably been important for a number of reasons. Packaging might reduce the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids, so-called R-loops, which can cause genomic instability [106] . Furthermore, packaging of the pre-mRNP and mRNP in compact complexes probably facilitates diffusion through the interchromatin and at the same time provides a stable but yet flexible complex that can change structure and composition at the NPC."", ""Pre-mRNP processing at the gene and coupling to export"": ""At the gene, the pre-mRNA interacts with the processing machineries responsible for capping, splicing, and 3\u2032 cleavage and polyadenylation. The processing machineries all contribute to the composition and structure of the pre-mRNP and all leave marks in the mRNP that are important for subsequent events in gene expression, including export."", ""Capping"": ""Capping enzymes recognize the 5\u2032 end of the pre-mRNA, essentially as soon as it appears at the RNA pol II exit tunnel [38]. The nuclear cap-binding complex proteins CBC20 and CBC80 then bind to the cap, forming the CBC, also at the gene [107] . The CBP80 protein is important for recruitment of the TREX complex, including the export adaptor ALY/REF [108] . In the cytoplasm, the CBC is involved in the initial translation and is then replaced by eIF4E for efficient translation [5] ."", ""Splicing"": ""Intron excision requires the multicomponent spliceosome [109] . Spliceosome assembly takes place during ongoing transcription [110, 111] , evidently for a majority of pre-mRNAs [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] . Close proximity between the spliceosome, the RNA pol II, and the chromatin has been demonstrated [51]. Many studies have reported interactions between individual components of transcription and processing machineries. In most cases, these interactions, and especially their functional significance, are difficult to evaluate. We need improved methods to characterize and functionally evaluate protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions at active genes in living cells. In vivo rates for the splicing process have been reported to range from 30 s to several minutes [117] [118] [119] . Recent studies have demonstrated that the spliceosome can assemble on the pre-mRNA already when the RNA pol II has synthesized in the order of 24 nucleotides downstream a 3\u2032 splice site [120] . Efficient RNAseq methods combined with robust extraction of nascent transcripts are required for analysis of additional endogenous genes to learn the rules. Understanding the principles for constitutive splicing will be important for understanding regulation of splicing. Measurements of the precise kinetics of alternative splicing will be important to verify the molecular mechanisms involved. It will also be important to learn if and to what extent the rate of splicing can be modified. Introns are excised in an overall 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 order [117, 121] , but all introns are not necessarily excised at the gene. In a population of gene-specific pre-mRNAs, some of the transcripts lose their introns in the interchromatin [111, 121] . This may be due to variation in splicing kinetics, the length of the gene [56, 111] , and alternative splicing regulation. A nascent pre-mRNP can contain more than one intron, showing that spliceosome assembly and activity do not stall the RNA pol II until an intron is excised [51] . SR proteins are characterized by having one or more RNA-binding domains and a domain rich in serine-arginine repeats [122] . SR proteins bind to many different pre-mRNAs in gene-specific combinations [100, 101] . SR protein binding is at least partly sequence specific and is essential for the splicing reaction. Their phosphorylation level is important for the recruitment to pre-mRNAs and for the splicing reaction. SR proteins are required for constitutive splicing and can influence alternative splice site choices [123] . SR proteins influence also other steps in the biogenesis of mRNPs [124, 125] . As pointed out, SR proteins, in combination with EJC core components, may compact mRNPs [102] . SR proteins remain associated with mRNPs and are important for export, serving as export adaptors for NXF1, the main mRNP export receptor. It has also been described that SR proteins regulate 3\u2032 processing of pre-mRNAs [126] , mRNA stability [127] , and translation initiation [128] .Splicing is not only necessary for obtaining correct open reading frames. Splicing also leads to deposition of the EJC core [129] . EJCs associate in a splicing-dependent manner with pre-mRNAs, 20-24 nucleotides upstream the boundary between two joined exons [6] . The EJC core contains four proteins, eIF4AIII, the heterodimer Mago-Y14 and Barentsz. All four core proteins associate with the nascent pre-mRNA [130] . Mapping of binding sites shows that the full set of EJC core proteins, including Barentsz, are present at most exon-exon junctions, but additional binding sites exist for eIF4AIII [102, 131, 132] . The EJC core has the ability to recruit different proteins and thereby plays central roles in several post-transcriptional processes [129, 133] . These include recruitment of export adaptors and translation initiation factors and assembly of a functional nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) complex."", ""3\u2032 end cleavage, polyadenylation, and termination of transcription"": ""Essentially, all pre-mRNAs are cleaved and polyadenylated by the 3\u2032 cleavage and polyadenylation machinery. The processes and responsible components are biochemically well characterized. Proper 3\u2032 end formation is necessary for mRNA export [134] . More than 70% of the mammalian protein-coding genes produce isoforms differing in alternative polyadenylation sites [135] .A part of the polyadenylation machinery is recruited to the transcript via the RNA pol II CTD [42, 43] . Interactions between the TREX components ALY/REF and THOC5 with several proteins of the 3\u2032 processing machinery indicate that TREX is important for 3\u2032 processing and possibly for release of the transcript from the gene. The cleavage reaction takes place at the gene. In the BR1 gene, microdissection revealed that a population of correctly spliced and cleaved mRNPs was present at the gene. This population had a short poly(A) tail, 10-20 adenylate residues long [136] . In the interchromatin, a switch from a distributive to a processive elongation mode of polyadenylation then took place, adding on average 100 adenylate residues. The presence of a population of mRNPs with short poly(A) tails at the gene could be due to retention of the mRNP during the initial polyadenylation reaction, possibly involving the 3\u2032 processing machinery. Moreover, it could reflect the initial distributive phase of polyadenylation observed in vitro. The length of the poly(A) tail is controlled by PABPN1 [8] . Other proteins are also involved, for example the mammalian protein Nucleophosmin 1 that is deposited onto the mRNA upstream the poly(A) signal [137] . Release of mRNPs from the gene requires splicing, cleavage at a correct polyadenylation signal, and polyadenylation [138] . The mechanism for mRNP release from the gene and the potential relationship to termination of transcription is still unclear.Some genes are extremely long, emphasising that synthesis of pre-mRNAs is dependent on the processivity of RNA Pol II [56] . Synthesis is also dependent on the recognition of appropriate transcription termination signals [139] . During transcription, RNA Pol II may be stalled or prematurely terminated [139] . Several situations can influence transcription termination, for example viral infection [140] , cancer [141] and osmotic stress [142] . Transcription termination influences alternative poly(A) site usage [135] . This is functionally important, because mRNA isoforms with different lengths of their 3\u2032 UTRs can have different stability, localization in the cytoplasm, and translation properties [143] .Studies in yeast show that both Nab2p and Pab1p, the mammalian orthologs PABPN1 and PABPC1, bind poly(A) tails. Nab2p is predominantly located in the nucleus and Pab1p in the cytoplasm. Nab2p protects poly(A) RNA from degradation by the exosome [144] and promotes export by interacting with the NPC protein Mlp1 [145] . Nab2p may further interact with the spliceosome and with Rrp6 to integrate splicing and pre-mRNP decay [146] ."", ""Quality control"": ""Synthesis and processing of pre-mRNPs are complex molecular events that are not always perfectly performed. Aberrant products can be made and the cell must be able to handle these. The presence of quality control systems has been demonstrated in cells having specific mutations in the RNA or by knocking down enzymes that normally degrade aberrant RNAs. Transcripts with defects in capping, assembly, splicing, and 3\u2032 end formation have all been shown to be degraded [147] . Degradation can occur at the gene by 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonucleases such as Xrn2 or by the exosome [148] .Transcripts with retained introns or defective 3\u2032 ends have been shown to be retained at the gene [149] [150] [151] [152] . The exosome is needed for this retention [147] . In yeast, export-incompetent mRNPs are retained at the gene through the action of the chromatin remodelling complex ISW1 in cooperation with Rrp6 [153] . The retention can lead to degradation [154] , or an alternative outcome could be increased time for completion of processing [155] . It is likely that the degradation, processing, and RNA-protein assembly events balance each other. These balances may be examples of kinetic proofreading [156] .In a broader sense, it can be argued that also the deposition of proteins in connection to pre-mRNA processing provides a quality control. For example, a non-correct EJC will not support downstream processes such as export and translation."", ""Recruitment of export adaptors is linked to transcription and processing"": ""An mRNP released from its gene is in several aspects likely to be ready for export to the cytoplasm. It is folded in a compact but flexible manner. It is equipped for downstream processes, with a CBC, a large number of different proteins, a poly(A) tail, and it is spliced to have a translatable open reading frame. The question is what more an mRNP must contain to be export competent in the sense that it can be channelled through an NPC. An obvious answer is that each mRNP requires export adaptors and export receptors. Evolution has resulted in multiple different export adaptors and their recruitment to mRNPs is promoted by transcription and processing. The two main export receptors, NXF1 and CRM1, interact with different sets of export adaptors (Fig. 3) . Many adaptors are present in the mRNP at the time of release from the gene.The TREX complex is a conserved complex that has functions in transcription elongation, mRNA export, and genome stability [157, 158] . It includes the THO complex and the helicase UAP56. UAP56 promotes spliceosome assembly and is also an EJC component. In addition, many other proteins are found in the TREX complex [158] , among these, the export adaptor ALY/REF. Recruitment of TREX to the pre-mRNP is coupled to transcription elongation, capping, splicing, and 3\u2032 end processing. The recruitment is facilitated through the association with the Ser2 phosphorylated CTD of RNA pol II [45, 159] and by the elongation Prp19 complex [160] . TREX can be recruited to the 5\u2032 UTR of the pre-mRNA, dependent on the CBP80 protein [108] and on splicing [161] . The TREX subunit ALY/REF interacts with the EJC component eIF4AIII [162] , making it likely that the EJC is involved in loading TREX onto the pre-mRNA. In yeast, ALY/REF can also interact with Pcf1, a 3\u2032 cleavage factor [163] . UAP56 is involved in recruiting ALY/REF [164] and other proteins that influence export adaptor function. The mammalian DDX39 protein is a UAP56 paralog and has overlapping functions. UAP56 has also been shown to interact with UIF, which can bind to NXF1 and thus serve as an export adaptor [165] .TREX-2 is another conserved protein complex that has been shown to interact with the NPC basket [166, 167] and also with the export receptor NXF1 in mammals and Mex67 in yeast [168, 169] . In addition, studies in yeast have shown that subunits of TREX-2 interact with the SAGA histone acetylase complex and the promoter-bound Mediator complex [170, 171] and could thereby provide a functional link, and possibly physical coupling, between transcription initiation and mRNP export through the NPC. The TREX-2 subunit GANP can interact directly with NXF1, but it is unclear whether it is a general export factor. It has been shown that GANP is involved in the selective export of specific mRNAs, including those coding for components involved in mRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis [172] . The GANP-dependent export pathway may thereby facilitate rapid changes in gene expression.SR proteins can serve as export adaptors [173, 174] . SR proteins remain bound to mRNAs after splicing and different mRNPs have different combinations of SR proteins [100, 101] . SRSF3 has been shown to bind to the last exon and may promote export of mRNA isoforms with long 3\u2032 UTRs, by recruiting NXF1 [175] ."", ""mRNPs in the interchromatin compartment"": ""Even if many processes in mRNP formation occur at the gene, important events such as completion of processing, binding of export receptors, and intranuclear transport take place in the interchromatin compartment (Fig. 4) . The protein content of gene-specific mRNPs, and how this might change in the interchromatin, is essentially unknown. This is difficult to analyse, and so far, only average data for mRNP populations are available. The fact that most mRNPs cannot be structurally studied in diploid cells is further a drawback. Until better methods are developed, we rely on special cell types and special genes, such as polytene cells and BR mRNPs, for model studies."", ""Processing in the interchromatin"": ""Splicing can occur post-transcriptionally. Fractionation of cell nuclei, followed by quantification of the catalytically active SF3b155 protein, estimated that about 20% of splicing takes place in the nucleoplasmic fraction [112] . Several other examples of post-transcriptional removal of introns have been reported [83, [176] [177] [178] . The time remaining from the synthesis of an intron until transcription termination and 3\u2032 processing influences if intron excision is completed co-or post-transcriptionally [56, 111, 121] . In a population of gene-specific pre-mRNAs, excision of a given intron can take place during transcription in most transcripts and be completed after release from the gene in the remaining transcripts [111] . This suggests that even if spliceosome assembly is initiated during transcription, the splicing reaction does not need to occur at the gene. An interesting question is, if co-transcriptional splicing requires the RNA Pol II and its CTD, how can post-transcriptional splicing do without it? Possibly, the initial steps of spliceosome assembly take place during transcription, while completion of splicing can be performed away from the gene. Clusters of granules in the interchromatin, called interchromatin granule clusters at the EM level and speckles at the light microscope level, contain high concentrations of spliceosome components [179] . The full functional significance of this compartment remains to be elucidated. Storage sites for spliceosomal components are one possibility and it is well established that SR proteins are recruited from the granule clusters to nascent pre-mRNPs and that phosphorylation regulates this recruitment [180] . Transcribing genes are often located at the surface of the granule clusters. The proximity between active genes and the granule clusters may well-facilitate spliceosomal recruitment to the nascent transcripts. Active spliceosomes have been detected in speckles [112] , suggesting that some introns are excised in this environment. During influenza A viral infection, a balance between synthesis of unspliced M1 mRNA and spliced M2 mRNA is established. The M2 mRNA seems to be generated by splicing within interchromatin granule clusters. It may be a way to ensure efficient supply of spliceosomal components. Interestingly, the viral NS1 protein in combination with a host NS1-binding protein is needed for targeting the M1 mRNAs to the speckles [181] . Synthesis of the poly(A) tail can be completed in the interchromatin. In BR genes, isolation by microdissection showed that polyadenylation is initiated at the gene and can be completed after release into the interchromatin [136] ."", ""Structure of mRNPs"": ""So far, we know very little about the structure of endogenous gene-specific mRNPs. The best characterized examples are the BR1 and BR2 mRNPs. These mRNPs, containing approximately 40 kb-long mRNAs, have a well-defined three-dimensional structure, and this structure has a hierarchy of folding that is established largely during transcription. At a first level, a 7 nm mRNP fibre is further folded, forming a 26 nm ribbon. This ribbon is folded into an overall ring-like complex [182] .In yeast, EM analyses of purified mRNP populations suggest that mRNPs have an extended shape with lateral restrictions [183] . The length of these ribbon-like structures increased when the length of the mRNA increased, while their diameter remained approximately 5 nm. The mRNA in mRNPs is thus folded into a compact structure. Furthermore, the length of the mRNA influences the overall dimensions of the compacted mRNPs."", ""Association of proteins with mRNPs in the interchromatin"": ""High sensitive mass spectrometry analyses of proteins that UV-crosslink to and co-purify with poly(A) RNAs have revealed a large number of proteins in direct contact with mRNAs. In mammalian cells, approximately 800 proteins are associated with the mRNA population [184, 185] . Enriched yeast mRNPs have been shown to contain several examples of export factors [183] . Purified in vitro spliced defined mRNPs contain approximately 45 different proteins [186] .Studies of endogenous gene-specific mRNPs are rare, but required for knowledge of the fate and behaviour of mRNPs. Experimental advantages make it possible to analyse properties of the BR1 and BR2 mRNPs. Already at release from the gene, these mRNPs are packaged and equipped with the majority of its associated proteins. BR1 and BR2 mRNPs have a protein content of about 60%, presumably corresponding to about 500 individual proteins [187] . Some proteins are likely to be present in multiple copies in a single mRNP. Immune-EM has identified 41 different proteins within BR pre-mRNPs and mRNPs. These proteins have functions related to transcription, capping, 3\u2032 end cleavage and processing, splicing, packaging, export, quality control, and translation [13] .BR mRNPs retain their morphology at the ultrastructural level from the release from the gene until translocation through the NPC. Even so, immune-EM has demonstrated that BR mRNPs recruit some proteins in the interchromatin. One example is the RNA helicase Ct-hrp84 [188] . Most notably, this is the case for the export receptor NXF1 and the NMD factors UPF2 and UPF3 [13] . The BR pre-mRNPs and the mRNPs released from the gene contain several export adaptors and it is so far unknown why NXF1 is not recruited until the mRNP is present in the interchromatin. Possible explanations include necessary structural adaptor rearrangements in the BR mRNP and requirement of so far unknown factors only present in the interchromatin. In mammalian cells, NXF1 has been located throughout the nucleus but not at active genes [189] . Furthermore, NXF1 has been shown to interact with ALY/REF close to speckles [190] ."", ""mRNA modifications"": ""Modified bases are important for the function of noncoding RNAs, such as tRNAs and rRNAs. More recently, it has been discovered that also mRNAs are subjected to chemical modifications that can influence and regulate their function and fate [191] [192] [193] . So far, N 6 -methyladenosine, pseudouridine, 5-methylcytosine, N 1 -methyl-6adenosine, and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine modifications of coding RNAs were identified in eukaryotic cells. The m 6 A modification is the one most thoroughly analysed and described to date. The modifications can induce conformational changes of the RNA. They can also interfere with RNA-protein interactions by either blocking or facilitating the binding of specific proteins.The enzymes that mediate and the enzymes that remove the modifications are mostly found in the nucleus, but can, in some cases, also be localized to the cytoplasm. Thus, both nuclear and cytoplasmic pre-mRNAs and mRNAs can be targeted and, perhaps, influenced in different ways, depending on the location. Studies of the modifications identified so far have reported consequences for splicing, export, translation, and stability of the pre-mRNPs and mRNPs [194, 195] ."", ""Export receptors"": ""For export, mRNPs depend on association with export receptors (Fig. 3) . These receptors mediate productive interactions with the NPC. Export receptors need adaptor proteins for binding to mRNPs. The majority of mRNPs uses the receptor NXF1/NXT1 heterodimer for their export [157, 196, 197] . NXF1 has an N-terminal RBD and can bind to RNA weakly, but with increased affinity in the presence of ALY/REF. It has a leucine-rich region that together with the RBD can bind to CTE motifs in viral RNAs [198] . In addition, NXF1 has a C-terminal ubiquitin-associated domain and a domain similar to that found in NTF2. This domain is important for several protein interactions [199] . The two latter domains can interact with FG-containing NPC proteins. NXF1 binds weakly and unspecific to mRNA, but upon recruitment via the adapter ALY/REF and THOC5, NXF1 is remodelled to expose its RBD, facilitating the binding to RNA [200] . Consistent with NXF1 binding to several export adaptors, at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, as well as within transcripts, it is likely that multiple copies of NXF1 bind to individual mRNPs. Analysis by iCLIP has demonstrated many NXF1-binding sites in close proximity to the SR protein SRSF3 [175] . NXF1 interacts with several different proteins of the NPC during the translocation process. This will be discussed below.The major protein exporter CRM1, in association with Ran-GTP [201] , is also required for export of rRNPs, snRNPs, microRNAs, and tRNAs. In addition, it serves as an export receptor for a subset of mRNPs. CRM1 binds indirectly to mRNPs via different adaptors. Some mRNAs contain AU-rich sequence elements (AREs) in their 3\u2032 UTRs. The Human antigen R (HuR) protein that contains a Nuclear Export Signal (NES) binds to these elements and, in turn, binds CRM1. HuR has two ligands, pp32 and April, that link HuR to CRM1. The requirement for the HuR ligands appears to be mRNA specific. The ligands have been shown to mediate export of ARE-containing c-fos mRNA [202] [203] [204] .A number of mRNAs have a 50 nucleotides-long sequence in their 3\u2032 UTR that is sufficient to direct these mRNAs into an eIF4E and CRM1-dependent export pathway [205] . This so-called eIF4E-sensitivity element binds the adaptor protein, LRPPRC. This protein relocates eIF4E from PML bodies, possibly by competing for overlapping binding sites on eIF4E and also promotes the association of eIF4E with mRNAs [206] . LRPPRC mediates contact with CRM1, allowing transport through the NPC.The NXF family member NXF3 can also recruit CRM1 to mRNPs.Several observations show that interactions between export adaptors and receptors are more diversified than previously thought. Binding of the main mRNP export receptor, NXF1, to export adaptors shows variation. For example, in addition to SR proteins and ALY/REF, the neuron-specific HuD protein is an adaptor for NXF1 [207] . Components of TREX, other than ALY/REF, can contribute in recruiting NXF1. For example, THOC2 and THOC5 are involved in export of subsets of mRNPs [208] , and THOC5 is required for export of heat shock HSP70 mRNPs [209] .The combination of various ways of recruiting different export adaptors, dependent on processing and sequence specificity, and the subsequent binding of the export receptors, show that there are alternative export pathways. Through such diversified interactions, export of selected subpopulations of mRNAs can occur [210, 211] . During cellular stress, stress-specific mRNAs elude export quality control using an alternative mode of binding the export receptor Mex67 [212] ."", ""Pools of mRNPs in the nucleus and movement through the interchromatin"": ""Diploid cell nuclei contain chromosome territories and different compartments [213, 214] . Active chromatin is found in perichromatin regions at the periphery of the inactive chromatin. The interchromatin compartment makes up nearly 50% of the nuclear volume and forms an irregular network of narrow channels, often connected to NPCs. The differences in chromatin density are likely to considerably affect the movement of mRNPs.EM analyses have demonstrated that BR mRNPs in polytene nuclei, largely devoid of chromatin, move in all directions after release from the genes [215] . This observation is in agreement with studies of single mRNPs in diploid cell nuclei where no directionality in mRNP movement has been recorded. Accordingly, inside nuclei, mRNPs move by diffusion [216] [217] [218] [219] . The movement is likely to be restricted by the chromatin and mainly taking place through the network of interchromatin channels. It has been calculated that the movement of mRNPs from the active gene to the NPC takes between 6 and 50 min in diploid nuclei [9, 220] . Different diffusion characteristics have been described for different mRNPs. Small mRNPs tend to move faster than large mRNPs [9] . Thus, a nucleus contains pools of mRNPs and the pools are of different sizes for specific mRNPs. For a specific gene, the size of such a pool is likely to be influenced by transcription, processing, and diffusion characteristics. Nuclear pools of processed mRNPs have been described for several genes and suggested to buffer the level of cytoplasmic mRNPs [221] .Quantitative measurements and calculations for BR mRNPs show that the interchromatin in polytene nuclei contains a pool of BR mRNPs. No or little degradation of BR mRNPs takes place in the nucleus [222] . In vivo, individual BR mRNPs in the pool move irregularly by diffusion and they interact occasionally with interchromatin fibers [223] [224] [225] . Approximately equal numbers of BR mRNPs, about half the size of the interchromatin pool, are synthesized and are exported to the cytoplasm per time unit. Immune-EM analyses show that BR mRNPs associate with the export receptor CRM1 at the gene [226] , although CRM1 does not seem to be important for export of BR mRNPs. The BR mRNPs also associate with several NXF1 adaptors, for example SR proteins. However, in the interchromatin pool, only about 25% of the BR mRNPs contain NXF1 at a given moment [130] . It is, therefore, possible that BR mRNPs move around by diffusion in the interchromatin and randomly bind NXF1.In the nuclei of mammalian cells, it appears that pools of poly(A) RNAs with retained introns are frequent [227, 228] . It has also been shown that subsets of introns in mammalian mRNAs have long half-lives and that their excision is influenced by the kinase Clk, possibly by affecting the phosphorylation of SR proteins and splicing [228] . Export of unspliced mRNAs may normally be restricted [229, 230] . Restricted export of incompletely spliced mRNAs using NXF1 involves the NPC associated protein Tpr [231] . However, both endogenous and viral mRNAs with retained introns can be exported and translated [232] [233] [234] . Incompletely spliced mRNAs are often subjected to degradation by the NMD pathway.It is likely that a balance between intranuclear processing, degradation, and diffusion regulates mRNP export and thus influences the size of the pool of specific mRNPs. Retention and degradation of incompletely spliced mRNAs may be involved in neuronal development. It has been proposed that the protein PTB represses splicing, and that nuclear degradation of the incompletely spliced mRNA follows. The exosome and Tpr are involved [235] . Specific cases of intron retention may be important in homeostatic control of gene expression. The PABPN1 is such an example, where an interplay between the level of PABPN1, retention of a 3\u2032 terminal intron, and nuclear exosome activity regulates PABPN1 synthesis [236] ."", ""At the nuclear pore complex (NPC)"": ""The NPC mediates almost all bidirectional transport of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. In special circumstances, unconventional transport pathways may be used. For example, viruses can rebuild the NPC, allowing transport of viral mRNPs [237] and large mRNPs can exit the nucleus through nuclear envelope budding [238, 239] .As shown in the BR system, an mRNP is largely produced at the gene and appears only modestly reorganized or modified in the interchromatin compartment [13] .Additional studies of specific mRNPs are needed to substantiate this conclusion. In contrast, during interaction of the mRNP with the NPC, drastic structural and compositional changes take place, concomitant with its delivery into the cytoplasm (Fig. 5) ."", ""Structure and composition of NPCs"": ""The structure and composition of NPCs are well characterized [240, 241] . The size of an NPC is estimated to be between 50 and 125 MDa, depending on the species. The NPC has an eightfold ring symmetry. The core consists of a central channel positioned between a nuclear and a cytoplasmic ring. Fibrillar structures are present on both the nuclear and cytoplasmic sides. An NPC is built from about 500-1000 individual proteins belonging to the approximately 30 different types of nucleoporins (Nups). The transmembrane Nups anchor the NPC in the nuclear membrane. The structural Nups provide a scaffold for other Nups. The FG Nups contain domains with repetitive motifs of phenylalanine (F) and glycine (G) residues. The FGrich domains are flexible and disordered, and they fill the central channel of the NPC, forming a barrier. Small molecules can diffuse through the NPC, but as the size reaches approximately 5 nm in diameter and/or 30-40 kDa in mass, the permeability is restricted. The fibrillar structure on the nuclear side consists of eight fibrils attached to the nuclear ring of the core. The ends of the fibrils can interconnect, forming a basket. On the cytoplasmic side, there are eight fibril structures, making up an mRNP export interaction platform [242] ."", ""Export kinetics"": ""Transport of mRNPs through the NPC occurs in three steps: docking onto the nuclear basket, translocation through the central channel, and release from the cytoplasmic fibrillar structures. Measurements of fluorescently labelled single mRNPs regarding the time for NPC interaction vary, ranging from 12 ms to several seconds [9-12, 243, 244] . These differences may be due to technical differences or reflect variations for different mRNPs. In several cases, translocation through the central channel was fast, while times for docking and release were longer. Furthermore, only a minority (25-35%) of the interactions between the mRNPs and the NPCs resulted in export."", ""Mechanism of translocation"": ""At the ultrastructural level, the interaction between the NPC and endogenous gene-specific mRNPs has been best characterized for the BR mRNPs. The process lasts for 65 ms to several seconds [11] . In vivo, interactions between BR mRNPs with the NPCs result in productive translocations in a minority of the occasions. In 60-75% of the cases, the BR mRNPs return into the interchromatin compartment. The explanation for unproductive NPC association is not known, but may reflect that some mRNPs lack a full set of export receptors. In the case of BR mRNPs, about 75% of the mRNPs in the interchromatin lack the NXF1 receptor [12] . It is also possible that unprocessed mRNPs can be retained, as mediated by Mlp1 in yeast [245] and Tpr in mammals [231] . Since only a very small part of the pool of BR mRNPs in the interchromatin still contains introns (less than 5%) [111] , we consider this explanation unlikely in this case.When export occurs, a BR mRNP first interacts with the closed basket [246] . The basket ring opens up and the BR mRNP moves into the basket and subsequently into the opening of the central channel. This initial process involves Nup153 [247] and transient contact with Rae1 [248] . Several studies in other cell types demonstrate interactions between NXF1 and the basket component Tpr/Mlp1 at this stage. A complex between Rae1 and Nup98 is also involved [249] .For the BR mRNPs, a partial unfolding then follows and its bent 26 nm ribbon becomes more straight as it moves through the central channel. The 5\u2032 end leads the way [250] , while the 3\u2032 end of the BR mRNP remains in contact with the basket ring. Other studies have shown that during translocation, NXF1 interacts sequentially with the FG Nups [251] . The transport of large mRNPs is facilitated if the cargo binds multiple export receptors. The exact mechanism of mRNP translocation is still unclear. Several transport models have been proposed for how export receptors (and import receptors) facilitate transport through the FG-Nup barrier. These include the selective phase, the reduction of dimensionality, and the virtual gating models [252, 253] . Extensive unfolding may be necessary for large mRNPs, such as the BR mRNPs. The reason for unfolding may be coupled to the translocation process or be dictated by space limitations of the NPC. We do not know if a conformational change is obligatory also for smaller mRNPs. Furthermore, the fact that BR mRNPs reach the cytoplasm with its 5\u2032 end first could reflect efficient assembly of polysomes already in the perinuclear compartment, in a secretory cell. It remains to be demonstrated if this polarity of translocation is valid also for mRNPs, in general. If so, it could rather reflect the translocation process.At the cytoplasmic side of the NPC, there is additional unfolding of the BR mRNP into a 7-10 nm mRNP fibre. Other studies have shown that upon exit from the central channel, mRNPs associate with the cytoplasmic part of the NPC [254] . A recent study has described how the Nups at the cytoplasmic side are oriented inward towards the central channel [242] , presumably streamlining the passage of the mRNPs from the FG-repeats in the channel to a cytoplasmic platform. At this platform, the mRNPs are remodelled as a result of the coordinated action of the DEAD-box Here, the mRNP looses many, but not all proteins (blue hexagon and grey square). The helicase Dbp5 (light purple ovals) associated with the fibers and ATP hydrolysis are involved. In the CRM1-dependent export pathway, GTP hydrolysis is required for mRNP release helicase DDX19 (in yeast Dbp5), Gle1 (in yeast Gle), and its cofactor inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), and Nup214 (in yeast Nup159) [255] . Export factors are removed during remodelling, and eventually recycled back to the nucleus [256] . It is likely that many proteins remain bound to the mRNP. In the case of BR mRNPs, it has been demonstrated that, for example, SR, hnRNP, and Y-box proteins are not removed at this stage. The compositional and conformational change of the mRNP promotes directionality and it will prevent the mRNP from traveling back into the NPC. A deeper insight into the molecular changes in mRNP composition and where and when these changes occur in relation to NPCs and the translocation process will require high-resolution studies of endogenous mRNPs.In the cytoplasm, the mRNP is again remodelled [257] . For example, the CBC proteins are replaced by eIF4E, thereby permitting steady-state translation and PABPN1 is replaced by PABPC, important for stability and translation."", ""Formation and export of mRNPs linked to disease"": ""Given the importance of mRNP formation and export for gene expression, it is not surprising that a great number of defects in these processes have been connected to diseases. An important field of investigation is how dysregulation of splicing can be involved in cancerogenesis [258, 259] . Splicing defects in cancer cells can result from basepair substitutions in splice sites or in splicing regulatory sequences. Mutations can also affect the structure and function or expression levels of spliceosomal components and proteins that regulate splicing. Splicing defects have also been described in many other diseases [260] . These include neurological disorders such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Spinal muscular dystrophy.Dysregulation of export components, including CRM1, THOC1, Rae1, and eIF4E, is described in different types of cancer cells [261] . In accordance with their roles in gene expression, several hnRNPs (hnRNP A1, C, and E1) influence expression of oncogenes in cancer cells and in neurons [262] . A possible link between mutations in a gene encoding a mammalian Nab2 orthologue and a neurodevelopment disorder has been reported [263] . Proteins connected to the NPC, for example, mammalian Nup88, Nup214, Nup98, and Gle1, have also been implicated in cancer, developmental, and neural diseases [264] [265] [266] .Replication of viruses depends on host cell gene expression machineries and can thereby affect mRNP formation and transport. Viruses are studied for the obvious medical implications for developing treatments against viral infections. A second reason is that viral infections often provide experimental advantages and short cuts in understanding cellular processes. This is exemplified by the fruitful studies of splicing of adenovirus pre-mRNAs [267] .During viral infection, the host cells activate defense mechanisms and the viruses interfere with the host cells to maximize viral replication. A common viral strategy is to shutoff host cell gene expression. In this way, the cellular immune response is evaded and resources are directed towards viral replication. Down-regulation of host cell gene expression can take place at most levels and individual viruses can use more than one mechanism.Transcription can be inhibited. For example, the 3C protease of the poliovirus cleaves TFIID [268] and Sindbis virus protein nsP2 induces degradation of the largest subunit of RNA pol II [269] .Pre-mRNA processing is also targeted. The influenza virus protein NS1 binds CPSF and inhibits PABP binding, thus interfering with 3\u2032 cleavage and polyadenylation [140, 270] . NS1 furthermore inhibits splicing by interfering with spliceosomal snRNP interactions [271] . The herpes simplex virus ICP27 protein inhibits splicing using multiple mechanisms [272, 273] .Many viruses, including herpes, influenza, and corona viruses, use viral or cellular endonucleases to degrade host cell mRNAs [274] . At the same time, it is important that viral mRNAs avoid being targeted for degradation [275] .Export of viral mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm has attracted considerable interest. In general, viruses take over cellular export factors, for example, the NXF1 and CRM1 export receptors, using a variety of strategies. Several viruses produce mRNAs that contain elements that can bind TREX [276] or that can directly bind NXF1 [277] . Other viruses, such as influenza and Hepatitis B viruses, produce specific export adaptor proteins. These proteins recruit ALY/REF or DDX39B and TREX and subsequently NXF1 [278, 279] . Other examples of cis-acting elements present in viral mRNAs that can bind export factors are the element in type D retroviruses that directly bind NXF1 [277, 280] , and the Rev response element in HIV-1 mRNA that binds multimerized Rev proteins which, in turn, bind CRM1 [281, 282] ."", ""Future perspectives"": ""A deeper understanding of the processes of gene expression in the intact cell nucleus will have a great impact on many aspects of biology, ranging from evolution to cell differentiation and neurobiology. It will also be essential for diagnosis and treatment in most disciplines of medicine. It is important to continue to identify and characterize processes and the involved individual components, probably with an emphasis on multi-molecular complexes and the dynamic changes of such complexes. The most important and, at the same time, most challenging area is how everything operates in the living cell. Knowledge about the compositional and conformational dynamics of complexes and their interactions must be studied in the perspective of functional importance for endogenous genes in intact cells. This goal is demanding and exciting, and will require that new methods are developed. Such methods should be able to map the interplay within and between RNA-protein and protein-protein complexes, including the temporal and spatial dimensions. As an example, it is already evident that the pre-mRNP, the processing machineries, and the chromatin are all in very close contact. It is desirable to learn which interactions are the functionally important ones. Furthermore, we need to know more about how various components are recruited to sites of action and thereafter recycled, in the intact cell. ""}",Integration of mRNP formation and export,"Expression of protein-coding genes in eukaryotes relies on the coordinated action of many sophisticated molecular machineries. Transcription produces precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) and the active gene provides an environment in which the pre-mRNAs are processed, folded, and assembled into RNA–protein (RNP) complexes. The dynamic pre-mRNPs incorporate the growing transcript, proteins, and the processing machineries, as well as the specific protein marks left after processing that are essential for export and the cytoplasmic fate of the mRNPs. After release from the gene, the mRNPs move by diffusion within the interchromatin compartment, making up pools of mRNPs. Here, splicing and polyadenylation can be completed and the mRNPs recruit the major export receptor NXF1. Export competent mRNPs interact with the nuclear pore complex, leading to export, concomitant with compositional and conformational changes of the mRNPs. We summarize the integrated nuclear processes involved in the formation and export of mRNPs.",10.1007/s00018-017-2503-3,Medline; PMC,PMC5501912,28314893.0,cc-by,2017-03-17,Cell Mol Life Sci,,,,27486197.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-017-2503-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28314893/,2017.0,paper

This 70-year-old asymptomatic man from La Rioja, Spain, underwent 18 F-FDG PET/CT for initial staging of Hodgkin lymphoma. His diagnostic workup included contrast-enhanced CT, followed by 18 F-FDG PET/CT, with both examinations reported together. He had no clinical evidence for COVID-19 infection including no known risk contacts. At the time of this writing, La Rioja region had one of Spain's highest COVID-19 incidence rates, with more than 1500 positive tests per 100,000 inhabitants, followed closely by Madrid with over 900 per 100,000 inhabitants. 1 18 F-FDG PET/CT was performed following the European Association of Nuclear Medicine procedure guidelines. 2 MIP images (A) showed bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy with abnormal 18 F-FDG uptake, predominantly in the left side (SUV max , 9.0). The right lower lung (arrow, A) had ill-defined low-grade activity (SUV max , 2.4). On CT (B), there were bilateral tree-in-bud opacities and several peripheral and subpleural ground-glass opacities (GGO), predominantly in the right lung (arrows). These showed mild activity on axial PET (arrows, C). GGOs have been reported as a primary CT findings in COVID-19, 3, 4 whereas pleural effusions and the tree-in-bud sign are atypical in COVID-19, possibly related to complications (pleural effusions) or superadded bacterial infection (tree-in-bud sign). 4, 5 Although the patient was asymptomatic, with no fever or cough, his CT findings were suspicious for COVID-19. The same day as the PET/CT, a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test had negative results for COVID-19 virus (also named \""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\"" or SARS-CoV-2). 6 Same day chest radiography was negative, and blood tests showed normal lymphocytes (19.5%), D-dimer (<200 \u03bcg/L), and LDH (115 U/L). Microbiological studies were negative for pneumococcus, legionella, and respiratory viruses. Given the high clinical suspicion for COVID-19, the patient was immediately isolated, and a repeat RT-PCR at 72 hours was positive for COVID-19. Repeat laboratory tests showed high IL-6 (4.4 pg/mL) and ferritin (1433 ng/mL), with normal D-dimer (<200 \u03bcg/L), lymphocytes, and LDH (127). He was treated for COVID-19 with paracetamol and hydroxychloroquine sulphate (dolquine), plus omeprazole, enoxaparin, furosemide, azithromycin, and tranxilium. One week after diagnosis, the patient remained asymptomatic, with no respiratory impairment. Recent reports have focused on lung CT findings in COVID-19. 3, 4, 7 Four COVID-19 patients scanned with 18 F-FDG PET/CT showed increased 18 F-FDG activity in GGOs associated with COVID-19. 8 CT findings are not part of the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19, and CT should not be relied upon for the initial diagnosis. Currently, RT-PCR has a key role in determining patient hospitalization and isolation, although its sensitivity is imperfect, with potentially long processing times in many settings. In this scenario, CT findings have been used as a surrogate for early detection in suspicious cases. CT may also demonstrate disease evolution and treatment effects. In our patient with initial staging of Hodgkin lymphoma and asymptomatic lung infection, CT suggested the diagnosis of unsuspected COVID-19, preceding RT-PCR confirmation by several days. Low 18 F-FDG activity in his GGOs may represent relatively low disease virulence.""}",(18)F-FDG PET/CT in Hodgkin Lymphoma With Unsuspected COVID-19,"We present an asymptomatic 70-year-old man referred for an (18)F-FDG PET/CT for initial staging of a Hodgkin lymphoma.

"", ""Introduction"": ""A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, which is considered to be associated with a market in Wuhan, China, is now affecting a number of countries worldwide 1, 2 . A substantial number of human-to-human transmission has occurred; the basic reproduction number R 0 (the average number of secondary transmissions caused by a single primary case in a fully susceptible population) has been estimated around 2-3 3-5 . More than 100 countries have observed confirmed cases of COVID-19. A few countries have already been shifting from the containment phase to the mitigation phase 6,7 , with a substantial number of locally acquired cases (including those whose epidemiological link is untraceable). On the other hand, there are countries where a number of imported cases were ascertained but fewer secondary cases have been reported than might be expected with an estimated value of R 0 of 2-3.This suggests that not all symptomatic cases cause a secondary transmission, which was also estimated to be the case for past coronavirus outbreaks (SARS/MERS) 8,9 . High individual-level variation (i.e. overdispersion) in the distribution of the number of secondary transmissions, which can lead to so-called superspreading events, is crucial information for epidemic control 9 . High variation in the distribution of secondary cases suggests that most cases do not contribute to the expansion of the epidemic, which means that containment efforts that can prevent superspreading events have a disproportionate effect on the reduction of transmission.We estimated the level of overdispersion in COVID-19 transmission by using a mathematical model that is characterised by R 0 and the overdispersion parameter k of a negative binomial branching process. We fit this model to worldwide data on COVID-19 cases to estimate k given the reported range of R 0 and interpret this in the context of superspreading."", ""Data source"": ""We extracted the number of imported/local cases in the affected countries (Table 1 ) from the WHO situation report 38 10 published on 27 February 2020, which was the latest report of the number of imported/local cases in each country (as of the situation report 39, WHO no longer reports the number of cases stratified by the site of infection). As in the WHO situation reports, we defined imported cases as those whose likely site of infection is outside the reporting country and local cases as those whose likely site of infection is inside the reporting country. Those whose site of infection was under investigation were excluded from the analysis (Estonia had no case with a known site of infection and was excluded). In Egypt and Iran, no imported cases have been confirmed, which cause the likelihood value to be zero; data in these two countries were excluded. To distinguish between countries with and without an ongoing outbreak, we extracted daily case counts from an online resource 11 and determined the dates of the latest case confirmation for each country (as of 27 February)."", ""Model"": ""Assuming If the observed case counts are part of an ongoing outbreak in a country, cluster sizes may grow in the future. To address this issue, we adjusted the likelihood for those countries with ongoing outbreak by only using the condition that the final cluster size of such a country has to be larger than the currently observed number of cases. The corresponding likelihood function is )."", ""Statistical analysis"": ""Varying the assumed R 0 between 0-5 (fixed at an evenlyspaced grid of values), we estimated the overdispersion parameter k using the likelihood function described above.We used the Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to provide 95% credible intervals (CrIs). The reciprocal of k was sampled where the prior distribution for the reciprocal was weakly-informed half-normal (HalfNormal(\u03c3 = 10)). We employed the adaptive hit-and-run Metropolis algorithm 13 and obtained 500 thinned samples from 10,000 MCMC steps"", ""Amendments from Version 1"": ""We have added a few clarifications in response to the reviewers' comments. We have also included a sensitivity analysis in Extended data, in which we assumed that the reproduction number of imported cases may be lower than that of local cases due to interventions. Although the estimated value of k was slightly higher under this assumption, it did not change our overall conclusion.Any further responses from the reviewers can be found at the end of the article (where the first half of the chain was discarded as burn-in). We confirmed that the final 500 samples have an effective sample size of at least 300, indicating sufficiently low auto-correlation.We also performed a joint-estimation of R 0 and k by the MCMC method (with a weakly-informed normal prior N(\u03bc = 3, \u03c3 = 5) for R 0 and the weakly-informed half-normal prior (HalfNormal(\u03c3 = 10)) for the reciprocal of k.Statistical analysis was implemented in R-3.6.1 with a package {LaplacesDemon}-16.1.1. The reproducible code for this study is available on GitHub 14 .Proportion responsible for 80% of secondary transmissions Using the estimated R 0 and k, we computed the estimated proportion of infected individuals responsible for 80% of the total secondary transmissions. Such proportion p 80% is given asrepresents the probability mass of a negative-binomial distribution with a mean R 0 and an overdispersion parameter k. This calculation is eased by the following rearrangement:We computed p 80% for each MCMC (Markov-chain Monte Carlo) sample to yield median and 95% CrIs."", ""Model comparison with a Poisson branching process model"": ""To test if our assumption of overdispersed offspring distribution better describes the data, we compared our negative-binomial branching process model with a Poisson branching process model, which assumes that the offspring distribution follows a Poisson distribution instead of negative-binomial. Since a negative-binomial distribution converges to a Poisson distribution as k \u2192 \u221e, we approximately implemented a Poisson branching process model by fixing k of the negative-binomial model at 10 10 . We compared the two models by the widelyapplicable Bayesian information criterion (WBIC) 15 ."", ""Simulation of the effect of underreporting"": ""We used simulations to investigate potential bias caused by underreporting, one of the major limitations of the present study. Underreporting in some countries may be more frequent than others because of limited surveillance and/or testing capacity, causing heterogeneity in the number of cases that could have affected the estimated overdispersion. See Extended data (Supplementary materials) 16 for detailed methods.The effect of a differential reproduction number for imported cases Due to interventions targeting travellers (e.g. screening and quarantine), the risk of transmission from imported cases may be lower than that from local cases. As part of the sensitivity analysis in Extended data, we estimated k assuming that the reproduction number of imported cases is smaller than that of local cases."", ""Results"": ""Our estimation suggested substantial overdispersion (k << 1) in the offspring distribution of COVID-19 ( Figure 1A and Figure 2 ). Within the current consensus range of R 0 (2-3), k was estimated to be around 0.1 (median estimate 0.1; 95% CrI: 0.05-0.2 for R 0 = 2.5). For the R 0 values of 2-3, the estimates suggested that 80% of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction of infectious individuals (~10%; Figure 1B ).The result of the joint estimation suggested the likely bounds for R 0 and k (95% CrIs: R 0 1.4-12; k 0.04-0.2). The upper bound of R 0 did not notably differ from that of the prior distribution (=13.5), suggesting that our model and the data only informed the lower bound of R 0 . This was presumably because the contribution of R 0 to the shape of a negative-binomial distribution is marginal when k is small (Extended data, Figure S1 ) 16 . A scatterplot (Extended data, Figure S2 ) 16 exhibited a moderate correlation between R 0 and k (correlation coefficient -0.4).Model comparison between negative-binomial and Poisson branching process models suggested that a negative-binomial model better describes the observed data; WBIC strongly supported the negative-binomial model with a difference of 11.0 ( Table 2 ). The simulation of the effect of underreporting suggested that possible underreporting is unlikely to cause underestimation of overdispersion parameter k (Extended data, Figure S3 ) 16 . A slight increase in the estimate of k was observed when the reproduction number for imported cases was assumed to be lower due to interventions (Extended data, Table S1 )."", ""Discussion"": ""Our results suggested that the offspring distribution of COVID-19 is highly overdispersed. For the likely range of R 0 of 2-3, the overdispersion parameter k was estimated to be around 0.1, suggesting that the majority of secondary transmission may be caused by a very small fraction of individuals (80% of transmissions caused by ~10% of the total cases). These results are consistent with a number of observed superspreading events observed in the current COVID-19 outbreak 17 , and also in line with the estimates from the previous SARS/MERS outbreaks 8 .The overdispersion parameter for the current COVID-19 outbreak has also been estimated by stochastic simulation 18 and from contact tracing data in Shenzhen, China 19 . The former study did not yield an interpretable estimate of k due to the limited data input. In the latter study, the estimates of R e (the effective reproduction number) and k were 0.4 (95% confidence interval: 0.3-0.5) and 0.58 (0.35-1.18), respectively, which did not agree with our findings. However, these estimates were obtained from pairs of cases with a clear epidemiological link and therefore may have been biased (downward for R 0 and upward for k) if superspreading events had been more likely to be missed during the contact tracing.Although cluster size distributions based on a branching process model are useful in inference of the offspring distribution from limited data 12,20 , they are not directly applicable to an ongoing outbreak because the final cluster size may not yet have been observed. In our analysis, we adopted an alternative approach which accounts for possible future growth of clusters to minimise the risk of underestimation. As of 27 February 2020, the majority of the countries in the dataset had ongoing outbreaks (36 out of 43 countries analysed, accounting for 2,788 cases of the total 2,816). Even though we used the case counts in those countries only as the lower bounds of future final cluster sizes, which might have only partially informed of the underlying branching process, our model yielded estimates with moderate uncertainty levels (at least sufficient to suggest that k may be below 1). Together with the previous finding suggesting that the overdispersion parameter is unlikely to be biased downwards 21 , we believe our analysis supports the possibility of highly-overdispersed transmission of COVID-19.A number of limitations need to be noted in this study. We used the confirmed case counts reported to WHO and did not account for possible underreporting of cases. Heterogeneities between countries in surveillance and intervention capacities, which might also be contributing to the estimated overdispersion, were not considered (although we investigated such effects by simulations; see Extended data, Figure S3 ) 16 . Reported cases whose site of infection classified as unknown, which should in principle be counted as either imported or local cases, were excluded from analysis. Some cases with a known site of infection could also have been misclassified (e.g., cases with travel history may have been infected locally). The distinction between countries with and without ongoing outbreak (7 days without any new confirmation of cases) was arbitrary. However, we believe that our conclusion is robust because the distinction does not change with different thresholds (4-14 days), within which the serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to fall 22,23 .Our finding of a highly-overdispersed offspring distribution suggests that there is benefit to focusing intervention efforts on superspreading. As most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of transmission, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare superspreading events. Identifying characteristics of settings that could lead to superspreading events will play a key role in designing effective control strategies.

The analysis is well executed. The manuscript is well written and the results are clearly presented. However, the data used in the study may have a few potential bias representing several alternative scenarios that I recommend the authors to explore:The number of imported cases is likely an underestimate of the true number of cases as screening of travelers is unlikely to reach high detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 .

In our sensitivity analysis, we explored how the estimated value of k may be biased with different probabilities of reporting. We found that the same level of underreporting for both imported and local cases tend to result in overestimation of k, while the estimate was hardly affected if the imported cases are fully reported but the local cases are underreported. As the scenario suggested by the reviewer may likely to lie in between these two extreme scenarios we explored, we expect that such scenario would lead to the overestimation of k (but not as much as our \""equally underreported\"" scenario; Figure S3A ).2. The over-dispersion estimated for SARS in the previous study is under un-controlled epidemic scenario. However, for imported cases detected through travel screening, certain control measures is likely in-place such as isolation/quarantine, which will reduce the effective reproduction number, thus in Figure 1 , the effective R0 range for imported cases could extend to <1.> We have included the suggested scenario as part of our sensitivity analysis. Assuming that R0 for local cases is 2.5, we varied the effective reproduction number for the imported cases (0.5, 0.8 and 1.2) and estimated the value of k. We found that the estimates of k were larger than those in our baseline analysis for R0 = 2.5 if the assumed reproduction number for the imported cases (R ) was below 1 (k = 0.3 for R = 0.5; k = 0.2 for R = 0.8). For R = 1.2, the estimate was similar to our baseline analysis (k = 0.1). We have added the description of this additional analysis in the supplementary document."", ""It's also quite likely that local transmission is heavily under-reported during February as well.

Assuming the average infection fatality 1% for the initial deaths may be subject to bias because the earliest cases may have specific age profiles that result in a different fatality. However, when averaged over the dataset, the overall case fatality may suggest the possible degree of underreporting in the dataset. As the mean lags of 8-13 days from case confirmation to death have been used for early outbreaks in existing studies [1, 2] , we referred to the WHO situation report 45 (5 March) and 52 (12 March), published on the 7 and 14 day from the situation report 38 we used in the analysis [3, 4] . The total number of deaths in the countries included in our analysis was 168 and 1,065, respecctively. Given 2,815 total confirmed cases as of February 27 , these suggest ascertainment ratios of 16.8% and 2.6%, respectively (assuming the true infection fatality risk is 1%). However, these ratios may be underestimates because of the rapid growth in both cases and deaths. It was suggested that the lag distribution from confirmation to death has a large variation (coefficient of variation 50%-100% [1,2]), and early-reported deaths from the cases confirmed later than February 27 may have inflated the number of deaths in situation reports 45 and 52. In either case, we believe that the assumed reporting probability in our sensitivity analysis ( Figure S3C ) was consistent overall with these observations. Although we did not include the above calculation in the manuscript because it is only a rough estimation in which we are not completely confident, we cited Niehus et al. to show that our assumed range of the reporting inferred results be different? This manuscript might be useful to understand the effect of continuous seeding: Characterizing the dynamics underlying global spread of epidemics .3. As to the statistical model, it seems that the authors assumed that all imported cases arrived and triggered the local epidemic at the same time. If the cases arrived at different time points, will the inferred results be different? This manuscript might be useful to understand the effect of continuous seeding: Characterizing the dynamics underlying global spread of epidemics.> We agree with the reviewer that continuous seeding is an important issue in time-series epidemic analysis. However, our approach was not sensitive to the assumption that all the imported cases arrived at the same point in time. Because we only imposed the condition that the final cluster size has to be at least the size of the currently observed number of cases, the temporal distribution of the imported cases does not change the likelihood function we used.No competing interests were disclosed. Competing Interests:"", ""Richard Falk"": ""When countries have mitigations in place including wearing masks, this lowers the probability of transmission events from the more casual contacts and shifts the likelihood to more crowded close-contact indoor poor air exchange environments where they were always risky but now represent the main situations that exceed the \""probability gate\"" limited by mask-wearing and physical distancing elsewhere. That is, . there is a bias towards super-spreading events Also, when countries put mitigations in place this shifts the probability of transmission to be more with those infected individuals with higher viral load (not necessarily measured in NP swabs but viral load where it counts in the lungs bringing virus-laden mucus to the vocal folds and epiglottis) or higher droplet/aerosol output because those with moderate viral load have much lower transmission such as from wearing masks or maintaining physical distancing. That is, there is a bias towards super-spreader . individuals This latter point requires a more subtle and complex analysis because it also requires non-linear limits on super-spreading individuals and these exist in the form of 1) the dose-response curve that flattens towards 100% probability of infection (i.e. you cannot infect someone more than once --that is, you can't count your very high viral load as infecting them three times as much) and 2) the limited number of contacts an individual has during the contagious period. So as mitigations are removed, the super-spreading individuals infect at a relative lower proportional rate than moderate viral-load individuals --that is, if the moderate viral-load individuals doubled in their R value when taking off their masks, the super-spreading individuals would be less than doubled (i.e. they are saturating in both the dose-response and opportunities). This means that the estimated \""k\"" value would be higher during the unmitigated exponential growth phase of disease transmission and this appears to be the case in China where most transmission was within of disease transmission and this appears to be the case in China where most transmission was within families. After mitigation and the more restrictive the mitigation, the lower the \""k\"" estimate would be because only those rarer individuals and events would occur and have one person infect many but have most of those infected not infect many others.So while it is reasonable to conclude that super-spreading individuals and/or super-spreader events are driving the majority of transmissions after mitigations are in place, it would be incorrect to conclude that this was (as much of) the situation when there were few mitigations . If mitigations are generally followed, then this can result in and there was wider community spread outbreaks that quickly die off unless the super-spreading individuals or events were numerous enough to create chains (i.e. if the R value of a super-spreading individual was more than 10 and they represent 10% of people who are infected then the overall R > 1 would continue the spread).It would also be good to be able to distinguish between super-spreader individuals vs. super-spreading events because the latter is more readily controlled via public policy by limiting crowds and requiring wearing masks. So far it appears that outbreaks are largely super-spreading events and while they could be caused from individuals with higher viral load there does not appear to be evidence of people wearing masks indoors maintaining social distance and having proper air exchange causing outbreaks."", ""No competing interests.

Animals and poultry of agricultural importance, including cows, pigs, and chickens, are infected by coronavirus strains that cause respiratory and enteric diseases of varying severity. In 2002-2003, SARS-CoV emerged from wildlife to cause an epidemic with a 10% case fatality ratio. Since then, two previously unknown HCoV, NL63 and HKU1, were discovered and found to cause respiratory disease worldwide. New molecular technologies for concurrently screening clinical specimens for a large number of viruses have allowed investigators to associate these newly identified coronaviruses with a wide range of respiratory diseases, from mild upper respiratory tract infections to severe pneumonia. Primary epithelial cell cultures derived from conducting airways have been studied as targets for several respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV. It is also important to understand the role of alveolar epithelial cells in initiating and regulating local immune responses to viral infection in the alveoli through the expression of cytokines and chemokines. Until recently, the responses of alveolar epithelial cells to virus infection were studied in continuous human or animal cell lines derived from the lung. However, these cell lines do not maintain the differentiated phenotypes of alveolar cells and thus, are not optimal models for the highly specialized cell types of the alveolar epithelium. Cell culture techniques that maintain the differentiated phenotypes of primary alveolar epithelial cells permit studies on the virus/ host interactions that influence immune responses to alveolar infection. Understanding the molecular details of these interactions will be critical for designing effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of respiratory virus infections."", ""RESPIRATORY CORONAVIRUS INFECTIONS"": ""The repiratory and enteric tracts are common targets for coronaviruses that infect animals and poultry, including pigs, cows, dogs, rodents, and chickens.

Bovine coronavirus causes disease in the enteric tract and the upper and lower respiratory tracts, which has been associated with shipping fever [3] . Infectious bronchitis virus causes a highly infectious respiratory disease in the upper respiratory tract and bronchi of chickens that is especially severe in chicks [3] . Canine respiratory coronavirus was discovered in 2003 and is prevalent worldwide in populations of kenneled dogs; however, its pathogenesis and contribution to kennel cough in dogs are incompletely understood [4, 5] . The murine coronavirus MHV-1 causes fatal interstitial pneumonitis in the A/J strain of inbred mice [6] . RCoV strains cause respiratory diseases with differing degrees of severity, depending on the viral strain and the age, strain, and immune status of the animal [7] [8] [9] .Five HCoV cause respiratory infections with various degrees of severity. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which were discovered in the 1960s, are a significant cause of common colds and can cause severe lower respiratory tract disease in elderly, infant, and immunocompromised patients [10 -13] . In 2003, SARS-CoV was identified as the causative agent of the epidemic of SARS [14, 15] . Subsequently, two additional HCoV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, were discovered to cause respiratory disease in patients worldwide [16 -19] . HCoV-NL63 is associated with mild upper respiratory tract infections, laryngotracheitis (croup), and bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children [17] [18] [19] . HCoV-HKU1 is also associated with upper respiratory tract infections in children and pneumonia in elderly patients with underlying diseases [10, 20] . Because of these findings, it is important to understand the mechanisms of coronaviral pathogenesis in the lung.Most coronaviruses, with the notable exception of bovine coronavirus, infect and cause disease in one species or a limited number of related species [21] . Although there are several animal models for SARS-CoV infection [22] , there are no animal models for respiratory diseases caused by the other four HCoV [23, 24] . Therefore, it is important to study these coronaviruses in differentiated human alveolar epithelial cells in vitro. However, it is desirable to study respiratory coronaviruses for which in vitro studies in differentiated alveolar cells can be correlated with pulmonary infection in vivo. Therefore, we are studying RCoV infection in its natural host as a model for pathogenesis of respiratory coronaviruses. The study of RCoV infection in rats provides an excellent model for understanding the innate immune responses of the alveoli to infection by a respiratory coronavirus of its natural host."", ""VIRAL INFECTION OF THE ALVEOLAR EPITHELIUM"": ""The alveolar epithelium consists of two morphologically and functionally distinct cell types [25] . Ninety-eight percent of the surface area of the alveolar epithelium is made up of AT1 cells, which are large, flattened, nondividing cells that function in gas exchange and fluid homeostasis [26, 27] . AT1 cells are identified in lung tissue by their morphology, specific binding to Ricinus communis 1 lectin, and expression of T1\u2423 and aqua-porin-5 [26] . AT2 cells are cuboidal, dividing cells and are progenitors for replacement of damaged AT1 cells [28] . AT2 cells produce surfactant lipids and proteins that keep the alveoli open and contribute to innate defense of the lung [29] . AT2 cells are distinguished in situ by binding to Maclura pomifera lectin, the presence of lamellar bodies, and expression of SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C [26, 29] . Infection of alveolar epithelial cells in vivo by respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, and SARS-CoV, can have significant effects on respiratory functions in the alveoli. Infection of AT1 cells can impair gas exchange and removal of fluid from the lung. In addition, infection of AT2 cells can compromise repair of the damaged alveolar epithelium and innate defense of the alveoli.In autopsy specimens from SARS patients, immunohistochemistry detected SARS-CoV antigens in AT1 or AT2 cells, or both cell types, as well as in alveolar macrophages and bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells [30 -33] . Differences in the cell types that contain viral antigen in different patients may reflect the age of the patient and/or the time after infection when the patient died. Studies on SARS-CoV infection in primate, murine, feline, and ferret models have also demonstrated infection of alveolar epithelial cells. SARS-CoV antigens were detected in AT1 cells of cynomolgus macaques 4 days after inoculation with SARS-CoV, at which time, there was diffuse alveolar damage and neutrophil infiltration in the lung [34] . van den Brand et al. [35] found SARS-CoV antigen predominantly in AT1 and AT2 cells of cats and AT2 cells of ferrets 4 days after inoculation with SARS-CoV, when all animals had diffuse alveolar damage with infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages. Although cats had no clinical signs of infection with SARS-CoV, ferrets inoculated with SARS-CoV were lethargic, and one of four ferrets died 4 days after inoculation. In aged mouse and mouse-adapted models of SARS, viral antigens were detected in alveolar epithelial cells without distinguishing AT1 from AT2 cells [36 -38] . In contrast to inoculation of young mice, inoculation of aged mice with SARS-CoV causes clinical signs of disease, lymphocyte infiltration, and alveolar damage 3-9 days after inoculation [37] . Despite these clinical and histopathological signs of disease, aged mice recover from infection. The mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) isolated by Roberts et al. [36] causes lethal infection in BALB/c mice, characterized by viral antigens in bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells with cellular necrosis and infiltration of mononuclear cells. A second mouse-adapted SARS isolate (F-musX-VeroE6) causes clinical signs of disease in BALB/c mice, with a 30% mortality rate [38] . Inoculation of adult mice with this virus results in viral antigen in alveolar epithelial cells, diffuse alveolar damage, and infiltration of macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils into the alveoli. Porcine respiratory coronavirus antigen has been identified by immunofluorescence in epithelial cells of the alveoli, bronchi, and bronchioli, as well as alveolar macrophages 2-6 days after inoculation of infant pigs, resulting in subclinical interstitial pneumonia [1] . RCoV infection of adult rats results in an influx of neutrophils, followed by lymphocytes and monocytes, into the respiratory tract [7, 39] . The interactions between respiratory vi-ruses and alveolar epithelial cells can mediate the innate immune response to virus infection in the lung. Primary cultures of differentiated alveolar epithelial cells are a valuable model for studying these interactions."", ""CORONAVIRUS ISOLATION OFTEN REQUIRES DIFFERENTIATED HOST CELLS"": ""Human respiratory coronaviruses could not be isolated from patients with colds in continuous human cell lines, but instead, virus isolation required serial blind passage in human diploid fibroblasts or human fetal tracheal organ cultures [40 -44] . HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 caused only mild cytopathic effects in these cells, but these viruses could be used to infect human volunteers to study the pathogenesis of coronavirus infection of the upper respiratory tract [41, 45] . HCoV-NL63 is also difficult to isolate from clinical specimens [46] and can be isolated most readily in primary, differentiated human airway epithelial cells [47] . Infectious HCoV-HKU1 has not yet been propagated in any cell culture, although its entire genome sequence has been determined [16] . In contrast, SARS-CoV could be readily isolated from patients in the Vero E6 line of monkey kidney cells or in fetal rhesus kidney cells [14, 48, 49] . The reasons for the fastidious requirements of most human respiratory coronaviruses for differentiated human respiratory epithelial cells are not yet understood."", ""CORONAVIRUS INFECTION IN PRIMARY DIFFERENTIATED RESPIRATORY EPITHELIAL CELLS"": ""The respiratory tract is lined with epithelial cells that have different functions in the upper respiratory tract (nasal and sinusoidal epithelium), conducting airways (tracheal and bronchial epithelium), and alveoli (alveolar epithelial cells), and all of these are susceptible to infection with a variety of respiratory viruses. Winther et al. [50] demonstrated the susceptibility of primary cultures of ciliated nasal epithelial cells to infection by HCoV-229E without cytopathic effects. Polarized cultures of differentiated, ciliated human conducting airway epithelia have also been used to study infection and the polarity of entry and release by HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and SARS-CoV [47, [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . These studies emphasize the importance of the differentiation state of ciliated cells for susceptibility to coronavirus infection [52, 53] . Recent advances in the cultivation of differentiated alveolar epithelial cells now allow analysis of these important cell types in virus infection."", ""CULTIVATION AND CORONAVIRUS INFECTION OF PRIMARY DIFFERENTIATED ALVEOLAR EPITHELIAL CELLS"": ""As continuous cell lines derived from alveolar epithelium do not maintain their differentiated characteristics, primary cultures must be used to study differentiated AT1 and AT2 cells in vitro. Primary AT1 cells are difficult to isolate to a high yield and purity and propagate [26] . However, AT2 cells can be readily isolated from lung tissue, and under special culture conditions, they maintain their AT2 phenotype. Under different culture conditions, AT2 cells transdifferentiate into an AT1 cell phenotype (Fig. 1) . This process of transdifferentiation occurs during repair of the alveolar epithelium in vivo and can be replicated in vitro [56 -61] . Primary rat AT2 cells maintain their differentiated phenotype when they are cultured on collagen/matrigel in medium containing 5% rat serum and KGF [62, 63] . The AT2 phenotype is characterized by a cuboidal shape, lipogenesis (evident by the presence of lamellar bodies) and expression of surfactant proteins. When rat AT2 cells are cultured for 3-5 days in 10% FBS without KGF, they lose properties of AT2 cells and transdifferentiate into an AT1 cell phenotype (tAT1 cell, also called AT1-like cell) [56, 58, 59] . These cells are flattened, express markers characteristic of AT1 cells in vivo (T1\u2423, aquaporin-5, and caveolin-1), and react with AT1 cell-specific antibodies and lectins [26, 59, 64 -68] . As the markers used to distinguish AT1 cells in situ are present in tAT1 cells in vitro, tAT1 cells are a practical alternative to AT1 cell isolation for the study of AT1 cells in vitro. As with any in vitro model, the biological relevance of such studies must ultimately be confirmed in vivo.We showed that the differentiation status of primary alveolar epithelial cells is critical in determining susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection [69] . Human alveolar epithelial cells that were maintained with the AT2 phenotype supported infection by SARS-CoV, whereas cells from the same donor that were transdifferentiated in vitro to a tAT1 cell phenotype were resistant to infection. In contrast to SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E replicates and causes cytopathic effects in cloned AT2 cells, which resemble an AT1 cell phenotype [70] . Our studies using RCoV infection of primary differentiated rat alveolar epithelial cells were the first to demonstrate coronavirus infection in tAT1 and AT2 cells in vitro [71, 72] ."", ""INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSES OF ALVEOLAR EPITHELIAL CELLS TO VIRUS INFECTION"": ""In the lung, the roles of AT2 cells and alveolar macrophages in initiating and regulating an immune response have been studied extensively. AT2 cells produce inflammatory mediators upon exposure to inhaled microbes or particles and regulate the functions of immune cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes in the lung [29, [73] [74] [75] . In vitro, human bronchial epithelial cells and AT2 cells produce cytokines and chemokines in response to infection with viruses including RSV, influenza A virus, and SARS-CoV [76 -80] . The innate immune functions of AT1 cells have only been recognized recently. Expression of chemokines by primary differentiated tAT1 cells in vitro is increased by exposure to IL-1\u2423, IL-1\u2424, or LPS [64, 65, 81, 82] . In primary cultures of murine tAT1 cells, influenza A virus induces expression of CCL2 and CCL5, resulting in transmigration of monocytes [83] .We have shown that rat tAT1 cells in vitro express cytokines and chemokines upon infection with RCoV [71] . This study was the first to show that virus infection of primary tAT1 cells induces a proinflammatory response. RCoV infection of tAT1 cells induces expression of cytokines, including GM-CSF, IFN-\u2425, and TNF-\u2423, and chemokines, predominantly those of the CXC family [71] . The primary functions of CXC chemokines are to recruit and activate neutrophils. We hypothesize that RCoV infection in the lung induces CXC chemokine expression by AT1 cells, which in turn, recruits neutrophils to the lung. The role of neutrophils during RCoV infection of the lung is unknown, but these cells may contribute to viral clearance and immunopathology. Rat tAT1 cells are a valuable model in which to study the virus/host interactions that regulate this response. Using this model, we showed that like RCoV infection, UV-inactivated RCoV induces CXC chemokine expression in rat tAT1 cells [71] , so virus replication is not required to induce the chemokine response in rat tAT1 cells. Dual immunolabeling of viral antigen and CXC chemokines in rat tAT1 cells showed that CXC chemokines are expressed predominantly from uninfected cells in the culture [71] . Therefore, expression of CXC chemokines during RCoV infection of tAT1 cells may be mediated by a paracrine mechanism. We found that RCoV-infected rat tAT1 cells treated with IL-1Ra had markedly decreased expression of CXC chemokines relative to cells without IL-1Ra [71] . Treatment with soluble TNFR protein did not affect chemokine expression by RCoV-infected tAT1 cells. Thus, signaling through the IL-1R likely mediates CXC chemokine expression by rat tAT1 cells during RCoV infection (Fig. 2) . As IL-1\u2423 and IL-1\u2424 signal through the IL-1R, either or both of these cytokines may contribute to CXC chemokine expression during RCoV infection of tAT1 cells. Manzer et al. [65, 82] showed that rIL-1\u2423 and rIL-1\u2424 induce expression of CXC chemokines by rat tAT1 cells in vitro. Rat tAT1 cells are a valuable model for investigating the early events in innate immune responses to respiratory coronavirus infections."", ""NEUTROPHILS IN RESPIRATORY VIRUS INFECTIONS"": ""Neutrophils infiltrate tissues early after viral infection and, through the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, can direct the subsequent recruitment of monocytes and lymphocytes. For example, in infants with RSV bronchiolitis, neutrophils accounted for 93% and 76% of inflammatory cells in the upper and lower airways, respectively [84, 85] ; however, the specific functions of neutrophils during RSV infection are unclear [86] . Neutrophils infiltrate the respiratory tract by 18 h after inoculation of mice with influenza A virus, and increased numbers of neutrophils have been associated with highly pathogenic influenza virus infections in mice [87, 88] . Depletion of neutrophils from mice exacerbated infection with a highly pathogenic recombinant influenza virus strain containing the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the 1918 influenza virus [87] . Thus, neutrophils can play a role in protection from virulent influenza virus infection. In infection with less virulent strains of influenza A virus, neutrophils can have a protective effect [89, 90] or no effect [91] on viral replication and pathogenesis. Thus, with different virus strains, neutrophils can have different functions in the innate immune response to respiratory infections. Neutrophils also infiltrate tissues infected by coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, RCoV, and MHV. A high neutrophil count in the blood of SARS patients at the time of hospital admission was associated with a poor prognosis [92, 93] . A mouse-adapted isolate of SARS-CoV (F-musX-VeroE6) causes lethal infection in adult, but not young, mice [38] . The disease severity in adult mice correlates with increased pulmonary inflammation consisting predominantly of neutrophils, which are also the predominant cell type detected in the nasal exudates from chickens infected with infectious bronchitis virus and are believed to contribute to disease pathology [94] . These findings suggest that neutrophils can contribute to immune-mediated pathology in some coronavirus infections. Infection of rats with RCoV results in infiltration of neutrophils to the respiratory tract early after inoculation, followed by the recruitment of macrophages and lymphocytes [7, 8, 39, 95] . Infection of mice with a neurotropic murine coronavirus, MHV-JHM, results in infiltration of neutrophils into the brain by 1 day after inoculation, which then promotes the recruitment of other types of inflammatory cells into the brain, likely through loss of the blood brain barrier [96] . Despite the presence of neutrophils in coronavirus-infected tissues, their role in the clearance and/or immunopathology of coronavirus infections is largely unknown. Future studies on the responses of neutrophils to RCoV-infected tAT1 cells in vitro may elucidate the role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of respiratory coronavirus infections. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS T.

Coronaviruses are being associated increasingly with severe diseases in the lower respiratory tract. Alveolar epithelial cells are an important target for coronavirus infection in the lung, and infected cells can initiate innate immune responses to viral infection. In this overview, we describe in vitro models of highly differentiated alveolar epithelial cells that are currently being used to study the innate immune response to coronavirus infection. We have shown that rat coronavirus infection of rat alveolar type I epithelial cells in vitro induces expression of CXC chemokines, which may recruit and activate neutrophils. Although neutrophils are recruited early in infection in several coronavirus models including rat coronavirus. However, their role in viral clearance and/or immune-mediated tissue damage is not understood. Primary cultures of differentiated alveolar epithelial cells will be useful for identifying the interactions between coronaviruses and alveolar epithelial cells that influence the innate immune responses to infection in the lung.

Coronaviruses have been divided into four genera based on antigenic and sequence comparisons (Siddell, 1995) . Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), one of the most extensively studied coronaviruses, is a 32 kb betacoronavirus (Britton, 2008) . Cells infected with MHV contain genomic RNA and six to seven subgenomic mRNAs that make up a 3\u2032 co-terminal nested set (Leibowitz et al., 1981; van der Born, 2008) . Analysis of deletion mutants of MHV defective interfering (DI) RNAs indicated that DI replication requires cis-acting elements located within the 3\u2032 terminal 436 nucleotides of the virus (Kim et al., 1993; Lin and Lai, 1993) . This 436 nts region extends upstream of the 301 nts 3\u2032 UTR into the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene. Subsequent studies demonstrated that in the context of the entire virus, the N protein gene can be moved to a different part of the genome with no effect on virus replication, implying that the 3\u2032 UTR contains all the 3\u2032 cis-acting sequences necessary for this process (de Haan et al., 2002; Goebel et al., 2004) .Multiple studies have been performed to determine the RNA secondary structures present in the 3\u2032UTR and their functional role in viral replication (Goebel et al., 2004 (Goebel et al., , 2007 Hsue et al., 2000; Hsue and Masters, 1997; Johnson et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2001 Liu et al., , 1997 Williams et al., 1999; Leibowitz, 1995a, 1995b; Zust et al., 2008) . Initial studies of the MHV 3\u2032UTR RNA secondary structure predicted three stem-loop structures in the 3\u2032-most 171 nts of the genome [excluding the poly(A) tail] (Yu and Leibowitz, 1995b) . Subsequently, the Hsue and Masters also examined the secondary structure of the 3\u2032UTR and predicted that the 5\u2032 68 nts of the 3\u2032 UTR folded into a bulged stem-loop required for viral replication (Hsue and Masters, 1997) . Biochemical studies supported this bulged stem-loop structure and suggested that it was necessary for RNA replication, although the terminal loop and the first internal loop near the base of the stem were found to be larger than originally thought (Hsue et al., 2000; Hsue and Masters, 1997) . Williams et al. (Williams et al., 1999) examined the 3\u2032UTR in bovine coronavirus and reported evidence for a phylogenetically conserved pseudoknot. This pseudoknot encompasses nts 238-185 (note that the 3\u2032-most nucleotide upstream of the poly(A) tail is position 1 in this numbering scheme, with numbers ascending in the 5\u2032 direction) in MHV, and its 5\u2032 stem overlaps with the last segment of the upstream bulged stem-loop (positions 301-224 in MHV), making the two secondary structures in part mutually exclusive. This led to the hypothesis that these two structures may be alternate conformers of the same region of genomic RNA and constitute a molecular switch (Hsue et al., 2000) . A genetic analysis using viral mutants isolated by targeted recombination supports this hypothesis (Goebel et al., 2004) . A study examining the secondary structure of the last 166 nucleotides of the 3\u2032UTR, a region downstream of the pseudoknot predicted a long multibranch stem loop in this region of the genome, a model that was largely supported by enzymatic probing of RNA secondary structure (Liu et al., 2001) . DI RNA replication assays supported a functional role for several stems in this structure. Subsequent reexamination of this data favored a somewhat different conformation for the last 42 nucleotides in the 3\u2032UTR (Johnson et al., 2005) . A series of DI RNA replication assays showed that mutations within this region (nts 42-1) that disrupted (ATW3\u2032 and ATW5\u2032) or restored (ATW) a predicted stem in this region prevented the accumulation of DI RNAs (Johnson et al., 2005) . When these same mutations (ATW, ATW3\u2032, and ATW5\u2032) were introduced into the 3\u2032 UTR of the complete viral genome, only the ATW mutation was lethal; viruses containing the ATW3\u2032 and ATW5\u2032 mutations grew almost as well as wild type virus in a one-step growth curve experiment although they did produce significantly smaller plaques than wild type (Johnson et al., 2005) . Goebel et al. (Goebel et al., 2007) demonstrated that a hyper variable bulged stem loop spanning nts 46-156 was not essential for MHV replication, even though this otherwise poorly conserved region contains a highly conserved octanucleotide sequence present in virtually all coronaviruses (Boursnell et al., 1985) , and proposed a secondary structure model of the complete MHV 3\u2032UTR (Goebel et al., 2004; Goebel et al., 2007) . Based in part on sequence co-variation, Zust et al. (Zust et al., 2008) subsequently revised the 3\u2032 region of this model (see Fig. 1 ) to reflect potential conserved base pairings present in viruses representing all three coronavirus subgroups. Although the phylogenetic conservation of the proposed secondary structural model is persuasive and suggests that the proposed secondary structures are functionally important, a genetic test of the functional importance of this structure was not performed.We report here a functional analysis of the RNA secondary structure model proposed by Zust et al. (Zust et al., 2008) . We utilized reverse genetic approaches to experimentally test this model through mutagenesis of the novel S3 and S4 stems (see Fig. 1 ) predicted by this model. Mutations opening up S3 were lethal, but large disruptions in S4 generated both viable and lethal mutants. Genomes carrying the original mutations in S3 or S4 plus compensatory mutations that restored base pairing in these stems were all viable and had robust growth phenotypes. Overall our results support the Zust model for the coronavirus 3\u2032UTR and suggest that the S3 stem is required for virus viability, whereas at least some mutations that disrupt the S4 stem can be tolerated."", ""Results"": ""Small disruptions of S3 or S4 have little effect on viral phenotype and negative-strand subgenomic RNA synthesisIn the Zust et al. model of the MHV 3\u2032UTR (Zust et al., 2008) , nucleotides 0 to 9 (note that the 5\u2032-most A of the poly(A) tail is designated as position 0) are base paired with the L1 loop of the pseudoknot to form a helical stem (labeled S3 in Fig. 1A) ; nucleotides 18-29 are base-paired (S4 in Fig. 1A ) with sequences downstream of the pseudoknot stem S2. In an earlier study of protein interacting sequences in the 3\u2032UTR (Johnson et al., 2005) , three mutations that mapped to S3 and/or S4 (see Fig. 1 ) in the Zust et al. model of the MHV 3\u2032UTR (Zust et al., 2008) were examined for their effects on replication. These mutations, originally named ATW3\u2032, ATW5\u2032, and ATW (Johnson et al., 2005) have been renamed as A, B, and AB in the current study to increase clarity (see Fig. 1B and C). When these three mutations are introduced into the genomic RNA, genomes containing the A and B mutations lead to viable viruses, however, the genome containing the AB mutation is lethal (Johnson et al., 2005) . Based on our earlier results with the A, B, and AB mutants we hypothesized that the presence of either of the two stems is sufficient for a viable virus, but disruption of both stems is lethal. To investigate this hypothesis and to perform a genetic test of the Zust secondary structure model of the 3\u2032UTR, we made a series of additional mutations targeting S3 and S4. Mutations C and D, were designed to destabilize S3 and S4 respectively; mutation CD destabilizes both S3 and S4 (Fig. 1B) . Mutations that affected both sides of S3 and S4 were designated ABD, ABC, and ABCD (Fig. 1C) . When mutations C, D, ABC, and ABD, which destabilize base-pairing in either the S3 (D, ABC) or S4 (C, ABD) helices were introduced into the genomic RNA, they all produced viable virus with somewhat smaller plaque sizes compared to the wild type virus ( Fig. 2A) , grew with near identical kinetics to wild type virus, and achieved peak titers that were at least 25% of those achieved by wild type virus (Fig. 2B ). However, for genomes carrying mutation CD, a mutation which disrupts basepairing in both S3 and S4, we were unable to recover virus in multiple trials, thus we concluded that this mutation was lethal, similar to the results we obtained with the A, B, and AB mutations in our previous work (Johnson et al., 2005) . Furthermore, when mutant ABCD, which restores base-pairing in stems S3 and S4 but alters the sequences of these stems, was introduced into the genomic RNA it was viable and generated a virus that forms plaques almost identical in size to those formed by wild type virus, grew with nearly identical kinetics to wild type virus, and achieved a peak titer nearly identical to that of wild type virus ( Fig. 2A and B ). These results are entirely consistent with the Zust model (Zust et al., 2008) of the 3\u2032UTR and our hypothesis that base-pairing in either S3 or S4 are necessary for MHV viability.We had previously demonstrated that MHV genomes carrying the lethal AB mutation are unable to direct the synthesis of subgenomic RNA, although they are able to direct the synthesis of a minus sense complement of the genome (Johnson et al., 2005) . To determine the RNA species that might have been generated in cells electroporated with genomes containing the CD mutation, we performed nested RT-PCR assays to detect negative-strand genomic RNA and negativestrand subgenomic RNA3 and mRNA6. These RNAs serve as templates for genomic and subgenomic mRNA synthesis (Pasternak et al., 2003; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990; Sola et al., 2005; Zuniga et al., 2004) . Nested RT-PCR results showed that negative-strand genomic RNAs were present in cells at 4 and 8 h after electroporation with in vitro transcribed genomes carrying the CD mutation, similar to what we observed after electroporation of WT genomes (Fig. 2C ). In contrast, neither negative-strand subgenomic RNA3 nor RNA6 were detected in cells electroporated with in vitro transcribed genomes carrying the CD mutation, whereas cells electroporated with WT genomes contained negative-strand subgenomic RNA3 and RNA6 at 8 h incubation ( Fig. 2D and E). For each sample, parallel RT-PCR reactions without an RT step were performed to ensure that residual DNA templates taken up by the cells during electroporation did not produce PCR signals (data not shown). These data show that genomes carrying the CD mutation destabilizing stems S3 and S4 are defective in directing subgenomic RNA synthesis, the identical phenotype detected with the AB mutations on the opposing sides of the stem in our previous work (Johnson et al., 2005) ."", ""Larger disruptions of S3 or S4 generate various viral phenotypes"": ""Based on the above results, we further tested if larger sequence disruptions in S3 or S4 affect virus viability. A series of mutants E, F, G, H, EH, and FG were made for this purpose (Fig. 3) . Mutations E and H, two mutants that completely disrupt S3, were lethal; a mutation in the 5\u2032 side of S4 that completely disrupted this stem, mutation G, produced the same lethal phenotype. However, the mutation in the 3\u2032 side of S4, mutation F, produced a viable virus. All plaque isolates of F mutant virus, from two independent electroporations, also contained a second site mutation, either A5/C5 or A6/C6. C5 or C6 can base-pair with G221 which is extruded in the WT S3 stem; this base-pairing increased the stability of S3 in viruses we recovered containing the F mutation. Sequencing of the nsp8 and nsp9 coding regions of these mutants failed to reveal additional second site mutations. Unsurprisingly, mutations that restored the S3 and S4 helices, mutations EH and FG, both generated viable mutants viruses EH and FG. These viable mutants have smaller plaque sizes, but essentially equivalent onestep growth curve compared to wild type virus ( Fig. 4A and C) . RNA species present in cells electroporated with the lethal G and H mutants were analyzed by RT-PCR as described above for the AB and CD lethal mutants; negative sense genomic RNAs were detected when cells were electroporated with genomes containing the lethal mutants H in S3 and G in S4; however, subgenomic RNA synthesis is defective in these mutants ( Fig. 4D and E) . These results suggest that S3 is critical for virus viability, with complete disruption of S3 leading to a defect in subgenomic RNA synthesis and thus a lethal phenotype. The disparate effects of the F (viable), G (lethal), and FG (viable) mutations in S4 led us to model the possible effects of these three mutations on the overall folding of this portion of the 3\u2032UTR in Mfold. The Mfold models suggest that the G mutant has the potential to fold into a very different structure than the wild type structure but with a similar thermodynamic stability, perhaps accounting for the G mutant's lethal phenotype. In contrast the F mutation is predicted to simply result in local unfolding of S4. This suggests that S4 is not essential for virus viability.Disruption of L3 has no effect on viral phenotypesThe 8 nts that make up loop 3 (L3, see Fig. 1A and Fig. 3 ) have a perfect palindromic sequence arrangement and led us to investigate the role of L3, if any, in viral replication. Three mutations, a loop randomized mutation (LRD), a mutation that shortened L3 by Zust et al. (2008) , including the region downstream of S2 comprised of the HVR and the two helical stem structures (S3 and S4). (B) Mutations made to locally disrupt S3 and S4. The C and D mutations were made in this study and the A and B were previously made by Johnson et al. (2005) . The wild type sequence is shown and the nucleotides that are altered by mutation italicized. Arrows indicate the sequence of each mutant. (C) Mutated nucleotides are indicated by italicized lower case letters.2-nts (LST2), and a mutation that shortened L3 by 6-nts (LST6), were designed to test the functional role of L3 (Fig. 3) . Interestingly, these mutations all resulted in viable viruses with only minor differences in plaque size and no differences in their replication kinetics or final titer compared to wild type virus ( Fig. 4B and C) . This result showed that L3 likely functions as a linker between S3 and S4 with few constraints on its sequence and length."", ""Discussion"": ""Cis-acting sequences important for controlling viral replication are typically found in the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTRs of RNA viruses. RNA secondary structural features are often important in the function of these cis-acting regions. In this study we have performed a functional analysis of the RNA secondary structural model of the MHV 3\u2032UTR originally proposed by Zust et al. (Zust et al., 2008) utilizing a reverse genetics approach. The conservation amongst group 2 coronaviruses of the structural elements of the 3\u2032UTR, namely the bulged stem-loop and overlapping pseudoknot and the conserved S3 and S4 helices connected by a variable length loop (see Fig. 1A ) (Zust et al., 2008) , and the ability of other group 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV and BCoV) 3\u2032UTRs with primary sequences that diverge significantly from MHV to functionally replace the MHV 3\u2032UTR (Goebel et al., 2004; Hsue and Masters, 1997; Kang et al., 2006) , suggests the RNA secondary structure of the 3\u2032UTR plays a key functional role in coronavirus replication. The overlap of the most distal portion of the bulged stem-loop with the pseudoknot makes these two structures mutually exclusive. This led to the hypothesis that these two structures may be alternate conformations of the same region of genomic RNA and constitute a molecular switch (Hsue et al., 2000) . Genetic studies demonstrated that both the pseudoknot and base-pairing of the lower region of the bulged-stem-loop were functionally important, supporting this hypothesis (Goebel et al., 2004) . Biophysical studies (Stammler et al., 2011) demonstrate that the pseudoknotted conformation is much less stable than the doublehairpin conformation but suggest that stacking of the pseudoknot with the S3 helix can stabilize the pseudoknotted conformation allowing it to form. Mutations predicted to disrupt the S3 helix, (mutations E and H) were both lethal, whereas the double mutation EH predicted to restore the S3 helix, resulted in a viable virus, consistent with the idea that this stem may be necessary to allow the pseudoknotted conformation to form, or is necessary for viral replication in its own right.Mutations in S4 predicted to disrupt this helix had differing effects. Mutation G, in the 5\u2032 side of S4 and predicted to completely disrupt the S4 helix produced a lethal phenotype. This contrasted with the mutation in the 3\u2032 side of the S4 helix, mutation F, which reproducibly produced a viable virus with a second site mutation in the S3 helix that stabilized this structure. The double mutant FG, predicted to restore the predicted structure, resulted in a viable virus, entirely consistent with the Zust (Zust et al., 2008) model. Modeling the possible effects of these three mutations on the overall folding of this portion of the 3\u2032UTR in Mfold, suggests that the G mutant has the potential to cause the region containing the triple helix junction (S2, S3, and S4, see Fig. 1 ) to fold into a completely different two helix structure with a similar thermodynamic stability as the wild type structure. This structure, lacking the S2 stem-loop and both the S3 and S4 helices, would not be able to form the pseudoknotted structure or the double stem-loop structure (extended bulged stem-loop plus S2-L2 stem-loop), likely accounting for the G mutant's lethal phenotype. In contrast the F mutation is predicted to simply result in local unfolding of S4. All of the viruses we recovered with the F mutation in S4 also contained second site A5C or A6C mutations in S3 that resulted in a G-C base pair replacing an A-U base pair, thus increasing in the stability of S3 by a small amount. Our failure to recover viruses that contain the F mutation without any second site mutations, raises the possibility that S4 interacts (stacks) with the S3 helix, making a further necessary contribution to the stability of the 3\u2032 UTR, particularly in the pseudoknotted configuration.Mutations with smaller sequence disruptions designed to separately destabilize the predicted S3 (mutations A, D, ABC) or S4 (mutations B, C, and ABD) helical stems were all viable, whereas mutants that destabilized both of these helices (mutations AB and CD) were lethal. A quadruple mutation (ABCD) that maintained both S3 and S4 while altering the sequences of these stems yielded a virus with an in vitro phenotype virtually identical to that of wild type virus. These results strongly support the Zust (Zust et al., 2008) model. Modeling the possible effects of the lethal AB and CD mutations on the overall folding of this portion of the 3\u2032UTR in Mfold, suggests that the CD mutant has only one thermodynamically stable conformation in which the region containing the triple helix junction (S2, S3, and S4, see Fig. 1 ) folds into a completely different structure consisting of a long bulged stem-loop linked to a shorter bulged stem-loop by a seven nucleotide single-stranded linker. This structure, lacking the S2-L2 stem-loop and both the S3 and S4 helices, would not be able to form the pseudoknotted structure or the alternative two stem-loop structure that make up the putative molecular switch (Goebel et al., 2004) , possibly accounting for the CD mutant's lethal phenotype. It is less clear from our modeling of the AB mutant why it is lethal. The three structures predicted by Mfold all maintain the S2-L2 stem-loop with the most stable predicted structure containing an additional bulge in S4 and a somewhat reconfigured and shorter S3 helix (see Fig. 1 ). These same altered S3 and S4 helices are predicted to be present singly in the A and B mutants, thus the predicted structure of the AB mutant does not provide a ready explanation for its lethal phenotype. It is also possible that the lethal AB and CD mutations perturb the equilibrium between the extended bulged stem-loop structure and the pseudoknotted structure to a degree that is incompatible with viability.Mutations disrupting the L3 loop (LRD, LST2, and LST6) between S3 and S4 were all viable with no apparent phenotypic differences compared to wild type virus. This leads us to conclude that L3 might function as a linker between S3 and S4 with little sequence and length preference. Overall, the genetic studies of the 3\u2032UTR strongly support the Zust model. Several alternative secondary structures for this region of the 3\u2032UTR were proposed prior to the development of the current model. (Goebel et al., 2007; Johnson et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2001) . Our results suggest that it is unlikely that these alternative RNA secondary structures have a functional role in replication and support the Zust model of the 3\u2032 UTR (Zust et al., 2008) . Zust et al. (Zust et al., 2008) introduced insertion mutations in the loop 1 (L1) sequence on the 5\u2032 side of the S3 stem and recovered second site suppressor mutations in the nsp8 and nsp9 proteins in viruses recovered after limited passage. Based on these results these authors speculated that the L1 loop plus the S3 helix might serve as a binding site for a primase complex containing the nsp8 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity (Imbert et al., 2006) , and that this complex initiates minus sense RNA synthesis. In this model, once RNA synthesis had commenced from the 3\u2032 end of the genome the base pairing in S3 would be disrupted, allowing formation of the upstream pseudoknot (see Fig. 1 ), enabling assembly of a complete replicase complex containing the nsp12 RNA RdRp and other nsps to subsequently elongate the RNA primer. Sequencing of the nsp8 and nsp9 coding sequences of viable mutant viruses A, D, and ABC, all containing mutations predicted to disrupt a small portion of the S3 helix, failed to demonstrate second site suppressor mutations in nsp8 and nsp9 (data not shown). Similarly, sequencing of this region in all mutant F isolates failed to demonstrate second site mutations. Additionally, the RNA phenotype of all of the lethal mutations that we examined (AB, CD, H, and G; Figs. 2C and 4E) indicated that genomes with these mutations were able to direct the synthesis of negative sense RNAs corresponding to the genome but were not able to synthesize negative sense templates for subgenomic RNA synthesis. This result is generally consistent with a model for subgenomic RNA synthesis (Sola et al., 2005; Zuniga et al., 2004) that hypothesized that genome circularization mediated by RNAprotein or RNA-RNA interactions plays an important role in leaderbody sequence joining during transcription of minus sense subgenomic RNAs, providing a role for the 3\u2032UTR in subgenomic RNA synthesis. It should be noted that the Zust (Zust et al., 2008) and Zuniga/Sola (Sola et al., 2005; Zuniga et al., 2004) models are not necessarily mutually exclusive and elements of both of them could explain the observed RNA phenotype of our mutants. Our data does not distinguish between these two models, but it does demonstrate that in either scenario the complex and very likely dynamic structure of the 3\u2032UTR is necessary for discontinuous synthesis of subgenomic RNAs. Our studies do provide data supporting the idea that the 3\u2032UTR likely is a single functional unit consisting of several interacting structures.We also noticed that the MHV 5\u2032UTR SL1 potentially forms base-pairing interactions with 3\u2032UTR S3; the 5\u2032UTR SL1 sequence 5\u2032 G 8 UGAUU 13 3\u2032 can be base paired to 3\u2032UTR S3 3\u2032C 1 ACUAA 6 5\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTR SL1 5\u2032G 14 GCGUCCGUAC 24 3\u2032 can be base paired to 3\u2032UTR S3 3\u2032 C 218 UGUAGGUA AG 228 5\u2032. We hypothesized that these interactions might be necessary for the genome circulization postulated by the Zuniga/Sola (Sola et al., 2005; Zuniga et al., 2004) model to promote the switch between transcription and replication. A series of mutations were designed to investigate these hypothesized interactions between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032UTRs and we attempted to recover infectious virus harboring these mutations. These studies failed to support these hypothesized interactions (data not shown). Additional structural and biophysical studies to determine in detail the interactions of the various structures in the entire 3\u2032 UTR and their dynamics are required to more fully understand their roles in viral replication."", ""Cells and viruses"": ""Murine 17Cl-1, DBT, and L2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone), 4 mM glutamine, and penicillin and streptomycin, each at 50 \u03bcg/ml. BHK-R cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented as described above but containing 800 \u03bcg/ml G418. MHV-A59 1000 (Yount et al., 2002) , was the virus used as our wild type strain. Wild type and mutant virus stocks were grown and tittered by plaque assay as described previously (Johnson et al., 2005) ."", ""Generation of recombinant viruses"": ""The reverse genetic system described by Yount et al. (Yount et al., 2002) was used to recover wild-type MHV-A59 (MHV-A59 1000) and mutant viruses. Mutant viruses containing the A and B mutations had previously been isolated by Johnson et al. (Johnson et al., 2005) . Mutations creating small sequence disruptions of S3 and S4 (C, D, CD, ABC, ABD, and ABCD) were generated in a G plasmid template by site-directed mutagenesis; mutations creating larger sequence disruptions in S3, S4, and L3 (E, F, G, H, EH, FG, LRD, SLT2, SLT6) were generated by overlapping PCR with G plasmid as template. The sequences of mutagenic oligonucleotides are available on request. All mutated target sites were sequence verified and subcloned back into the original G plasmid as a 285 nt NruI-PacI fragment to obviate the potential for undesired mutants being present outside the 3\u2032UTR after site directed mutagenesis. The presence of the desired mutation was again verified by sequencing and these plasmids were subsequently used to regenerate infectious virus. Bacteria containing the seven plasmids (A-G) making up the MHV-A59 reverse genetic system were propagated at 30 1C and plasmid DNA purified using a plasmid Midi prep kit from OMEGA BIO-TEK according to the manufacturer's protocol. The MHV cDNAs were excised from mutant and wild type G plasmids, gel purified, and ligated to MHV-A59 cDNAs A-G to generate cDNAs corresponding to the entire MHV genome under the control of a T7 promoter. Full length cDNAs were in vitro transcribed using the Ambion mMessage mMachine T7 kit. Transcripts corresponding to the N gene coding sequence were also transcribed in vitro as described by Yount et al. (Yount et al., 2002) . The N gene was mixed with the in vitro transcribed RNA and electroporated into BHK-R cells using a Biorad Gene Pulser. Electroporation was carried out three times at 0.85 kV. After electroporation, BHK-R cells were overlaid onto freshly seeded DBT cells in a T75 flask. Cultures were incubated for up to 3 days and monitored by phase microscopy for the development of cytopathic effect (CPE). Cultures that did not demonstrate CPE were blind passaged in DBT cells. A mutation was not considered to be lethal until at least 3 independent trials were performed, at least one of which was done at 34 1C and 39 1C to allow for recovery of temperature sensitive viruses. The cultures were frozen at \u221280 1C, sonicated, clarified by low speed centrifugation and virus plaque cloned on L2 cells. Individual plaques were then inoculated onto a confluent monolayer of DBT cells to generate small virus stocks. After maximal CPE developed the cell culture fluids were frozen at \u2212801 and RNA was extracted for later analysis."", ""Characterization of recombinant viruses"": ""RNA was extracted from infected monolayers of DBT cells using RNeasy RNA extraction kits (Qiagen). All recombinant viruses that were recovered had their 3\u2032 UTRs sequenced. RT-PCR sequencing was carried out as described below. Reverse transcription reactions were carried out using 1 mg of total RNA, 1 ml of primer 20TG and the RNAprimer mixture was heated to 65 1C for 5 min. After heating, the reaction was put on ice for \u223c1 min and then 1 \u03bcl 0.1 M DTT and 4 \u03bcl 5 \u00c2 First-Strand buffer was added along with 1 ml of Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen Cat. no. 18080-044). The reaction was incubated at 42 1C for 60 min. The RT reaction was then heat inactivated at 70 1C for 15 min. The generated cDNA was PCR amplified using primers A59(+)30948 and Eco20TG (Table 1 ). The conditions for the PCR reaction were as follows: 94 1C for 1 min followed by 30 cycles each consisting of 30 s at 94 1C, 1 min at 58 1C, and 1 min 68 1C. Amplified fragments were gel purified and sequenced with the primer A59(+)30948 (Table 1) .Viral plaque sizes were measured by projecting the individual well plates and an adjacent millimeter ruler with an overhead projector to achieve at least 10 \u00c2 magnification. Thirty plaques were measured for each virus in order to encompass the entire range of plaque phenotypes. Mean plaque sizes were calculated using the magnification factor determined from the millimeter ruler. Only clear plaques with a distinct circumference were measured.To determine one-step growth kinetics, DBT cells were grown in 96-well plates and replicate cultures infected with either WT or mutant viruses at a MOI of 3. Samples were frozen at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 h post infection.

Negative-sense genomic and subgenomic RNAs in the cellular RNA was assayed by nested RT-PCR as previously described (Johnson et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2007; Yount et al., 2002) . To detect negative-strand RNA complementary to the genome, oligo A59 (+) 14639-14658 (Table 1 ) was used as the RT primer for cDNA synthesis. Primers A59 (+)14639-14658 and A59 (\u2212)16596-16577 were used in the first PCR reaction and primers A59 (+)16038-16059 and A59 (\u2212)16596-16577 were used in the nested PCR reaction (Table 1) . A no RT control was always run for each sample to be certain that any signal detected did not arise from residual plasmid DNA. To detect negative-strand RNA complementary to subgenomic mRNA 6, primer A59(+)1-20 was used as the RT primer, primers A59(+)7-23 and A59(\u2212)29593-29613 were used in the first PCR reaction, and primers A59(+)26-47 and A59(\u2212)29327-29345 were used in a nested PCR reaction.

Mouse hepatitis virus genomes containing three or four nucleotide mutations that destabilize either S3 or S4 were viable, whereas genomes carrying these mutations in both S3 and S4 were not viable. A genome carrying these mutations in S3 and S4 plus compensatory mutations restoring base-pairing yielded a virus with wild type phenotype. Larger mutations which completely disrupt S3 or S4 generated various phenotypes. Mutations opening up S3 were lethal. Disruptions of S4 generated both viable and lethal mutants. Genomes carrying the original mutations in S3 or S4 plus compensatory mutations restoring base pairing were viable and had robust growth phenotypes.

The case was developed very fast (Anderson et al., 2020) , until January 7, 2020, the Chinese government said that pneumonia was a new type of coronavirus or covid-19 .Common signs and symptoms of covid-19 infection include symptoms of acute respiratory disorders such as fever, coughing and shortness of breath. The average incubation period is 5-6 days with the longest incubation period of 14 days. In severe cases, covid-19 can cause pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death. The clinical signs and symptoms reported in the majority of cases are fever, with some cases having difficulty breathing, and Xrays show extensive pneumonia infiltrates in both lungs (Holshue et al., 2020; Perlman, 2020) . The clinical symptoms of severe and critical patients with covid-19 are likely similar with the clinical symptoms of SARS and MERS (Wang et al., 2020b) .In Indonesia, on March 2, 2020, Indonesia has reported 2 confirmed cases of covid-19. As of March 29, 2020, it has increased to 1285 cases in 30 provinces. The five highest provinces in the covid-19 cases are Jakarta (675), West Java (149), Banten (106), East Java (90), and Central Java (63) (Kementerian Kesehatan Republik Indonesia, 2020). The increase in the number of cases took place quite quickly and there has been a spread between countries. In response to that, WHO set covid-19 as a pandemic (Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020) .The extreme weather conditions that accompany long-term climate change may also contribute to the spread of the West Nile virus in the United States and Europe (Epstein, 2001) . Certain climatic conditions can be considered as the top predictors of respiratory diseases such as SARS. Climate variables can also be a direct cause of biological interactions between SARS-CoV and humans. Optimal temperature, humidity, and wind speed are variables that can determine the survival and transmission of the SARS virus (Yuan et al., 2006) . Changes in weather are very significantly correlated with changes in mortality rates due to pneumonia (Bull, 1980) . Viruses can be transmitted by being influenced by several factors, including climatic conditions (such as temperature and humidity), and population density (Dalziel et al., 2018) . Research on climate change and covid-19 is still very limited so this research will contribute to efforts to prevent covid-19 disease."", ""Study area"": ""Jakarta is the Capital of the Republic of Indonesia.

The population of Jakarta in 2017 based on projections of results of the 2010 Population Census population was 10.374.235 (Mawarni, 2019) inhabitants with the population growth rate of 0.94% per year."", ""Data collection"": ""The computerized data set on daily covid-19 in Jakarta for the period of January -March 29, 2020 were obtained from the Ministry of Health of Republic of Indonesia, while the weather data for the period of February 2020 were obtained from the Meteorological Department of the Republic of Indonesia.

Fig. 1 shows that covid-19 that occurred in Jakarta experienced a rapid increase. The first finding numbered 177 cases, the next report found 40 cases, and on 29 March 2020 the total number of covid-19 cases numbered 678. With an average of 61 cases, the weather data showed temperature minimum of 24.6\u00b0C (with the highest temperature minimum of 27.5\u00b0C), the lowest maximum temperature of 28.6\u00b0C (with the highest maximum temperature of 31.4\u00b0C), the lowest average temperature of 26.1\u00b0C (with the highest average temperature of 28.6\u00b0C), the lowest humidity of 75% (with the highest humidity of 93%), and the lowest rainfall of 1.1 mm (with the highest of 88 mm). Table 1 shows that, among five weather variables, only temperature average (\u00b0C) was significantly correlated with covid-19 (r = 0.392; p b .001), with medium level. Temperature minimum, temperature maximum, humidity, and rainfall were not significantly correlated with covid-19."", ""Results and discussion"": ""In this study, the pattern of climate change provides a picture of the occurrence of covid-19 e in Jakarta. We found only temperature average was correlated with Covid-19, with the lowest average temperature of 26.1\u00b0C and the highest temperature of 28.6\u00b0C. This correlation is in line with previous research that shows the relationship between weather transmission and Syncytial Virus Respiration (RSV) (Vandini et al., 2013) , SARS (Tan et al., 2005) . Temperature is also the environmental driver of the covid-19 outbreak in China (Shi et al., 2020) . The regression equation shows how temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed affected SARS transmission (Yuan et al., 2006) .In spite of the weather, the high covid-19 cases in Jakarta is also caused by the very high mobility of the people. As the capital city of Indonesia, Jakarta is the main economic destination for job seekers who come from various regions in Indonesia. Jakarta's population density is also very high and this allows covid-19 transmission to be very fast.Another cause is that Jakarta is a very densely populated area. The majority of the population is residents from outside Jakarta, generally they choose the location of residence in the area because of the affordable price factor (Fitria and Setiawan, 2014) . According to the results of the last national census, Jakarta is inhabited by almost 9.6 million people, exceeding the projected population of 9.2 million for 2025. Jakarta's population is 4% of the country's total population, 237.6 million people (Widiarso, n.d.) . This means Jakarta's population has grown 4.4% over the past 10 years, up from 8.3 million in 2000 (Surjadi and Surja, 2019) . With population growth like this allows covid-19 to spread rapidly (Zu et al., 2020) .In China, Wang et al. (2020a) found that temperature and relative humidity have a strong influence on the R value, with a significant level of 1% for both. Temperature and humidity have a significant and consistent distribution of seasonal behavior of respiratory viruses (Sajadi et al., 2020) . Meteorological variables can predict worldwide outbreaks with high correlations (r 2 N 0.6) with real data (Chen et al., 2020) . In Wuhan, covid-19 transmission is very important to be associated with transmission, there is a correlation between weather and disease spread, and weather factors will suppress disease when the weather warms up (Guo et al., n.d.) .Meteorological factors such as humidity, visibility, and wind speed can affect environmental stability, or affect the viability of viruses. As well as air temperatures have an impact on the transmission of the epidemic. Besides, absolute air temperature and humidity have been indicated to significantly affect covid-19 transmission (Chen et al., 2020) . Temperature and humidity variations may be important factors that influence covid-19 mortality (Ma et al., 2020) . There is a correlation between the spread of covid-19 on temperature and climate latitude (Poole, 2020) .Despite the significant finding of the weather on covid-19, this study has limitations: First, as the disease is caused by the virus, many factors are needed to be investigated such as virus resistance, population mobility, and population endurance. Second, individual health factors such as hand washing habits, personal hygiene, and use of hand sanitizers may be the other related factors of covid-19 that are necessary to be explored.

The pattern of liver disease differs geographically, between various ethnic groups with different practices, and in time period [2] . The pattern of onset and prominence of symptoms can rapidly suggest a diagnosis, particularly if major risk factors are considered, such as the age and sex of the patient and a history of exposure or risk behaviours [3] .The aetiology of end-stage liver disease varies between different geographical areas of the globe. Hepatotropic viruses are the chief causes of end-stage liver disease in most regions of the world [4] . Alcohol is an important cause of end-stage liver disease in developed countries and in certain parts of India as well [5] . With the beginning of routine screening of blood and blood products of hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers and vaccination in the last few decades, the frequency of end-stage liver disease due to HBV has decreased in the developed world, making hepatitis C virus (HCV) the major cause there [6] .Earlier data on the aetiological spectrum of end-stage liver disease from Northern India revealed HBV and HCV infections as the predominant causes of chronic liver disease [7] . A recent prospective, multicentre study involving 20,701,383 patients from different parts of India showed that 1.28% (n = 266,621) of these patients had chronic liver disease, while 65,807 (24.68%) were diagnosed for the first time. A final analysis of 13,014 cases of chronic liver disease (19.77%) showed that 33.9% presented with decompensated cirrhosis. Alcoholism (34.3% of 4,413) was the most common cause of cirrhosis, while hepatitis B (33.3%) was the predominant cause of chronic liver disease in general as well as of non-cirrhotic chronic liver disease (40.8% out of 8,163). The predominant cause of chronic liver disease was hepatitis C in the north, alcohol in the northeast, hepatitis B in the east and the south, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the west and differed significantly in various regions [8] . NAFLD is also highly prevalent in the western population [9] .Many prognostic scores have been used for predicting prognosis in patients with end-stage liver disease and for determining the most appropriate treatment. After about four decades, the Child score [10] was replaced by the modified Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score [11] as a reference for assessing the prognosis of cirrhosis. Of the other prognostic scores, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is more reproducible than the CTP score, as it does not use subjective variables like encephalopathy and ascites [12] . As such, the MELD score has replaced the CTP score for deciding on the priority of allocation of a liver donor [13] .In a large systematic review, the CTP and MELD scores had comparable prognostic values in most of the cases, but their benefits varied in some specific conditions [14] . Therefore, whether the CTP score should definitely be abandoned for use of the MELD score remains uncertain.Cirrhotic patients often develop dilutional hyponatraemia due to altered vascular haemodynamics. Activa-tion of these mechanisms correlates with the degree of portal hypertension [15] . Hyponatraemia with lower sodium values predicts worse outcomes and is an independent predictor of survival at 3 and 12 months [16] . A modified score including serum sodium -termed the \""MELD sodium\"" score (MELD-Na) -was proposed as an alternative to the MELD score [17] and was implemented for liver transplant allocation in 2016, since hyponatraemia is a strong predictor of mortality among liver transplant waitlist patients [18] .No data are available regarding the prognostic utility of these scores in predicting short-term outcomes among patients with end-stage liver disease in India. As such, this study was conducted to assess disease severity in patients with end-stage liver disease using the CTP score, the MELD score and the MELD-Na score and to compare these prognostic scores as predictors of 3-month mortality among patients with end-stage liver disease."", ""Subjects and Methods"": ""This observational longitudinal follow-up study was carried out at the Himalayan Institute Hospital, a tertiary healthcare centre in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India. One hundred and seventyone patients admitted consecutively with a primary admission diagnosis of end-stage liver disease were included in the study.The diagnosis of end-stage liver disease was based on historytaking; clinical examination including jaundice, ascites, upper gastrointestinal bleed, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and hyperbilirubinaemia accompanied by a modest increase in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase; ultrasound findings; and other appropriate assessments, wherever required. Patients with ascites due to tuberculosis or malignancy, as well as those with malignancies other than hepatocellular carcinoma, were excluded from the study. Survival at 3 months following the index admission was determined by either telephonic follow-up or patient attendance at the medical outpatient department, if discharged from the hospital. CTP, MELD and MELD-Na scores were calculated on the basis of laboratory values obtained within 24 h of admission. Patient outcome was assessed after 3 months as \""survivor\"" or \""non-survivor.\"" The CTP score included two continuous variables (bilirubin and albumin) and three discrete variables (ascites, encephalopathy and international normalized ratio [INR] ). This score was divided into three classes: class A (5-6), class B (7-9) and class C (10-15). The formulas used for the calculations were as follows: MELD score = 3.78 \u00d7 ln(serum bilirubin [mg/dL]) + 11.2 \u00d7 ln(INR) + 9.57 \u00d7 ln(serum creatinine [mg/ dL]) + 6.43; MELD-Na score = MELD score + 1.59 (135 -Na) with maximum and minimum Na values of 135 and 120 mmol/L, respectively [19, 20] .All the scores were recorded periodically from indoor patients. The predictive values of the CTP, MELD and MELD-Na scores regarding 3-month mortality were assessed and compared. Inflamm Intest Dis 2020;5:1-10 DOI: 10.1159/000503921"", ""Statistical Analysis"": ""The data thus collected were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS 22. A one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used for checking the assumption of normality of the data. Continuous variables are expressed as median (range), and they were compared with the Mann-Whitney U test, as some of the variables did not have a normal distribution. The \u03c7 2 test or Fisher's exact test was used for comparing the qualitative variables. The prognostic utility of the CTP, MELD and MELD-Na scores in assessing mortality at 3 months was calculated by determining the concordance (C-) statistic (equivalent to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]). Comparison of the C-statistics of various prognostic scores was done by DeLong's test. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression was performed for determining the potential independent predictors of 3-month mortality among end-stage liver disease patients. Only the clinical parameters assessed in all patients were used for the multivariate analysis. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. All reported p values are two-sided. Values are presented as n (%). Socio-economic status was defined as \""high\"" (annual income INR >850,000), \""middle\"" (annual income INR 50,000-850,000) and \""low\"" (annual income INR <50,000) (INR 1 = USD 0.015). Residence was defined as \""urban\"" for all places with a municipality, corporation, cantonment board or notified town area committee and all other places that satisfied the criteria of a minimum population of 5,000, at least 75% of the male main workers engaged in non-agricultural pursuits and a density of population of at least 400/km 2 . All areas that were not categorized as \""urban\"" were considered \""rural.\"" Bold type denotes significance. IMFL, India-made foreign liquor; NASH, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. "", ""Results"": ""The demographic characteristics of the 171 patients with end-stage liver disease are shown in Table 1 . Out of the total of 171 patients, 24 (14.03%) expired, while 147 (85.96%) survived. The patients' age range was 20-80 years and their mean age (\u00b1SD) was 48.94 \u00b1 12.63 years (median age 50 years; range 60). There was no significant difference in median age between survivors and non-survivors (median age 48 years, range 60, and median age 54.5 years, range 49, respectively; p = 0.118).Among the 171 patients, end-stage liver disease was caused by alcohol in 88 patients (51.46%) and by both alcohol and a virus in 11 patients (6.43%). A pure viral aetiology was present in 51 patients (29.82%), i.e., hepatitis B in 36 cases (21.05%), hepatitis C in 11 cases (6.43%), hepatitis B + C in 3 cases (1.75%) and hepatitis B + A in 1 case (0.58%). End-stage liver disease was due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in 13 patients (7.60%), autoimmune hepatitis in 7 patients (4.09%) and Wilson's disease in 1 patient (0.58%). Of the 99 patients with alcoholic end-stage liver disease, 92 patients abstained from alcohol, while 7 patients started taking alcohol after their discharge from the hospital, though on an irregular basis. At the end of 3 months, mortality was recorded at 17.39% (16/92) among the patients who abstained from alcohol and at 28.57% (2/7) among those who persisted with the habit of taking alcohol.There were various symptoms seen in the patients with end-stage liver disease: jaundice (69.00%), ascites (63.15%), hepatic encephalopathy (32.74%), melaena (29.82%) and haematemesis (20.46%). The most common signs seen among the patients with end-stage liver disease were icterus (69.00%), pallor (28.07%), splenomegaly (25.14%) and parotid enlargement (23.39%).Ascites, jaundice, haematemesis, hepatic encephalopathy, decreased urinary output, peripheral oedema, parotid enlargement, white nails, and loss of axillary and pubic hair occurred significantly more often among nonsurvivors than among survivors (p < 0.05 each), as shown in Table 2 . White blood cell count (p = 0.001), serum bilirubin (p = 0.004), INR (p < 0.001) and serum creatinine Values are presented as n (%). All patients were examined for clinical features such as white nails, parotid enlargement, and loss of axillary and pubic hair as per working proforma. Parotid enlargement was assessed by inspection and palpation. In borderline cases, it was confirmed by ultrasound examination of the parotid glands. Bold type denotes significance.Prognostic Scores in End-Stage Liver Disease (p < 0.001) were significantly higher, while serum albumin (p < 0.001) and serum sodium (p = 0.006) were lower among non-survivors than among survivors (Table 3) . For 3-month mortality, the C-statistic for the CTP score was 0.93 (p < 0.0001, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-0.96) and was statistically significant (Fig. 1a) . Using an optimal CTP cut-off > 11, the sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of 3-month mortality were 76. 19 and 100%, respectively. The C-statistic for the predictive value of the MELD score for 3-month mortality was 0.86 (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 0.79-0.90) and was statistically significant (Fig. 1b) . Using an optimal MELD cut-off > 26, the sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of 3-month mortality were 81.63 and 75%, respectively, while for a cut-off of 18, the sensitivity was 37.41% and the specificity 100%. For 3-month mortality, the C-statistic for the MELD-Na score was 0.83 (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 0.77-0.89) and was statistically significant (Fig. 1c) . Using an optimal MELD-Na cut-off > 32.14, the sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of 3-month mortality were 77.40 and 83.33%, respectively.The difference between the C-statistic of the CTP score and that of the MELD score was statistically significant for 3-month mortality (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 0.65-0.79); the CTP score was superior to the MELD score in predicting 3-month mortality (Fig. 2a) . The difference between the C-statistic of the CTP score and that of the MELD-Na score was statistically significant for 3-month mortality (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 0.64-0.78); the CTP score was superior to the MELD-Na score in predicting 3-month mortality (Fig. 2b) . The difference between the C-statistic of the MELD score and that of the MELD-Na score was statistically significant for 3-month mortality (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 0.79-0.88); the MELD score was superior to the MELD-Na score in predicting 3-month mortality (Fig. 2c) .Of the various clinical and laboratory variables showing significant differences between end-stage liver disease survivors and non-survivors, INR, serum bilirubin, decreased urinary output and white nails were found to be independent predictors of 3-month mortality among end-stage liver disease patients using multivariate analysis by logistic regression. Loss of axillary and pubic hair, showing a significant difference between end-stage liver disease survivors and non-survivors, was not entered as a variable into the logistic regression model for examining independent predictors of 3-month mortality, since the number of observations was inadequate for logistic regression analysis (Table 4 )."", ""Discussion"": ""End-stage liver disease leads to a rise in morbidity and mortality, with the majority of preventable cases attributed to excessive alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis or NAFLD. Single or multifactorial insults to the liver result in cirrhosis, the most common factors being alcohol abuse, chronic hepatitis C and obesity with concomitant NAFLD [21] .In a study conducted by Shrestha et al. [22] at a tertiary care centre in Nepal, 130 patients with diagnosed liver disease were analysed; most of the patients were in the range of 41-50 years of age, followed by those at 31-40 years of age. Our findings are in agreement with the findings of that study, since most of the patients were above 40 years of age (range 20-80 years). This shows that liver diseases are more common after the fourth decade of life in our region. A study conducted in India by Trimukhe and Rai [23] showed chronic alcoholism (36.8%), chronic hepatitis B (36.8%) and chronic hepatitis C (3.2%) as the main aetiologies of chronic liver disease. Differences may be observed regarding the age, aetiology and clinical presentation of patients in Northern India and the USA/Europe. The mean age of our patients was 48.94 years and a male predominance was seen (male:female ratio 5.1). Most of the cases of cirrhosis were due to alcohol, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and NAFLD, while in a study in Italy, the mean age of the patients with cirrhosis was 60.3 years, with a male:female ratio of 1.7. The most common cause of cirrhosis was HCV infection, alone or in combination with other aetiologic agents (58.6%), HBV (7.6%) and alcohol abuse (16.0%) [24] .Another study in France reported alcohol (88%), viral hepatitis (5%), alcohol plus viral hepatitis (4%) and others (3%) as aetiologies of cirrhosis [25] . In the USA, diabetes, alcohol abuse, hepatitis C and B, male sex and older age were all independently associated with cirrhosis, with a population attributable fraction of 53.5% from viral hepatitis (mostly hepatitis C), diabetes, and alcohol abuse [26] . There has also been a recent increase in the prevalence of cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in the USA [27] .A large number of cirrhosis patients have no symptoms in early stages. Clinical symptoms at presentation may include jaundice of the eyes or skin, pruritus, gastrointestinal bleeding, coagulopathy, increasing abdominal girth and mental status changes [28] . In a study on 180 patients with end-stage liver disease in the central part of India, the most common presentation was ascites (76.1%), followed by splenomegaly (52.2%), jaundice (50%), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (32.2%), hepatic encephalopathy (22.2%), thrombocytopenia (16.6%) and hepatorenal syndrome (15%) [23] . However, in our study, the most common presentation was jaundice (69.00%), followed by ascites (63.15%), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (39.18%), hepatic encephalopathy (32.74%), anaemia (28.07%) and splenomegaly (25.14%).Different predictive models are used to assess prognosis in cirrhotic patients. There are few studies which have assessed the ability of CTP, MELD and MELD-Na scores to predict mortality. In our study, we recruited 171 pa- tients with end-stage liver disease and calculated their CTP, MELD and MELD-Na scores. For 3-month mortality, the C-statistics for the CTP, MELD and MELD-Na scores were statistically significant. Using an optimal CTP cut-off > 11, the sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of 3-month mortality were 76.19 and 100%, respectively. Using an optimal MELD cut-off > 26, the sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of 3-month mortality were 81.63 and 75%, respectively, while for a cut-off of 18, the sensitivity was 37.41% and the specificity 100%. Using an optimal MELD-Na cut-off > 32.14, the sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of 3-month mortality were 77.40 and 83.33%, respectively. As such, all three prognostic scores were of value in assessing the prognosis of patients with end-stage liver disease.We used AUCs to compare the accuracy of the CTP, MELD and MELD-Na scores. In a meta-analysis of 269 studies comparing the discriminative ability of the CTP score with that of the MELD score to assess the prognosis of cirrhotic patients, 44 studies favoured the MELD score, 16 favoured the CTP score, 99 found both to be of similar value, and 110 did not report any statistically significant difference [14] . Previous studies in France [25] and the USA [29] have shown that the MELD score performs better than the CTP score in predicting 3-month mortality among patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation. In a meta-analysis of 26 studies involving 4,732 patients having acute-on-chronic liver failure, the MELD score was found to have the largest AUC (0.82) when compared with other scoring systems estimated, especially for 3-month mortality [30] . Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that the MELD-Na score (0.82) or the MELD score (0.81) at admission predicted in-hospital mortality better than did the CTP score (0.76) [25] . A prospective study by Wiesner et al. [29] on 3,437 patients on a liver transplantation waiting list showed that the MELD score was significantly superior to the CTP score in predicting 3-month mortality (AUC 0.83 vs. 0.76). Interestingly, another study analysing waiting list mortality in this regard showed a similar predictive value of the MELD and CTP scores for waiting list mortality [31] . However, in our study, the AUC was 0.93 for the CTP score, 0.86 for the MELD score and 0.83 for the MELD-Na score, and the CTP score was superior to the MELD score in predicting 3-month mortality (p < 0.0001). In the study by Wiesner et al. [29] , the study cohort was different to the cohort of our study, as their patients were on a transplant waiting list. Similarly, Londo\u00f1o et al. [17] found serum sodium and the MELD score as independent predictors of survival for patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation, but hepatitis C (44%) was the commonest aetiology of cirrhosis among their patients, followed by alcohol (26%), both alcohol and hepatitis C (8%), hepatitis B (7%) and other aetiologies (15%), while alcohol was the most common cause of cirrhosis among our patients.Our results are supported by some other studies which failed to confirm the superiority of the MELD to the CTP score [32] [33] [34] . A study by Heuman and Mihas [33] on 6,958 patients showed that the CTP score slightly outperformed the MELD score in predicting 3-month mortality (AUC 0.76 vs. 0.75), and the authors suggested that the superiority of the MELD score observed by Wiesner et al. [29] was probably the result of selection bias. In a study involving 257 patients with cirrhosis at the liver transplantation centre of Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran, Iran, the statistical analysis of the prediction of mortality or removal from the waiting list due to severe deterioration showed an AUC of 0.75 for the CTP score and 0.69 for the MELD score [34] . The better performance of the CTP score compared to those of the MELD/MELD-Na scores in our study appears to have its basis in the different aetiologies and clinical presentations, which can vary depending on the country and region of the world. As the different prognostic scores have varying components, a particular prognostic score may perform better for a particular clinical presentation. In our study, 63.15% (108/171) of the patients had ascites and 32.74% (56/171) had hepatic encephalopathy, while in a study by Dupont et al. [25] in France, ascites was observed only in 4.98% (14/281) of the patients and hepatic encephalopathy in 9.96% (28/281) of the patients. They found the MELD and MELD-Na scores to be better than the CTP score in predicting in-hospital mortality among cirrhotic patients. Although in our study as well as in their study, the mean serum sodium level was significantly lower among nonsurvivors than among survivors, the higher number of patients with ascites and hepatic encephalopathy in our study might have contributed to the better performance of the CTP score compared to the MELD/MELD-Na scores in predicting 3-month mortality among the cirrhotic patients in our series. It therefore appears logical that a particular scoring method may be preferred over others in the assessment of chronic liver disease based on different clinical settings, aetiologies, or regions of the world.The differences noted between the scores matter in clinical practice, since depending upon the clinical presentation, a particular score may be more useful than another. For a patient with hepatic encephalopathy and as-Inflamm Intest Dis 2020;5:1-10 DOI: 10.1159/000503921 cites, the CTP score may be more valid, as it incorporates these components, while for a patient having renal impairment with/without hyponatraemia, the MELD/ MELD-Na scores may be more valid.Hyponatraemia has also been shown to be a factor associated with liver-related mortality independent of the MELD score [35] . Previous attempts to incorporate serum sodium into the MELD score resulted in a better accuracy in predicting mortality than with the MELD score alone [36] . The median MELD score in the non-survivor group in our study was 32.5 (range 29) and the median MELD-Na score was 42.67 (range 44.82), while the median MELD and MELD-Na scores in the survivor group were 20 (range 32) and 23.13 (range 53.83), respectively. Serum sodium was also low in the non-survivors as compared to the survivors, with median values of 130.15 (range 29) and 133.6 (range 23.28) mmol/L, respectively.In a study conducted by Biggins et al. [20] , among 753 Americans with cirrhosis mainly due to chronic hepatitis C and alcoholic liver disease, those with MELD-Na scores of 20, 30 and 40 had 6-month mortality rates of 6, 16 and 37%, respectively. In contrast, in our study, the mortality rates among patients with MELD-Na scores of < 20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50 and > 50 were 4.16 (n = 1), 12.50 (n = 3), 25 .00 (n = 6), 33.33% (n = 8) and 25.00% (n = 6), respectively. However, in our study, both the CTP and the MELD score outperformed the MELD-Na score in predicting 3-month mortality (p < 0.0001 each). Thus, our study shows that the CTP score outperforms the MELD and MELD-Na scores in predicting 3-month mortality."", ""Conclusions"": ""The CTP, MELD and MELD-Na scores were very good predictors of 3-month mortality among end-stage liver disease patients in a study cohort from Northern India. However, the CTP score was superior to the MELD and MELD-Na scores in predicting 3-month mortality. The performance of any particular scoring method for end-stage liver disease may depend on the variable clinical settings and aetiologies of liver disease occurring in the different regions of the world.""}","Child-Turcotte-Pugh Score, MELD Score and MELD-Na Score as Predictors of Short-Term Mortality among Patients with End-Stage Liver Disease in Northern India","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and MELD-sodium (MELD-Na) scores are used for predicting disease severity and mortality among patients with end-stage liver disease. However, data regarding their usefulness in predicting the short-term outcome of end-stage liver disease are not available in India. This prospective study compared the CTP score, MELD score and MELD-Na score as predictors of short-term outcome among patients with end-stage liver disease.

The aetiology of end-stage liver disease and the clinical presentation were determined. RESULTS: The CTP score, MELD score and MELD-Na score on day 1 were significantly higher among non-survivors than among survivors (p < 0.0001 each). The C-statistic for 3-month mortality for the CTP score was 0.93 (p < 0.0001), that for the MELD score was 0.86 (p < 0.0001) and that for the MELD-Na score was 0.83 (p < 0.0001).

On each occasion, the city must react differently but with some primary and overlapping factors that need to be understood both broadly and in detail. This is also similar to earlier statement of the Rockefeller Foundation 100 Resilient Cities organization, who argue that \""\u2026building urban resilience requires looking at a city holistically: understanding the systems that make up the city and the interdependencies and risks they may face\"" (100 Resilient Cities 2018) . In their report, 100 Resilient Cities (ibid) also highlight some of the main drivers of urban resilience that address the factors of infrastructure and environment precisely at the city level. These factors include:"", ""\u2022 Provide and Enhances Protective Natural and Man-Made Assets"": ""Maintain protective natural and man-made assets that reduce the physical vulnerability of city systems. This includes natural systems like wetlands, mangroves, and sand dunes or built environment like sea walls and levees."", ""\u2022 Ensure Continuity of Critical Services"": ""Actively manage and enhance natural and man-made resources. This includes designing physical infrastructure such as roads and bridges to withstand floods so that people can evacuate, as well as ecosystem management for floor risk management. It also includes emergency response plans and contingency plans that may coordinate airports to function so that relief can be lifted in and out during a crisis."", ""\u2022 Provide Reliable Communication and Mobility"": ""Provide a free flow of people, information, and goods. This includes information and communication networks as well as physical movement through a multimodal transport system.In their opening statement of their study, Cornaro (2018b, p. 2467) , highlight the importance of resilience for multiple reasons:The need for future cities to be resilient stems from the fact that now more than ever in history, both natural and human-made hazards are threatening cities in the forms of shocks and stresses. The ability of cities to resist or restore themselves following these events is dependent on their resilience. This statement reflects on the importance of resilience (Hopkins 2009 ) in cities and city management, particularly for those that face hazards, threats, emergencies, and shocks. This requires integrated thinking (Coaffee 2013; Cheshmehzangi 2016) and a comprehensive approach (Cheshmehzangi 2020) of urban resilience in planning practice. The restoration of cities through resilience is detectable in many cases, with methods of integrating the operations, prioritising key systems, and development of a chance for the development of multi-sectoral management to inter-sectoral management. In this regard, what we see is a unique opportunity to create a healthy network between multiple domains (Ban 2012; Linkov et al. 2013; Hajer and Dassen 2014; Cornaro 2018a, b, 2019) , through which we can reduce the adverse impacts on the social domain (in particular). Hence, the opportunity can create a new mechanism to not only maintain the primary city dynamism but also to enhance them when and where needed.In the literature, urban resilience is also regarded as an important concept for 'sustainability' and 'sustainable development' ( Deng and Cheshmehzangi 2018; 'Urban Resilience' webpage 2020) , and particularly the environmental sustainability (van der Heijden 2014; Schewenius et al. 2014; Sanchez et al. 2018 ; ICLEI webpage 2020) and emerging as a component of sustainability in urban policy (Davidson et al. 2019) , or associated to issues of climate change, climate change impacts, and climate change disasters (IPCC 2007; ISET et al. 2010; Roberts 2010; Moench and Tyler 2011; Cheshmehzangi and Dawodu 2018; Kershaw 2018) . It is regarded as a holistic approach that recognises the systems and processes of urban metabolism (Marvin and Medd 2006; Hajer and Dassen 2014; Admiraal and Cornaro 2018a, b) and the urban being (Renner 2018) ; or the backbone of city capabilities and measures for the time of need. While there are many conceptualisations and policies of urban resilience (Alexander 2013; Vogel and Henstra 2015; Sanchez et al. 2018; Huck and Monstadt 2019; Nunes et al. 2019) , this important topic is yet to be studied as a supplementary factor during the disruptions and adversities of outbreak events. Hence, this book partially addresses this major research gap and expands on the existing literature, which is discussed by cross-referencing to this important field of research in urban studies.Further to what urban resilience means in the various literature, Sanchez et al. (2018, pp. 3-7) also introduce a variety of resilience conceptualisations, of which the followings are addressed in detail, which are briefly mentioned here (for more details, refer to Sanchez et al. 2018 ):\u2022 'Disaster Resilience' (also see: Manyena 2006 , Coaffee and Bosher 2008 , Leichenko 2011 , Bosher 2014 ); \u2022 'Engineering Resilience' (also see: Klein et al. 2003 , Ahern 2011 , Manyena et al. 2011 , Davoudi et al. 2012 ); \u2022 'Ecological Resilience' (also see: Adger 2000 , Monstadt 2009 , Davoudi et al. 2012 , Anderies 2014 , Vale 2014 ); \u2022 'Socio-ecological Resilience' (also see: Alexander 2013 , Smith and Stirling 2010 , Hassler and Kohler 2014 , Meerow and Newell 2016 ; \u2022 'Evolutionary Resilience' (also see: Manyena et al. 2011 , Davoudi, et al. 2012 , Abdulkareem and Elkadi 2018 , Nunes et al. 2019 ); \u2022 'Built-in Resilience' (also see: Bosher et al. 2007 , Bosher 2008 , Bosher and Dainty 2011 , Bosher 2014 ; and \u2022 'Climate Change Resilience' (also see: Adger et al. 2011 , Leichenko 2011 Development Bank (ADB) 2014, Davoudi 2014) .In another example of demonstrating a multidisciplinary perspective of urban resilience, Chelleri and Olazabal (2012) put together a range of resilience conceptions, and put urban resilience as the core of all those necessities. They utilise some of the already mentioned examples of resilience, and few more, such as 'Socio-Technical Systems (STSs) Resilience', 'Individual (Psychological) Resilience', and 'Market (Economies) Resilience'. They (ibid) also refer to built-in resilience as 'Infrastructures' or 'Networks' resilience. They suggest engineering resilience as 'materials' resilience and define socio-ecological resilience as an intersection between two separated and defined resilience categories of 'Ecological' or 'Ecosystems' resilience (Alberti and Marzluff 2004; Minucci 2012; Monteiro et al. 2012) , and 'Social' resilience (Waters 2012) . The below diagram summaries their understanding of the multidisciplinary perspectives of urban resilience in relation to other resilience sectors (also see Chelleri and Olazabal 2012; Olazabal et al. 2012) . To summarise, their analysis (ibid) includes four primary resilience of social, markets (economies), infrastructures (networks) and ecological (ecosystems) in addition to their evident intersects comprised of: individual (psychological), STSs, Socio-Ecological Systems (SESs), and engineering (materials). In their analysis, Chelleri and Olazabal (2012) evaluate resilience in multiple disciplines and then position urban resilience in the center of all those defined primary and secondary resilience studies/thinking.There are also other less-defined categories that are highlighted by Sanchez et al. (2018, p. 7) . For instance, examples of stable and unstable resilience (Angeon and Bates 2015) , anticipatory and reactive resilience (Vale 2014) , or what Anderies et al. (2013) consider as the 'general resilience', which \""refers to broader system-level attributes such the ability to build and increase the capacity for learning and adaptation\"" (ibid, p. 4 ). There are also other more recent examples of \""societal resilience\"" (Marana et al. 2019) , which is suggested as a standardisation approach to support the resilience development process. In this chapter, our focus is more towards those generalities or \""general resilience\"" (elaborated from Anderies et al. 2013) , with some overlaps with disaster resilience, and defining what they may mean for the city management considerations in the case of disruptive disease outbreak events.Currently, as demonstrated in the review analysis by Sanchez et al. (2018) , urban resilience has gained popularity in various urban-related studies, stretching from climate change studies to urban studies and urban geography (Manyena 2006; Ernstson et al. 2010; Haase et al. 2014; Boyd, et al. 2015; Meerow and Newell 2016) , and often in the apparent combination with the overarching topics related to sustainability (Cheshmehzangi and Dawodu 2018) . These sustainability-oriented studies also address issues of diversity and sustainability of social-ecological systems (Folke et al. 2002) , (urban) sustainability governance (Sanchez et al. 2018) , recovery measures (UN Habitat 2012) , and associated to urban sustainability goals (Fiksel 2003; Register 2014) as well as the institutional understanding of the United Nation's sustainable development goals (SDGs) (Cheshmehzangi and Dawodu 2018; Acuti et al. 2020) . In more recent years, urban resilience has gained a stronger position in policy associated studies to urban governance systems (Sanchez et al. 2018; Davidson et al. 2019) , the complexity of city operations (Asian Development Bank (ADB) 2014; Tainter and Taylor 2014), climate resilience policies and governance (Davoudi 2014; Moffatt 2014; Lister 2016) , etc.As Davoudi (2014) puts it well, the topic of urban resilience emerging as the overarching field of 'resilient urbanism', which in fact is a response to a multiplicity of threats, risks/hazards, emergencies, disasters, etc. Many collections of scholarly work, cover the emerging crossovers from urbanism to urban development (Eraydin and Ta\u015fan-Kok 2013; Singh 2015; Crowe et al. 2016) or vice versa. It is also transferred from urban development to the fields of urban design (Pickett et al. 2013; Liao et al. 2016 ; Abdulkareen and Elkadi Abdulkareem and Elkadi 2018) and urban form (Sharifi 2019) , and is integrated into the ecological, socio-economics, and planning realms (Pickett et al. 2004; Smith and Stirling 2010; . These topics are emerging fast, addressing a range of challenges, risks, and resilience (Singh 2015) , such as risks associated with urban health (Singh et al. 2020) , urban planning measures (Yamagata and Sharifi 2018) . These are addressed from multiple perspectives of adaptation governance (Brunetta et al. 2019) , security (Fekete and Fiedrich 2018), urban transformations (Westley et al. 2011; Kabisch et al. 2018) , etc. Moreover, as it is highlighted by Sanchez et al. (2018, p. 10) , the emergence of 'urban resilience policy' is also developing fast and is explored from multiple aspects:Urban resilience policy is a complex and evolving field characterised by significant challenges associated with urban governance systems, political pressures, uncertain and emergent nature of threats, speed of change and the level of complexity of long-lived networks that form cities. Added to these issues, there are a number of resilience concepts that can potentially be used to develop such policies. These various conceptualisations come with a range of critiques, the most dominant being that they have a too strong focus on, for lack of a better term, bouncing back and seeking to maintain a known way of living; that they do not align well with other urban policy goals; and that their focus is too short-term and too small-scale.In this regard, we can verify the significance of resilience from multiple perspectives, a range of applicability, as well as from multiple approaches, multiple planning measures, and in various spatial scales (the UN-Habitat 2012; Asian Development Bank (ADB) 2014; Moffatt 2014; Resilience Alliance 2017; Sanchez et al. 2018 ). In addition, urban resilience surely is a very important concept for the city management scenarios of the outbreak events. It indeed responds to the crucial issues around the reduction of vulnerabilities and the enhancement of city stability. In the following sub-sections, we briefly explore the concept of resilience from three perspectives of education, its characteristics, and its comprehensiveness. It is believed these three factors are crucial to the early preparedness of the city in the case of disease outbreak events."", ""The Education of Resilience"": ""Our approach here must be recognised and valued as an educational approach, the one that can have a positive impact on how decision making can happen, how cities can improve their resilience, and how the society can be supported in a more extensive way. The education of resilience is as important as city operations and management. Hence, we first look into what covers the education of resilience, not only at the city level but also from the broader understanding of other scales that may be relevant to the city-scale studies of resilience. More recent scholarly research already cover the important topics of integrated health education in disaster risk reduction, including information dissemination (Pascapurnama et al. 2018) , public health education (Levy et al. 2017) , sector-based knowledge on public health emergencies (Ung 2020) , community engagement and public health ethics (Schoch-Sapana et al. 2020) , and public health decision making (Ambat et al. 2019) . Most studies explore these important factors from various perspectives of different scales, as their applications are very different between multiple scales. Some examples include decision making and control measures at the ward scale (Han et al. 2020) , outbreaks trends in specific settings or sectors (Taoti et al. 2019; Wu et al. 2019 ), neighbourhood level (Reyes-Castro et al. 2017 ), city-level (Levin-Rector et al. 2015 , provincial level (Chirambo et al. 2019) , and also at the state-level through national guidelines (Grafe et al. 2018) ; or from other perspectives of spatio-temporal dynamics (Paripa et al. 2019) and characteristics (Reyes-Castro et al. 2017) , control measures (Al-Abri et al. 2020), etc. Moreover, it is noticeable that these examples are all driven from specific outbreak experiences, and highlight some very valuable reflections of those adversities at the time of vulnerability and need. These are studied regardless of the magnitude of the impacts.From the extent of available literature, Gomes Ribeiro and Gon\u00e7alves (2019) argue in regards to what seems to be the minimal available tools or methods for the improvement of city resilience, and particularly the resilience of urban systems (also, The World Bank 2012). Their analysis covers four basic pillars of (1) resisting, (2) recovering, (3) adapting, and (4) transforming, while addressing how urban resilience should be seen from five dimensions of: 'natural/environmental, 'economic', 'social', 'physical/infrastructure', and 'institutional' (Tabibian and Movahed 2016; Gomes Riberio and Gon\u00e7alves 2019) ; two more dimensions than the three traditional sustainability pillars (i.e. Environmental, Social and Economic) and more complex in terms of their positions in the education and the practice of urban resilience. Also, there are some overlaps with some of those defined domains suggested by Linkov et al. (2013, p. 10109) in their proposed 'Resilience Matrix', as discussed in Chap. 2 of this book. The example of five dimensions by Tabibian and Movahed (2016) is a comprehensive illustration of not only multiple dimensions but also multiple factors of those dimensions. The breakdown of their resilient city framework includes the following factors under the specified five dimensions (ibid):"", ""Social Dimension"": ""Including multiple factors, such as 'Demographics (age, race, class, gender, occupation)', 'Social networks', 'Community values-cohesion', 'Income level', 'Faith-based organisations', 'Cultural diversity', 'Education', and 'Awareness Level'."", ""Economic Dimension"": ""Including multiple factors, such as 'Employment', 'Value of property', 'Financial stability and flexibility', 'Wealth generation', 'Municipal finance and revenues', 'Job diversity of residents', and 'Housing capital'."", ""Natural (or Environmental) Dimension"": ""Including multiple factors, such as 'Erosion rates', 'Biodiversity', 'Restoration of hydrologic flows', 'Conservation of ecologically vulnerable areas', 'Proximity of different habitats', and 'Wetlands acreage and loss'."", ""Physical (or Infrastructure) Dimension"": ""Including multiple factors, such as 'Transportation networks', 'Lifelines and critical infrastructure', 'Commercial and Manufacturing establishments', 'Water demand and conservation systems', 'Flexibility of grid', and 'Energy Monitoring'."", ""Institutional Dimension"": ""Including multiple factors, such as 'Hazard analysis and creation of hazard maps', 'Emergency services', 'Zoning and building standards', 'Emergency response plan', 'Interoperable communications', 'Continuity of operations plans', and 'Collaborative planning'.In addition to what we see from all above five dimensions of urban resilience and their breakdown (Tabibian and Movahed 2016) , there are added factors of resilient measures that need to be included in the case of emergencies, of particular outbreak events. These will be discussed in later parts of this chapter. Similarly, Huck and Monstadt (2019) suggest a critical reflection on the important topic of resilience, perhaps to be seen as a 'boundary concept', which indeed needs to be assessed and understood from a cross-boundary learning approach. In this regard, with such cross-boundary, multi-dimensional and multi-domain systematic structure, we verify the importance of resilience knowledge to a wide range of stakeholder constellations, including the governmental authorities, multiple city systems, developers, businesses, public and private sectors, and the general public. How we can reach each of these stakeholder groups is a practical challenge that may require further understanding of urban resilience practices.The transmission of resilience knowledge to each group is possible through various means and measures, which may not be so relevant to the overall aims of this book. Nevertheless, we can argue that it is within the boundaries of resilience knowledge that we can educate those individual or clustered groups, and for each of them in a different way. Regardless of how difficult it may be in real practice, such education is essential, particularly in the event of an outbreak and its progression at the city level. It is also important to note that such challenges of education may also be context-specific as they respond to specific issues that may be related to a particular city and irrelevant to others. These include urban structures, governance structures, the existing institutions of the specific location, etc. Hence, we refrain from solving context-specific challenges by suggesting ubiquitous solutions. In this chapter, we mainly provide a framework that is adaptive and comprehensive enough for not a location, but during a particular emergency event; meaning that it responds to what urban resilience and city management may need to address during the disease outbreak event."", ""The Characteristics of Resilience"": ""Broadly speaking, there are certain characteristics attached to the concept of resilience. Consequently, for urban resilience, as Gomes Ribeiro and Gon\u00e7alves (2019) demonstrate, there are also five relevant urban resilience characteristics, including, (1) Redundancy, (2) Robustness, (3) Adaptation (also known as 'flexibility', by Fabbricatti and Biancamano 2019), (4) Resources, and (5) Innovation. This categorisation of urban resilience characteristics share some similarities with the circular economy and resilient thinking model of Fabbricatti and Biancamano (2019) who demonstrate their model with seven characteristics, including three new characteristics of: (1) Reflectiveness (also known as 'capacity to learn', by da Silva et al. 2012), (2) Inclusiveness, and (3) Integration; and not including 'innovation'. To summarise and combine these existing studies of multiple sources, and from the extensive reports of 100 Resilient Cities (2018) and the framework of The Rockefeller Foundation and Arup (2014), the seven characteristics of urban resilience are based on the need(s) of the city's various (urban) systems. These are summarised as the followings:(1) Reflective-meaning to \""use past experiences to inform future decisions\"";(2) Resourceful-meaning to \""recognise alternative ways to use resources\"";(3) Inclusive-meaning to \""prioritise broad consultation to create a sense of share ownership in decision making\""; (4) Integrated-meaning to \""bring together a range of distinct systems and institutions\"";(5) Robustness-meaning to have \""well-conceived, constructed, and managed systems\""; (6) Redundant-meaning to \""spare capacity purposefully created to accommodate disruption\""; (7) Flexible-meaning to have \""willingness, ability to adopt alternative strategies in response to changing circumstances\"".Furthermore, in their conceptual framework, da Silva et al. (2012, p. 3) create a network between three key elements of resilience, productivity, and circularity. This conceptual model is also very similar to the one proposed by da Silva et al. (2012) who developed a systems approach specifically to meet the challenges of urban climate change. This model (ibid, p. 3) creates a network of environmental factors, with social issues, risks, and vulnerabilities of the city. They create three central questions of: \""(1) How does the city work? (2) What are the direct and direct impacts?\u2026 (of climate change for their model example), and (3) Who is the least able to respond to shocks and stresses?\"". They later link these factors to the actual purpose of urban systems, reflecting on studies of well-being conducted by Maslow (1971) , Alcamo et al. (2003) , Huitt (2004) . Through these examples, the well-being is then demonstrated (da Silva et al. 2012, p. 6 ) based on five primary characteristics of:1. Basic needs for survival (such as, biological and physiological needs)-also addressing: \""Adequate livelihoods, sufficient nutritious food, access to water, sanitation and shelter, access to goods\""; 2. Security (such as, safety needs)-also addressing: \""Personal safety, security from natural hazards and man-made hazards (terrorism, pandemics), secure resource access, order, law and stability\""; 3. Health (such as. healthy body and mind)-also addressing: \""Feeling well, access to clean air and water, access to health care\""; 4. Good social relations and esteem (such as, belongingness and love needs)also addressing: \""Social cohesion, mutual respect, ability to help others, family, personal relationships, achievement, status, responsibility and reputation\""; and 5. Freedom of choice and action (such as self-actualisation needs)-also addressing:\""Opportunity to be able to achieve what an individual values doing and being, personal growth and fulfilment\"".Another more recent example of characteristics of urban resilience is the one generated as part of the UN Habitat's 'City Resilience Profiling Tool (CRPT)' (2018), which is a general guideline to a range of adversities and events. In their framework conceptualisation, the team at the UN-Habitat (ibid, p. 21) utilise 10 critical factors in building urban resilience. These critical factors are recognised as holistic measures, in order to include a range of considerations. The first factor is for the urban resilience framework to be 'measurable', highlighting both \""tangible and intangible realities that translate into qualitative and quantitative data\u2026[that]\u2026can be analysed\"". The second factor is the inclusion of 'urban systems', the ones that are defined as complex parts of the \""integrated and complex systems of systems, comprised of sectors, people and hazards\u2026and managed through effective governance mechanisms\"". The third factor is the consideration of 'inhabitants', all people who \""live, work, visit, navigate, and/or travel to the city, as we as resident or connected institutions, organisations, businesses, etc.\"". The fourth factor is the importance of 'continuity', particularly including \""maintaining the protection and provision of services, flows, and structures in order to save and preserve inhabitant's lives and livelihoods\"". The fifth factor is recognised as a response to pressures and overcome 'shocks and stresses'. These are highlighted as examples of situations with risks to the city and those that may be \""sudden and slow-burning, natural or human-made, rare and regular, foreseen or not\"". The sixth factor is the important consideration of 'transforming', referring mostly to those examples of \""adopting proactive, forward-looking attitudes that turn challenges into opportunities for growth\"". These mean the methods of transformational progression(s), those that can change the situation by generating incremental and supporting transformations. The seventh factor is the recognition of 'sustainability' and its practices to include a wide range of community development factors, innovations, economic generation, and services support. This leads to the eighth factor that addresses the importance of 'access', referring to what eventually devises a range of actions, guidelines, and recommendations, those that would essentially be implementable in practice. Finally, all these eight factors feed into the two important factors of 'planning' and 'action'. Through the right planning methods, we can create effective strategies and enhance the city in order to \""tackle\u2026[a wide range of]\u2026vulnerabilities and strengthen capacities to function effectively and efficiently\"". And through actions, we are able to provide reliable and constructive assessments for the support of those strategic planning and responsiveness to the situation. Such an approach would also provide possibilities to provide inclusiveness and take into consideration a multi-sectoral approach to combat challenges. In doing so, we are able to respond to the needs of various stakeholders through their involvement. These are then represented into six distinct characteristics of urban resilience (UN-Habitat 2018), namely (1) persistent, (2) adaptable, (3) inclusive, (4) integrated, (5) reflexive, and (6) transformative-which indicate some overlaps with other studies of urban resilience charactertisation. Furthermore, this model (ibid, p. 22, 23) represents three factors of what comprises the idea of resilient (i.e. persistent, adaptable, inclusive). It also embraces three distinct processes, reflecting on how these can be achieved (i.e. integrated, reflective, and transformative). In reality, the UN-Habitat's model of characteristics of urban resilience, articulating urban resilience through describing \""WHAT comprises being resilient-by being persistent, adaptable, and inclusive-and the processes on HOW these can be achieved-through being integrated, reflexive and transformative\"" (UN-Habitat 2018, p. 22, 23) . Hence, it allows for a holistic thinking to resilience thinking:Under WHAT aspects, these characteristics include (ibid, p. 23):Persistent-A persistent city anticipates impacts in order to prepare itself for current and future shocks and stresses. It builds robustness by incorporating coping mechanisms to withstand disturbances and protect people and assets. It encourages redundancy in its networks by generating spare capacity and back-ups to maintain and restore basic services, ensuring reliability during and after disruption.Adaptable-An adaptable city considers not only foreseeable risks, but also accepts current and future uncertainty. Going beyond redundancy, it diversifies its services, functions and processes by establishing alternatives. It is resourceful in its capacity to repurpose human, financial and physical capital. It pursues a flexibility that encourages it to absorb, adjust and evolve in the face of changing circumstances, dynamically responding by turning change into opportunity.Inclusive-An inclusive city centers on people by understanding that being resilient entails protecting each person from any negative impact. Recognising that people in vulnerable situations are among the most affected by hazards, it actively strives towards social inclusion by promoting equality, equity and fulfilment of human rights. It fosters social cohesion and empowers comprehensive and meaningful participation in all governance processes in order to develop resilience.Similarly, under HOW aspects, these characteristics include (ibid, p. 23):Integrated-An integrated city appreciates that it is composed of and influenced by indivisible, interdependent and interacting systems. It combines and aligns many lenses to ensure input is holistic, coherent and mutually supportive towards a common cause. It enables a transdisciplinary collaboration that encourages open communication and facilitates strategic coordination. It supports the collective functioning of the city and guarantees far-reaching, positive and durable change.Reflexive-A reflexive city understands that its system and surroundings are continuously changing. It is aware that past trends have shaped current urban processes yet appreciates its potential to transform through shocks and stresses over time. It is reflective, conveying the capacity to learn from knowledge, past experiences and new information. It also learns by doing and installs mechanisms to iteratively examine progress as well as systematically update and improve structures.Transformative-A transformative city adopts a proactive approach to building resilience in order to generate positive change. It actively strives to alleviate and ultimately eradicate untenable circumstances. It fosters ingenuity and pursues forward-looking, innovative solutions that over time create a system that is no longer prone to risk. A transformative city is focused and goal-oriented towards a shared vision of the resilient city.In the UN-Habitat's model (ibid, p. 26, 27) , the implementation process of urban resilience is realised as a method of data collection, information processing, assessment, and response. Such a system is designed in a way to fit with a wide range of spatial levels, including \""multiple city scales, geographies, and types\"". This then requires the specification of available data and materials for the exact conditions and the feasibility of what responses may be needed. In a way, this provides a profiling approach that needs to be integrated and holistic. It also reveals a range of aspects that are crucial to the context and the strategies needed at the (local) decision-making level (ibid, p. 26):The definition of the assessment boundaries can be determined by the local government, based on the mandate of the local government and the relevance of the analysis in the context. The diagnosis assesses multiple geo-spatial areas and scope, as such, obtaining an understanding of decentralisation aspects is essential in our approach to clarify the administrative and financial competences of the local government. The expressions 'city', 'city area' and 'urban area' are employed throughout the tool to refer to the study area. Similarly, 'local government' refers to the government entity level that has jurisdiction over the considered study area.The arguments here lead to the development of a holistic model, one that puts urban systems in a systematic network, and ideally in a network of networks. The implementation process then takes up the opportunity to have an iterative process that is analytical and action-driven. This requires multiple engagement activities, multiple assessment and measurements, careful monitory, and careful development of action plans in a process. This process is described in five stages (ibid, pp. 27-36) , starting from 'initiation and training' that offers evaluation and collaborative opportunities for implementation of urban resilience planning. In the next stage, 'data collection and diagnosis' are considered as key aspects of \""gathering the relevant data and ensuring its traceability is an essential step in building resilience\"". This stage is then processed through data collection of four sets of (1) City ID, (2) Local Governments and Stakeholders, (3) Shocks, Stresses, and Challenges, and (4) Urban elements (ibid). Each of these sets is then provided with a set of guidelines, addressing specific elements under each set of data collection. The third stage is 'analysis', which is a major part and could be conducted in an iterative process. In the final two stages, we see 'actions for resilience' that itself may require further analysis (again through the iterative process), and lastly 'taking it further' for the actual implementation and urban resilience enhancement.In the same context of the argument, Huck and Monstadt (2019, p. 211) , suggest for \""more interaction and cross-boundary learning between respective knowledge communities\"". In this regard, we can understand the values of strategies and instruments for urban resilience (Acuti et al. 2020) . These require an understanding of a co-creation process, which improves the involvement of multiple city stakeholders (Marana et al. 2019) . Such an approach also enables opportunities to enhance cobenefits of multiple systems, and help to restructure co-planning methods of the city management. Moreover, this allows us to assess resilience not only from its dimensions but also in terms of its application in practice. Hence, it is recommended to have a good understanding of resilience from its comprehensive nature."", ""The Comprehensiveness of Resilience"": ""The first toolkit developed for resilient cities (Siemens et al. 2013; The Rockefeller Foundation and Arup 2014) showcases the comprehensiveness of resilience for the first time (also see 100 Resilient Cities 2018) . This was demonstrated through a multidimensional understanding of resilience as a concept and then was utilised as a unique practice of urban planning and city management. Through this conceptualisation, the multiplicity of urban resilience was demonstrated and then tested for a new toolkit development, addressing what it means to create resilient cities, and why: \u2026[The]\u2026events are playing out against a backdrop of global population growth and urbanization, leading to a complex knot of interrelated pressures. In emerging and established cities alike, these trends are changing the spatial pattern of risk and radically altering perceptions of whether a city is 'safe' or 'well prepared'. Cities have a tremendous challenge to maintain social well-being and economic vitality in the face of these complex, uncertain and constantly changing risks (ibid, p. 3).Through their explanations of urban resilience, they (ibid, pp. 5-7) then highlight three main factors behind \""creating resilient systems\"" in the practice of resilience enhancement, including: (1) Robustness of new and existing infrastructure, (2) Decentralized resource supplies and distribution networks, and (3) Enhanced monitoring and controls. These three pillars are then identified as precursors to creating resilient cities that require a comprehensive action plan. These pillars cover three crucial areas of 'policies', 'governance, and 'finance', which are highlighted as:1. Urban planning and land use policies can direct development in ways that protect people and structures from harm; 2. Governance should take a whole system approach to city management; and 3. Appropriate financing mechanisms are needed to support investments in resilient infrastructure.Further development of this conceptualisation is shaped around multiple dimensions of urban resilience measures, of which four were highlighted to be \""people, Fabbricatti and Biancamano 2019) and the capacity to learn from the past and take appropriate actions in return. Such an approach should be \""informative, inclusive, integrated, and iterative\"" for the decision making processes of the city management (Siemens et al. 2013; The Rockefeller Foundation and Arup 2014; 100 Resilient Cities 2018) . Therefore, what we create through resilience is not just a product or by-product of multi-sectoral cooperation and interaction, but also a process of making those crucial decisions at the time of need. As a result, we can argue that the comprehensiveness of resilience, and urban resilience, in particular, is a reflection of the complex city operations. Such complexity of operations can be expressed and developed through decision-making processes, policy demands (Davidson et al. 2019) , and planning strategies that define the overall mechanism of city management.To summarise, there are indeed a range of resilience values (of which educational was discussed here), dimensions, and characteristics that define the comprehensiveness of resilience. They portray an array of resilient systems, resilient measures, and resilient governance-all together can highlight the importance of resilience in urban planning and the practice of making cities more resilient. The various global examples, of which we only showed a few here, are valuable lessons for us to know exactly 'what does resilience mean for the case of emergencies?', and of particular, how can we develop it in the case of disease outbreak events? Undoubtedly, and as expressed in the previous chapters, in such events we deal with a different set of resilience issues; those that may require a procedural approach to be implemented and enhanced, and those that may stretch over multiple stages of the outbreak progression. However, the commonalities between what has been discussed in this section and what is proposed in the following sections are significant; and therefore, what we have in hand is a comprehensive approach to city management-something that is conceptualised in theory, nourished with the literature of cross-disciplines and multiple sectors, and is finally nurtured in the practice of resilience. In the following section and its subsequent sub-sections, and by utilising the knowledge gained from the existing urban resilience studies, we demonstrate a novel urban resilience framework mainly applicable for the case of disease outbreak events."", ""Conceptualising a \""Comprehensive Urban Resilience"": ""Framework\""In facing the disease outbreak event, the city needs to be fully prepared and it should respond in the most effective way. The city faces new adversity and it should recognise its reactions are precarious. In the case of failure, the city may face a deadly situation of high mortality rates and high infected cases, costly in every sector, and harder to reconcile. The city may become fragmented, chaotic scene, and uncontrollable with prevalent disorders and dysfunctional systems. It is then that the city may gradually collapse, and it may continue to suffer for a long time. Its failure can become widespread, and may even have lager global impacts. If the city fails, its operations will fail, and then its governance will become fragile. This is no longer a case of an outbreak. The situation may turn into a disaster, with sirens in every moment of the day, emergencies in every corner, and raids in every community. There are no unbroken shops, there is no security in place, and there is no support. The destructive damages are then beyond those preliminary disruptions. The city will fail its residents, and the hardships will become unbearable through the flames of anxiety, insecurity, fear, and distress. This is how we can negatively portray a city without an urban resilience plan. This can happen to any city and there are no exceptions ( Fig. 3 .1). However, in the face of such possible calamitous probabilities, the following framework is proposed to overcome the above issues (see Subsect. 3.3.2, and Fig. 3 .2), and expectantly, not to let such failures happen in the situation of the disease outbreak. The period of the outbreak would certainly be disruptive and impactful (not in a positive way), and hence we require to have a holistic review and assessment of all aspects associated with urban resilience. The eventual outcomes would feed into the all-embracing action plan and strategies at the city management level. As discussed already, impacts from the event should be assessed throughout its progression, and all units/sectors should react in a continuous process of being reflective and adaptive. This requires a thought-through planning, a step-by-step evaluation, and preparedness of multiple factors. Each stage differs from the other stages, and each sector would also require certain needs or face certain challenges at different times of the outbreak progression. These factors have to be addressed holistically from both perspectives of individual sectors and the integration between them that is seemingly more viable on such occasions. The approach requires to be an indicator-based approach of urban resilience enhancement, enabling the opportunity to assess the progress and evaluate any shortcomings and challenges. Therefore, an indicatorbased approach provides the opportunity for measurement, monitory, and regular (but careful and reflective) adjustments to specific parts or targets of the overall plan. Also by having an \""interrelated system of indicators\"", as suggested by Fabbricatti and Biancamano (2019, p. 7), we can have a better overview of assessment and interpretation of the city complexities. Those complexities that can be regarded as measuring the city's performance and its capacity (Huang et al. 2015) , similar to standalone urban sustainable development goals (USDGs), in order to make cities and human settlements \""inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable\"" (Klopp and Petretta 2017, p. 92) . By defining these measures, we can propose a set of precise targets (or target groups), specific applications for diverse actors and systems, and a practical guideline for the time of need. In doing so, the framework would help to enhance the monitory and control measures of the outbreak progress, and propose for an all-inclusive resilience enhancement. It is important to note that the central element of 'enhancement' is extremely crucial, as it responds to not only what is needed (or should be added), but also what is already in place and requires improvement or further attention. Such considerations would depend on the conditions of the context, as well as the availability of institutions, operational units, and multi-sectoral ecosystem of the place/city. Earlier in this chapter, we explored resilience from multiple perspectives and a range of multiple aspects. Consequently, we highlighted the characteristics of both resilience and then urban resilience, and how they play their parts in both the conceptualisation of resilient systems and the practice of resilient city. Therefore, the way in which operationalisation of urban resilience (Heinzlef et al. 2019 ) takes place, can be developed as a territorial approach, or even through spatio-temporal, and sociotemporal methods (Hogg et al. 2016; Komugabe-Dixson et al. 2019; Jiang et al. 2020) or patterns (Ma et al. 2019; Aswi et al. 2020 ) of monitory and enhancement of the city. Nevertheless, Marana et al. (2019) argue that there is a general lack of operationalisation frameworks for the development of resilience in cities-something that is also addressed in this book. This approach includes the perspective of supply and demand (Sun et al. 2019) , and how cities will need to continuously adapt to healthy transitions, if not major transformations. Thus, any resilience approach ought to be as holistic as possible to be able to adapt to a 'systemic approach' to a particular territory or location (ibid). This requires an integrative approach to resilience thinking, one that encompasses a range of considerations. These are expected to be arranged in a hierarchical set-up as we may change our responses or may simply alter the priorities of our operations and management. The city has its specific dynamism, and undeniably a very complex one, too. Hence, it is important to allow flexibility in such resilience planning that can support potential adjustments or amendments, when and where needed throughout the outbreak progression.In the following two sub-sections, we first explore more about the available frameworks and what they offer and then introduce the new comprehensive framework of urban resilience in the event of an outbreak. In here, the summaries of existing studies and global examples provide invaluable observation and knowledge about this important topic-particularly that it is evident that outbreak events are exceptional cases or occasions, but they potentially can cause substantial damage to the society. Besides all these impacts, it is important to support how the city can manage during such adversities, and how the preparedness can be in place to support the overall responsiveness of the overall stakeholder constellation of the city management, public and private sectors, communities, businesses, etc. Through only a few examples that are explored here, we extract a range of commonalities and significant values that could eventually help to define what can be regarded as an explicit urban resilience framework for the outbreak events. The aim is a two-sided matter: first to reduce the negative impacts on the city, and second to reduce the vulnerabilities. By addressing these two, we are able to strengthen the city in need."", ""Available Frameworks: What do They Offer?"": ""Current available urban resilience frameworks are mostly applicable to a variety of emergencies and disasters (The World Bank 2012; 100 Resilient Cities 2018; UN-Habitat 2018), and some are specifically designed to combat climate change impacts or natural disasters (ADB 2014). In all these global examples, outbreak and epidemic/pandemic events are either just mentioned as a category (for example in The World Bank 2012) or are not included at all. Through all examples, we see little attention is given to this global matter of biological classification, which can be recognised as frequent and disruptive adversity. Much of the work around urban resilience framework in disease outbreak events are either included as part of those overarching frameworks and tools (few examples named above) or are merely a set of guidelines and recommendations that may not be necessarily specific enough to address the resilience of multiple systems and sectors in the city. They usually appear as general guidelines or national strategies, which are somewhat different from what a city-level framework normally includes. Hence, there are certain limitations in the practicality of those frameworks, specifically for the outbreak events. In all cases, however, there is consideration of multiple aspects that show the capacity to have an integrated approach to urban resilience (Chelleri and Olazabal 2012; Olazabal et al. 2012 In their all-inclusive city resilience framework (CRF), the Rockefeller Foundation and Arup (2014) developed an invaluable set of essential urban systems that highlight the complexity of cities from various drivers and necessities to the city. Their developed CRF then includes four dimensions of \""(1) Health and Well-being, (2) Economy and Society, (3) Infrastructure and Environment; and (4) Leadership and Strategy\"", with each dimension comprised of \""three drivers, which reflect the actions cities can take to improve their resilience\"" (ibid; also 100 Resilient Cities 2018). These drivers include:1 Under 'Health and Well-being': \""Everyone living and working in the city has access to what they need to survive and thrive\"", including:1.1 Meet basic needs (which are suggested as methods to: \""particularly in times of crisis, ensure that people have access the basic resources necessary to survive-food, water and sanitation, energy, and shelter\""). 1.2 Support livelihoods and employment (which are suggested as mechanisms to: \""assist individuals to access diverse livelihood and employment opportunities, including access to business investment and social welfare. This includes skills and training, fair labour policy, and development and innovation\""). 1.3 Ensure public health services (which are suggested as plans to: \""provide access to effective public healthcare and emergency services to safeguard physical and mental health. This includes medical practitioners and plans, as well as clinics and ambulances\"").2. Under 'Economy and Society': \""The social & financial systems that enable urban populations to live peacefully, and act collectively\"", including:2.1 Promote cohesive and engaged communities (which are suggested as methods to: \""create a sense of collective identity and mutual support. This includes building a sense of local identity, social networks, and safe space; promoting features of an inclusive local cultural heritage; and encouraging cultural diversity while promoting tolerance and a willingness to accept other cultures\""). 2.2 Ensure social stability, security, and justice (which are suggested as mechanisms to: \""ensure a comprehensive and inclusive approach to law enforcement and justice that fosters a stable, secure, and just society. This includes fair and transparent policing and deterrents to crime-specifically in times of crisis, as well as enforcement of laws such as codes and regulations\""). 2.3 Foster economic prosperity (which are suggested as plans to: \""ensure the availability of funding and a vibrant economy as a result of diverse revenue streams, the ability to attract business investment, and contingency plans. This involves good governance, integration with the regional and global economy and measures to attract investment\"").3. Under 'Infrastructure and Environment': \""The man-made and natural systems that provide critical services, protect, and connect urban assets enabling the flow of goods, services, and knowledge\"", including:3.1 Provide and enhance protective natural and man-made assets (which are suggested as methods to: \""maintain protective natural and man-made assets that reduce the physical vulnerability of city systems. This includes natural systems like wetlands, mangroves and sand dunes or built infrastructure like sea walls or levees\""). The examples of urban resilience frameworks, developed globally by major organisations, or nationally as part of national strategies, initiatives or guidelines, and in academia through conceptualisation and theory. They represent a wide range of resilience thinking and approaches that address adversities of various types. However, by decoding them carefully, we can see common messages that suggest a holistic approach that needs to be: inclusive, integrated, reflective, and systematic. Therefore, in the first steps of developing an explicit framework, we have to take into consideration four key aspects, including: (1) the playfulness of synergies between multiple sectors and the effectiveness of integration between them, (2) the comprehensiveness of the overall structure that includes an adequate range of urban systems and measures, (3) the positions and values of stakeholders and multiple means of engagement and empowerment, and (4) the system-based mechanism for institutions that suggest a persistent network of analytical information, infrastructures, materials, and knowledge. In the following sub-section, we put together the above assessed knowledge into a major proposition, which is the development of a novel urban resilience framework against the outbreak events."", ""The New Framework: What Can We Offer?"": ""Frameworks are known to be effective instruments, which can demonstrate a comprehensive plan in urbanism, city management, and governance. On many occasions, it is the lack of planning and framework that reduces the effectiveness of urban resilience measures (in practice). Even if those measures are in place, they may not be easily implementable without a central mechanism or structure. Hence, by having a comprehensive assessment of multiple factors, a framework seems to be a vital instrument to enhance the city's resilience, boost its preparedness, and implement its resilient strategies. A framework development should occur in a procedural approach (Fig. 3.1) , understanding what needs to be assessed at first. Those factors may be essentialities of the context, or externalities that would nurture the idea of 'resilient thinking'. It is then through a reflective approach that indicators and dimensions are developed, before we can suggest how they can be integrated by a breakdown of target groups. This procedural approach summaries the urban resilience framework that should capture the realities and respond to them effectively and efficiently.In the first step, we have to verify the main structure of the framework, which is generated from an indicator-based system. In this structure, we define major groups of indicators and categorise them based on their relational position to urban systems. In this regard, the urban resilience indicators are defined into two distinct (indicator) categories of 'management indicators', and 'provision indicators'. These are selected through an analysis of the city's complex systems and arrangements; through which, we can assess what can be regarded as a matter of management, and what can be identified as a provision matter. This categorisation enables us to distinguish what needs to be managed from multiple levels and by multiple actors, and what should be provided and by whom. The management indicators are central to city management structures, of which we can include a range of relevant commissions, organisations, bureaus, and municipal or district-level authorities (depending on the scale of the city). On the other hand, the provision indicators are essentialities of cities that include a range of public and private sectors, businesses, and a wider range of stakeholders in the city. The management indicators are meant to help the city by reducing the negative impacts of the outbreak event and its progression, The procedural approach to urban resilience framework development, from assessment stage and including externalities to resilience thinking of the specific situation and context, to stages of reflection, integration, and development. These include the steps of identifying and categorising indicators, development of dimensions, and allocating relevant target groups for each of those defined dimensions of the urban resilience framework. Source The Author's while the provision indicators are meant to enhance the city's capacity to reduce the vulnerabilities of multiple sectors and groups (in the city)."", ""Reflection"": ""In the second step, and expanded from the initial categorisation of indicators, we define the main dimensions of each category. In this regard, we identify two critical dimensions for each of the indicator categories. For management indicators, the two dimensions are regarded as 'operational' and 'institutional' dimensions, both representing the crucial factors of the city management. For provision indicators, the two dimensions are identified as 'services' and 'supplies' dimensions, both reflecting on the needs and necessities of the society and urban system operations. In doing so, we distinguish in a reflective manner how each of these dimensions then comes with specific needs, pressures, and vulnerabilities. For operational and institutional dimensions, we identify certain factors that feed back to the overall management matters. Subsequently, for services and supplies dimensions, the same applies that reflect on the provision factors and those essentialities of the city. The identification of urban resilience dimensions is important in terms of multiple aspects, which address: In this process of dimension selection, we have to match questions of 'what', 'how' and 'whom' to their right sectors and in most cases to multiple sectors in each dimension. Hence, integration is essential, which allows us to have a holistic plan that encompasses a wide range of operations, institutions, services, and supplies.In the third step, we allocate specific target groups for each dimension. In this arrangement, each dimension consists of two specific target groups, and with one main target group shared between two dimensions of a singular indicator category; i.e. a total of three target groups per dimension, or a total of five target groups in each indicator pillar. In reality, the shared approach in one key target group provides a mechanism for the synergies between two dimensions of each indicator category. The breakdown is in the following. For the operational dimension, the two specific target groups are 'asset management' and 'services management', both responding to the most important groups under the operational needs of the city in the outbreak. For the institutional dimension, the two specific target groups are 'media management' and 'economic management', both responding to more socio-economic aspects of management and from the broader understanding of institution enhancement. The shared target group between the two dimensions is the overarching 'healthcare management', which is a crucial target group embedded in both operations and institutions of the city, and particularly in the outbreak event. In addition, in the indicator category of provision, we have a similar layout of target groups. For the services dimension, the two specific target groups are 'transportation services', and 'safety and security services', reflecting on primary services of the city operations from the perspective of the services. For the supplies dimension, the two specific target groups are 'food supply' and 'amenities supply', carefully including those primary needs of the society and multiple sectors. The shared target group between the two dimensions is the predominant target group of 'social services', which itself is comprised of multiple factors and sub-target groups. The social services target group includes the often neglected factors in the event of an outbreak, hence it is important to include it as a shared target group in between the two dimensions of services and supplies. The above breakdown of indicator categories, dimensions, and target groups is provided through a comprehensive urban resilience framework, specifically developed for the context of the city (Figs. 3.2 and 3.3) . It is also applicable to smaller communities or cities of various sizes, yet it should be carefully adapted and reflected on the actual context and conditions of the outbreak event (and its progression). The breakdown of this proposed urban resilience framework is demonstrated in Figs. 3.2 and 3.3. The following two Sects. 3.4 and 3.5 will delve into all factors associated with both dimensions of management and provision."", ""Understanding the 'Management' Indicator Category"": ""In this section, we elaborate on all target groups under the main indicator category of 'management' and its two dimensions of operational and institutional. Regardless of the type of outbreak, and even from the examples of non-human disease outbreaks, we deal with certain issues of large-scale disturbances and the implications for management practices (de Groot et al. 2018) . Hence, the actual momentum is recognised as a disruptive period. The situation also encompasses a range of management issues that require urgent attention in order to sustain the performances of various systems in place. For human-related disease outbreaks, there are examples of unknown and sudden outbreaks (Schuster and Newland 2015; Ansumana et al. 2017; Lowe et al. 2019; Shears and Garavan 2020) as well those that are more common or seasonal (Firestone et al. 2012; Pires Maciel et al. 2014; Ohuabunwo et al. 2016; Godefroy et al. 2018; Rizkalla et al. 2020 ) but often occur in a sudden instance, too. The situation escalates further once the outbreak expands further to become an epidemic or even a pandemic situation. Some of these cases are novel in terms of the disease characteristics (Wang et al. 2012 ) and transmissions; meaning that they require a set of watchful control and management measures. The occurrence of such events, and the upsurge in their frequency and intensity, are alarming factors for the overall management of the situations as well as the management of the systems. Undoubtedly, there are certain conflict and control issues (Shears and Garavan 2020) that reflect on issues of community involvement, response programme development, strategy enhancement, integration of plan to existing health structure, and enhancement of response effectiveness. These aspects require management not only at the top, or from a top-down approach, but also at multiple sectors or systems and sometimes at the bottom levels.Nevertheless, it is recommended that management remains mostly top-down in such incidences and for the case of strengthening the institutional networks. In doing so, management should sustain its position to help better monitory and control of the outbreak and its progression. But more important than all, is that in all management target groups, it is essential to include and maintain three main management considerations of: (1) risk management, (2) control and monitory management, and (3) general management.Through 'risk management', all associated risks of individual and collective sectors should be carefully assessed at multiple stages, through both preparedness and responsiveness (when needed). Risk management should include, in particular, the management of emergency services (which also come under the provision indicators). This should include probable plans for evacuation management, with the need for higher-level intervention in a possible escalated event. This planning would require a feasibility assessment as it may require the support of multi-level management, those that may include national and international organisations. Nonetheless, risk management can include multiple aspects, too. For instance, Smith (2006) suggests a combined approach, which is developed on the role of risk perceptions, communication, and management-an integrated plan that could support policy development, too. In another example, Hassani et al. (2019) propose a model that deals with the risk of disease emergence (and spread), which is a combined approach of risk management, signal processing, and econometrics. In all cases, there is a need for risk measurement, and forecasting scenarios of outbreak progression.Through 'control and monitory management', it is essential to have continuous or regular checks that include both control and monitory measures. In this practice, it is essential to include a range of prevention services or even crisis prevention measures (Choi and Kim 2016) that can fully cover the management of the outbreak, which should help to avoid reaching a crisis stage. As part of prevention services, the foremost example is having structured isolation management in place, which is more practical at smaller scales of various range (Anderson 2009; Risa et al. 2009; Dom\u00e9nech-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2020 ) even though it can get prolonged and costly (Danial et al. 2016) . At the city level, it is important to have a systematic investigation planning in place (Korte et al. 2016) , which can increase the efficiency of monitory and detection methods. In doing so, we can promote case management (Ohuabunwo et al. 2016 ) from various viewpoints of on-site mobilisation, training development, management of care-providers, and rapid containment planning. Moreover, in order to promote control and monitory management, it is also vital to utilise the integrated digital platforms (from the experience of COVID-19) and have agent-based models in order to detect multiple important outbreak patterns, such as (case) mobility, growing symptoms, transmissions, etc. Finally, in all these examples, it is crucial to sustaining control and monitory measures across all management sectors of urban systems. Some of these prevention measures/services, should develop as isolation management plans, and if required, with urgent need of collective measures and management practice across multiple sectors or systems of the city. This means isolation management should be embedded in the overall management plan.Lastly, through 'general management', it is essential to sustain the generalities of management demand, such as those supply and demand factors that can feed into policy adaption and policy implementation. Such an approach to policies should include the development of general public guidelines, general public education, enhanced control, as well as the development of restrictions and further inspection (if needed). The general management should act as a major mechanism in between multiple objectives and multiple criteria of urban systems, to ensure their management is monitored, supported, and updated (or adjusted) in the times of need. Here, the primary functions of general management are beyond the usual finance, marketing, and operations. In the outbreak, the general management ought to maintain a range of activities that can promote the involvement of a larger group of stakeholders who can feed into the critical factors of planning, strategy development, conflict management, and decision making.In the following five Subsects. 3.4.1-3.4.5, we explore all five individual management target groups, across two dimensions of 'operational' and 'institutional'. As expressed previously, while these target groups are recognised as individual systems or factors of the overall (city) management, they should also be seen collectively, and if not, at least in integrative thinking. This is certainly realised as a crucial factor for the enhancement of urban resilience from the perspective of multiple management."", ""Operational Dimension-M1: Asset Management"": ""Asset management is all-encompassing management that includes a range of products, values, investments, and the overall profile of one's resources. While it is a terminology mostly used in the finance sector, it is highly important for the operational dimension of urban resilience, particularly that it provides a wide-range understanding of urban resources. More broadly, asset management can include asset vulnerability framework (Moser 1998) , asset allocation and performance (Sharpe 1992) , and measures that address issues of maintenance, replacement, and reliability (Jardine and Tsang 1973) . The latter is the crossover between two crucial aspects of maintenance management and physical asset management, from the understanding of productivity and maintenance. In urban resilience, it is important to have an overview of what is available? In what capacity are they available? And how they can be maintained as resources for better resilience? Hence, asset management can play a major part in how we identify necessary resources, and then manage where and how we should allocate them in the practice of preparedness and the later responsiveness.In her presentation on issues of asset management in cities, Mian (2018) profoundly connected the dots between urban resilience development, city-scale governance, and asset management (from the general resilience perspective). She addressed how asset management cannot be dealt with in the isolation of individual sectors, but should be seen holistically across multiple sectors of urban resilience. Hence, there is a need for us to identify how we assess our assets and how we then manage them in the case of city preparedness through urban resilience enhancement. The asset management decisions should be made across multiple sectors and in line with the critical infrastructures' resilience plan. Similarly, other examples link asset management to measures of risk management and risk reduction that enable the possibility for urban resilience enhancement. For instance, AECOM (2020) explores a range of representative services, comprised of critical infrastructure protection, physical security and hardening, climate change adaptation, cybersecurity, disaster risk reduction, hazard mitigation planning, and disaster recovery. In all cases, they (ibid) highlight the position of asset and asset management in the practice of urban resilience, by addressing: \""investment in resilience today means protection and cost avoidance in the future. We help clients and communities around the world build resilience through an extensive understanding of assets, risks, and vulnerabilities\"". This is similar to earlier reports by Mitchell and Harris (2012) , who described resilience as a risk management approach. They included asset management as part of risk management across multiple policy areas, suggesting how they can support the plan for resilience enhancement. This is a reflection on asset resilience and how it helps to reduce the vulnerabilities through prompt management (MMI Engineering webpage 2020); i.e. asset as a service to help to manage the risk. In their narrative, assets are valuable for resilience and the resilience of assets are valuable for good operations (ibid) . Other examples are those that relate to specific sectors, such as building community resilience (Municipal Affairs of Alberta 2015), transportation asset management scenarios (US Department of Transportation 2013), or understanding infrastructure resilience from the perspective of asset management (New South Wales Government webpage 2020). In the latter, the argument is that \""infrastructure resilience is focused on the resilience planned for, designed and built into assets, networks and systems\"", namely those assets that deliver \""positive service or amenity to their communities e.g. transport infrastructure, water and wastewater, stormwater drainage, waste facilities, dams, community buildings, etc.\"" (ibid). Therefore, we can argue asset management plays a major part in general city operations, particularly in the time of outbreak events.To summarise what needs to be taken into consideration for asset management, we argue in terms of the overall operationalisation perspective (Marana et al. 2019) , which includes a variety of systems, resources, and capacities at the city level. Hence, we should include factors that include human resource management, particularly for those weaker healthcare systems or those who lack enough human power to handle the outbreak event. The boosting support from human resources will be a major asset for the overall operational factors, and as such, it is evident that early assessment of assets would help to overcome the later problems. One of the other aspects significantly crucial in the event of an outbreak is having a structured plan to implement a well-informed asset resilience index (Argyroudis et al. 2020) , which should be in place to address any damages or deficiencies to the overall asset management. This system-based approach is very much relevant to those specific critical infrastructures, and those that can help to support the operations of the city. In addition, having an adaptive plan in asset management would help to overcome one of the main resilience shortages, which is to ensure having the capacity to adapt or to even transform the urban systems (Cariolet et al. 2019 ). This comprehends a greater understanding of a 'reflective approach' that suggests the systematic property of resilience (ibid), which is particularly relevant to the city operational factors. Moreover, it is important to put together a combined approach of resilience-based infrastructure planning and asset management, as proposed by Rasoulkhani et al. (2019) . Again, this approach responds to those supply and demand mechanisms and the overall operational needs of the city. Lastly, and more importantly, we can argue that much of the asset management comes down to resource management (Berg and Nycander 1997) . Hence, it is crucial to have a holistic plan of resource-asset management that is multi-sectoral, multi-objective, and multi-spatial."", ""Operational Dimension-M2: Services Management"": ""As critical as it sounds, services management is commonly recognised as the backbone of city operations. Services themselves are identified as one of the two dimensions of provision indicators. But for the specific target group of 'services management', we have to understand how services should be managed, and how they play their part from the operational perspective. The city normally operates through a range of daily operational services, some can be in full operations and some are partial, seasonal, and temporary. Their management plays a major part in how they run, as well as how they may impact the societal need. Hence, the management aspect should consider the basic services (Etinay et al. 2018) , and if not all. In the case of emergency, the management may exclude secondary services, usually the ones that run in parallel to the basic services as they either support the secondary activities or merely maintain the sustainability of the basic operational activities. Therefore, the basic services are defined as the most accessible ones ) and are usually the ones essential for the daily needs of society. In most cases, infrastructure and services come together (The World Bank 2012; Ogie et al. 2017; Chaturverdi et al. 2019) , suggesting how they jointly address the primary needs of city operation.In urban resilience, services management refers to the enhancement of societal resilience (Marana et al. 2019) . This needs to develop through a co-creation process, holistically planned to involve a larger body of stakeholders (ibid). In return, the co-benefits of each service management criteria should ideally reflect on the development of an integrated management system. At first, we may require to take on a board a multi-service differentiation plan (Wang et al. 2020 ) before the middle stage of service management co-creation through integration, and the later stage of network development for multi-services management. Hence, this needs to develop into a holistic services management system (SMS), which is defined as an inclusive management system bringing together a range of organisation management aspects, such as planning, policies, strategies, objectives, documentation, and processes. Developed first in manufacturing and then vastly utilised in the information technology systems, services management (for cities), can be an integration between operational aspects of production and activities with information-based processes. Hence, there is an evident advantage of utilising this particular system of multi-management and integrate it with a digital platform for operational monitory purposes.In the case of an outbreak, services management can be a flexible platform for control and monitory of operations in a multi-aspect approach. There are also some minor overlaps with the earlier asset management target plan, which refer to services as resources for operation. In smart city examples, we can see such a mechanism as integrated management of public services (Smart Water Magazine 2019), which is aimed to optimise the operations: \u2026the efficiency in terms of managing new and existing infrastructures has to reach levels previously unseen. This requires the integration of all infrastructure, both public and private, with regard to operation and maintenance. The purpose is to have a sensible impact and improve the quality of life of citizens.However, we must conduct a feasibility assessment to certify the effectiveness of such an integrated management system model, or aim to enhance the capacity of multi-management approach when needed. This should be seen beyond the typical provision of quality services, as it ought to undertake the role of management beyond just one sector or one need. Similar to those water services management examples (highlighted in Katko et al. 2013) , a system approach of multi-services management would help to strengthen the governance of public services. This approach indicates a move away from risk management to resilience management of services, one that can boost the \""deployment of crucial services\"" (Linkov et al. 2014) in the time of emergency. There are some similarities of such approach with those in ecosystem services and social-ecological systems (Lundberg and Moberg 2003; Briggs et al. 2012 Briggs et al. , 2015 , which indicate the benefits of multi-management approaches in the resilience paradigm, particularly in the sub-field of resilience planning. To summarise, in the case of an outbreak, services management should enhance the operational robustness, particularly in public services. The approach, as expressed through other resilience examples, should be integrated into a multisectoral and multi-management mechanism. Through a co-creation approach, the mechanism should develop a dynamic network-based system for resources, basic services, critical infrastructures, productions, and primary city operations."", ""Operational/Institutional Dimensions-M3: Healthcare Management"": ""A major management aspect of outbreak events is healthcare management, which is jointly shared between operational and institutional dimensions of management. In reality, the healthcare system is a major player in outbreak events, particularly that it requires to provide a variety of aspects, including health care services, resources, physical support (infrastructure), facilities, emergency services, isolation support, health care logistic response (Cutter et al. 2010 ), etc. In many cases, healthcare units become obvious hotspots of disease outbreak, and their workforces and units are usually subject to high(er) risk of disease transmission (Ghebrehewet et al. 2016; Hiller et al. 2019; Orsi et al. 2019; Taori et al. 2019 ). The healthcare system generally receives one of the early sudden shockwaves of the outbreak. In return, they face a higher probability of becoming a vulnerable system at the early stage(s) of disease outbreak progression. If not managed well, the impacts on health systems can cause other issues that may have a wider societal impact (Johnston et al. 2007; Elston et al. 2016 ). This may even cause further psychological and emotional issues that may increase the society's level of anxiety; also often leading to extreme examples of health conditions (Atkinson et al. 2009 ). But despite the difficulties it may face, the healthcare system plays a vital part in the delivery of health services to the general public. In the case of an outbreak event, it is crucial to monitor the quantity and quality of healthcare units and centers; hence, careful management is essential. Kruk et al. (2015) also suggest how fragile the healthcare system can become during disease epidemic situations, highlighting the ways we should enhance the resilience of the health systems to ensure their preparedness and continuity in operation and services. In reality, the management of the healthcare system is invaluable as part of the primary city preparedness measures.In urban resilience enhancement, we ought to comprehend healthcare management as both an operational matter and an institutional factor. Healthcare is an operational target group based on its position in dealing with relevant training, treatment, control, and even containment procedures. It is also an institutional target group (i.e. identified as a healthcare system), which is defined as a formal structure comprised of multiple aspects. These aspects include certain associated organisations, workforce units, people and actions, principally intended to maintain, restore, or promote health. It should not be mistaken with health infrastructures and/or facilities (e.g. hospitals, clinics, etc.) as healthcare is broadly described as a system more than just the facilities it should normally offer. Also, there is a common misinterpretation between the two primary terminologies of 'healthcare system', and 'public health', which in reality, are linked together in resilience thinking. However, public health is closely linked with factors of governance, regulation, and support. It is also defined as a branch of medicine, which includes disease prevention (Hall et al. 2011) or crisis prevention (Quah and Lee 2004) as one of its mainstreams. The other main difference between the two terminologies is the focus areas that define them more clearly. While public health focuses more on disease prevention, it mostly focuses on safety measures and health improving mechanisms. It is also commonly used as a platform to detect health issues and provide necessary responses at the time of need. On the other hand, the healthcare system or health system is the actual capacity of operations. At the same time, it is a major institution within the array of public services and urban systems. Hence, during the outbreak, its management requires a two-sided approach, both as part of the city operations and also as the institution that supports the delivery of health care services. In their studies, Lurie and Fermont (2009) suggest building bridges between health care and public health, including also the associated medical care systems (Woolf 2013 ) that are vital to cases such as the outbreak event. In their recommendations, Lurie and Fermont (2009) highlight the importance of synergies between health care and public health, including the possibility to integrate the two in practice. As such, they argue in favour of the \""effectiveness of shared efforts between health professionals and other stakeholders, including community-based organisations (COBs) and health plans\"" (ibid).Resilience, as an integrative construct (Zautra et al. 2010) , should ultimately sustain the health and well-being of the society in the case of an outbreak. This should help to further develop the capacity of public health and its effectiveness in practice, including specific programmes and interventions that are specifically designed for the promotion of health and societal well-being (ibid). If healthcare management is not sustained promptly, it can eventually fail the healthcare system and its services. This will lead to a shortage of workforces, shortage of medical support, shortage of treatment support, and many health disadvantages that can intensify the adversities of the outbreak event. The immediate impacts can be increased in the number of infected cases and mortality rates. As a result, healthcare management would need to sustain all healthcare operations. In return, the healthcare system should persistently operate as a fundamental institution in support of public health and medical demand (particularly in the case of emergency). It should also continue with optimal quality of medical care, providing support to those in need for various health conditions, and not only for the specific disease of the outbreak. The involvement and integration of both private and public sectors would help to increase the health system capacity to ensure all healthcare services are maintained, offered, and managed in the most optimal way. In doing so, we require to aim at safeguarding the society from any risks associated with the outbreak event and provide healthy management of the resilient healthcare services."", ""Institutional Dimension-M4: Media Management"": ""In our age of media control (Rosa and Rosa 2011) , we have to understand the twosided control of media in the case of the outbreak-i.e. how media can control? And how it can be controlled? Such control comes from the idea of media management that signifies the important role of media as an institution, which ought to be influencing and informative. Strongly tangled with public policy and education, media is a playful part of an outbreak, from the dissemination of correct and false news, to strengthen the public trust, reassurances, support, education, etc. The way how media plays its part during the outbreak is very crucial for the maintenance of a societal mindset, educating the general public, and informing them of the guidelines, policies, requirements, and updates of the situation. The consequences of lack of trust in governance may cause adverse impacts on a wide range of areas of policy effectiveness, economic policy, the economy, the economic crisis, compliance(s), accountability, regulations, education, and social capital. Hence, it is important to maintain healthy public diplomacy (extracted from multiple sessions by Algan 2013 , Burns 2013 , Coyle 2013 -all from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) workshop on \""joint learning for an OECD Trust strategy\"" 2013), which is trustworthy in every step and is informative to a larger group of the community.While the sensitivity of the information should be taken into full consideration, it is important to maintain the right level of transparency and community engagement through the right sources of media. The rightfulness of this particular management is vital to avoid any further uncertainties, confusion, fear, and anxiety.Trust in governance is essential from various perspectives, and should be maintained through a robust media management plan. As highlighted by the OECD (2019), there are six areas that governments can increase the public trust, including (1) reliability, (2) responsiveness, (3) openness, (4) better regulation, (5) integrity and fairness, and (6) inclusive policy-making. In each area, there are certain aspects that should be identified and practiced. These are key aspects that can be utilised later on specifically for the practice of media management, and help to increase its effectiveness:-Reliability-governments have an obligation to minimise uncertainty in the economic, social, and political environment; -"", ""Responsiveness-trust in government can depend on citizen's experiences when receiving public services-a crucial factor of trust in government; -Openness-open government policies that concentrate on citizen engagement and access to information can increase public trust; -Better Regulation-proper regulation is important for justice, fairness, and the rule of law as well as in delivering public services; -Integrity and Fairness-integrity is crucial determinant of trust and is essential if governments want to be recognised as clean, fair, and open. -Inclusive Policy Making-understanding how policies are designed can strengthen institutions and promote trust between government and citizens (ibid)."": ""Furthermore, what we can extract from this trust-building strategy are multiple factors of inclusiveness, openness, and engaging attributes that can help to strengthen the media and its management. The official sources should remain valid and trustworthy so that the general public can have consistent access to the right information and updates, and have a clear understanding of the outbreak progression, its impacts and the guidelines to control and monitory measures. As an institution, media management should be effective to address these factors from the inception of the outbreak event. Failures to do so would shift the general public mindset to different directions. It could also create added confusion and anxiety, and could intensify the mistrust with the government. Hence, it is vital to avoid the inappropriateness of empowering the unofficial media, as they may have a higher chance of creating and disseminating false news and information. Thus, the role of media management should be effective enough to avoid unnecessary distributions caused by the public or even professional assumptions. Media management should rather focus on the provision and management of rightful sources of information that people can trust and follow meticulously. Adhering to such means of media management would help the society to play a part through health engagement, too.To summarise, media management should propose for certain media arrangements during an outbreak, those than can provide access to right resources of information, knowledge of urgent matters, incident response arrangements, information on possible restrictions, and relevant considerations for outbreak progression (Biosecurity Incident National Communication Network 2019). This dialogue of public communication would normally be widespread in the mass media (Watson 1993) , which in reality is consisted of multiple media means, including: digital media (of various examples), social media, unofficial media (e.g. forums, blogs), and official media (e.g. news and official dissemination). Mass media also operates at different scales of community-level, local level (district or city level), provincial/regional, national, and international. The media may also be framed and generated by different groups, such as local or federal officials, academics, medical experts, public health authorities, etc. (Kott and Limaye 2016) . In an outbreak event, all these sources play a part in the dissemination of information. While social media is appraised as a valuable tool from certain viewpoints, such as for supporting public health practices (Charles-Smith et al. 2015) , it is important to manage its validity and effectiveness through the practice of media management. Hence, there needs to be an integration between a particular professional sector and the social media, to ensure valid knowledge is transformed into the wider community. A similar example of social media use during Ebola outbreak was assessed by Hossain et al. (2016 Hossain et al. ( , p. 2136 , suggesting to have a formalized channel of communication as a necessity and to have public health responses as the priority:The West African 2014 Ebola outbreak has highlighted the need for a better information network. Hybrid information networks, an integration of both hierarchical and formalized command control-driven and community-based, or ad hoc emerging networks, could assist in improving public health responses. By filling the missing gaps with social media use, the public health response could be more proactive rather than reactive in responding to such an outbreak of global concern. Furthermore, as Tumpey et al. (2018) put it well, the evolving outbreak also comes with evolving communication. Hence, careful attention should be given to those widespread news/information broadcasting networks such as the digital media environment and those means of constant news dissemination (ibid; also see: Reynolds and Seeger 2014; World Health Organisation (WHO) 2018) . Therefore, it is important to involve the official public health authorities (Collinson et al. 2015) in the whole process: \""because the ways in which receipt of news is evolving, the ways in which public authorities communicate with the media and public needs to adapt in similar ways\"" (Tumpey et al. 2018, online source) . Such involvement should help to enhance the dissemination of important public health measurements (Collinson et al. 2015) , and avoid any disparities between multiple official sources. The media management should be effective enough to identify and avoid any unforeseen conflicts between multiple sectors or professional bodies, particularly through the public health system and their respective authorities. Any differences could impact risk perception, attitude, and subsequent behaviours (Kott and Limaye 2016) , which can be risky itself and can create unwanted tensions. Any misinterpretation could cause pressure on the authorities, hence it is important the communication is legible and inclusive to all. In this regard, the public perception of risk (Sandman 1989 ) and risk information (Kott and Limaye 2016) should be accurate, and communications should be conducted through the right channels. This should be processed through the development of a healthy communication planning (Covello 2002; Reynolds and Quinn Crouse 2008; Mitchell et al. 2016; WHO 2008; CDC 2018) . In line with such planning and arrangements, Singleton et al. (2000, p. 267 ) highlight a range of media management suggestions, including ten key recommendations that reflect on their experience of an outbreak: Four of these\u2026[recommendations]\u2026are around managing the media, including using a proactive press release, providing detailed briefings, using a single spokesperson and coordination of the response by a press officer experienced in media management. Another four describe how to deliver an appropriate on-site response, often requested during community intervention programmes. The two final recommendations relate to ensuring good communication and supporting staff during what is an intensely stressful period.The above should reflect on the details of communication planning. Therefore, we can argue that the reliability of information sources is extremely important for multiple stakeholders, multiple uses, and multiple levels. As it only takes one single ill-informed information to cause a chaotic situation with some added disruptions. In this regard, media management as a major institution, should be a constant supporting means during the outbreak progression. Finally, ignoring is not the right tool of communication, and media management should be taken seriously from inception. Media management should be done for the enhancement of reassurance, provision of guidelines and support, and information sharing with the right knowledge and updates to multiple stakeholders. While the information dissemination is important, its management is even more so."", ""Institutional Dimension-M5: Economic Management"": ""The correlation between epidemics and economics is widely studied (Bloom and Mahal 1997; Bloom et al. 2004; Bloom and Canning 2006; Beutels et al. 2009; CDC 2016; Fan et al. 2017) . Much of this correlation is studied in the field of 'Economic epidemiology', an intersection of epidemiology and economics. Yet, the overall economic assessment needs to be studied from the management perspective. Branched out of management sciences, economic management reflects on the functionality of economic operations, such as the management of resources, finances, income, expenditures, businesses, various enterprises, etc. Besides severe impacts on the society, mortality rates, and the health system, there are long term economic impacts from outbreak events; those that put production on halt, and impair the city's operations at most. Regarded as 'economic burden of disease', the World Health Organisation (WHO) (2009) identifies a range of measures that are oriented around productions (market and non-market), controls, and coping strategies through incorporation between multiple systems. Their report (ibid) focuses on disease and injuries at the micro level, while it can be understood and reflect on a higher level of a disease outbreak (Huber et al. 2018) , and how it may have economic consequences for the overall city management. This is related to both short-term and long-term impacts on cities and communities.The economic costs of outbreak events are generally significant (Thomson et al. 2003) , and the economic burden often comes in combination with 'social burden' or 'social costs' (Huber et al. 2018; Qiu et al. 2018) . Hence, the impacts can also be identified as socio-economic impacts (United Nations Economic Commission for Africa 2014). Similar to animal outbreak events, the \""general economic and financial instability\"" in a particular location is the result of weaker institutional structure (The World Organisation for Animal Health 2007, p. 112); hence, they become a bigger burden in the outbreak management during different terms. Similarly, in their report on 'The Economic Impact of the 2014 Ebola Epidemic', The World Bank Group (2014) assessed the economic impacts of the outbreak at short and medium terms, estimating the various channels of impacts on the society. In their report, they suggest two distinct channels of impacts, direct and indirect (ibid, p. 7):The impact of the Ebola epidemic on economic well-being operates through two distinct channels. First are the direct and indirect effects of the sickness and mortality themselves, which consume health care resources and subtract people either temporarily or permanently from the labor force. Second are the behavioral effects resulting from the fear of contagion, which in turn leads to a fear of association with others and reduces labor force participation, closes places of employment, disrupts transportation, motivates some governments to close land borders and restrict entry of citizens from afflicted countries, and motivates private decision-makers to disrupt trade, travel, and commerce by cancelling scheduled commercial flights and reduction in shipping and cargo service.In this regard, economic management needs to be considered at multiple levels, and it is beyond the boundaries of the city. It often takes into consideration certain national strategies, regional planning, and in more severe cases the attention of the global level. In the latter level, global trade may become disrupted (Amadeo 2020) and affected regions need to implement the emergency economic plan. While we do have an international mechanism of Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) to improve health emergency preparedness globally (GHSA 2017), its operations do not necessarily support the economic losses of specific locales. It is unfortunate that in some cases of an outbreak, the international cooperation (usually) responds with a delay; and the outbreak only becomes a matter of emergency once the economic impacts are felt at a larger scale (through development at epidemic and pandemic events). Throughout such a process, the city still needs to cope with its economic losses, financial burdens, social losses, and production reduction; and these require widespread economic management. In addition to these factors, the city needs to deal with external economic considerations (Awalime et al. 2017 ) and manage the economy at micro and macro levels (Luo 2013) , if not anything further. Some suggestions on economic management are associated to the implementation of a robust risk management framework (Santos et al. 2013; Cheshmehzangi 2020) , which can essentially inspect \""the tradeoffs between minimising sectoral inoperability and minimising economic loss\"" (Prager et al. 2017, p. 7) .To summarise, economic management should carefully consider issues of: reduction in trade and transportation, reduced tourism, reduced mobility, decreased agricultural production, decreased production activities, fewer investors, business temporary closures, market decline, high fiscal impact, higher unemployment, and redundancies (some extracted from lessons by Mercy Corps 2019). The city management ought to assess various costing and demands of multiple sectors (Luyten and Beautels 2009) , particularly those that are directly affected by the outbreak. A relevant cost analysis would help to decide on certain adjustments or priorities that can help the city's economic stability. From the institutional perspective, economic management should be conscious of slowing down the economy, assess the risks, and evaluate the long term economic impacts. There is an urgent need for emergency economic plans (i.e. through a multi-sectoral framework) to have an immediate action plan, short term contingency plan, and long term recovery plan. A multi-sectoral approach is essential (Smith et al. 2019) to evaluate co-benefits between various urban systems and have effective risk management beyond medical responses (World Economic Forum 2019, p. 13). Finally, economic management response strategies should be inclusive and should create an ecosystem of multiple businesses, sectors, and organisations."", ""Understanding the 'Provision' Indicator Category"": ""In this section, we elaborate on all target groups under the main indicator category of 'provision' and its two dimensions of services and supplies. Apart from the multimanagement requirements of urban resilience enhancement, the city needs to sustain the provision of certain services and supplies. In doing so, we respond to a situation of supply and demand, while dealing with potential shortages across various sectors. Thus, it is inevitable that the outbreak event results in the decline of services and a shortage of supplies. For services, there is a significant decline in regular operations of multiple units/sectors and their provisions, as we see mostly in weakening health care services and primary social services. We anticipate potential fragmentation in regular operations that impacts not only the growth but also the stability of the society. While emergency services are on full alert, the operation of other services may be significantly affected. Some services may have to reallocate their resources (including human resources), change their operations (i.e. towards reduction, interim halt, and provisional closure), and may be required to shift their capacity of service delivery in the time of need. Correspondingly, the most perceptible and common impacts on the provision of supplies are on medical supplies of various kinds (both related and unrelated to disease), anti-infective products, food supplies, and associated amenities that may cause major disruptions in the society. In the case of conflict zones/areas (and also those experiencing wars, sanctions, etc.), the impacts are generally more significant. For instance, the case of Venezuela (Lodeiro-Colatosti et al. 2018 , p. 1343 ) highlights: scarcity of basic resources largely affecting the public health infrastructure, resulting in long-term shortages of essential medicines and medical supplies, including vaccines for universal immunisation programs and the immunisation of specific risk groups against specific diseases.Hence, the already affected areas due to other structural factors such as conflicts, war, sanctions, economic crisis, or societal/political unrest, may face more severe impacts of the outbreak on the provision of their services and supplies. Therefore, it is harder to maintain the security of those communities as the impacts are expected to cause more adversities; and vulnerabilities are expected to be much higher. This factor also puts pressure on the effectiveness of the most pragmatic solutions or strategies. Thus, we can argue that the general impacts on those communities (as well as other cases of vulnerable cities or communities) become more perceptible in the control of the outbreak. Such vulnerability also triggers the event to have a more malicious progression, at a larger scale and a faster pace. In addition, the eventual impacts show a rapid sign of development on the supply chain, business enterprises, market, and their respective productions. Hence, we have to utilise both quantitative (Morgan 2019) and qualitative assessments of our services and supplies. The delivery of services and supplies, even in the most disruptive conditions, is meant to create a healthy continuity of daily activities. The patterns of such provisions will certainly be different from customary circumstances. More importantly, all provision target groups should include three fundamental considerations of: (1) risk assessment, (2) adaptive maintenance, and (3) prioritisation plan.Through 'risk assessment', we have to identify all risks and provide an immediate action plan. In general, the risk assessment needs to be quantitative and evidencebased (Athar et al. 2005; Guillier et al. 2013 ). Hence, a qualitative risk assessment (QRA), as proposed by Guillier et al (2013) , can enhance the understanding of the outbreak and its risks on services and supplies. Ultimately, this approach sheds light on possible deficiencies in provision target groups. In their disaster resilience assessment, UN's International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, UN/ISDR (2014, 2017) put cities as primary audience and suggest several risk assessment criteria in six distinct categories of:\u2022 Research-including evidence-based compilation and communication of threats, and needed responses; \u2022 Organisation-including policy, planning, coordination, and financing; \u2022 Infrastructure-including critical and social infrastructure and systems, and appropriate development; \u2022 Response capability-including information provision, and enhancing capacity; \u2022 Environment-including maintaining, and enhancing ecosystem services; and \u2022 Recovery-including triage, support services, and scenario planning.We can argue that such a criteria-based approach can enhance the possibility of a thorough assessment. Also, through its prediction modelling approach, QRA could develop possible scenarios across the provision target groups. Existing research suggests risk assessment for the applicability of evidence-based practice in public health (Forland et al. 2012) , which can improve the multi-sectoral assessment and their status, and can provide a reporting procedure to ensure better availability of necessary data (Cassady 2006) . In doing so, we may be able to have a better assessment in place in order to reduce potential burdens, as these are expected to be widespread and disruptive to all primary services and supplies. If needed, certain adjustments should be proposed to reduce vulnerabilities.Through 'adaptive maintenance', it is essential to increase the resilience of services and supply provisions. By responding directly to the changing environment and conditions, this factor includes both the modification plan and implementation plan for changes. In their study, Wilson et al. (2013) describe adaptive maintenance as 'resilience', which should not be confused with the transformative capacity of specific systems. In this regard, we may be able to provide a chance to \""deliberately transform systems and society\"" (ibid, p. 1) or deploy an array of supporting measures when it is required. The practicalities of doing so are mostly associated to monitory of changing situations, responding to each stage of progression, the flexibility of provisions in multiple scenarios, and modification of resources in between various sectors/units in our urban systems. Hence, in order to enhance the city's resilience, adaptive maintenance should create a systematic model of multiple sectors in a hierarchical network and ensure adaptability is prudently measured across each of them. This approach would enable us to maintain the flexible operation of necessary urban systems in the time of need.Lastly, through 'prioritisation plan', it is essential to identify what are the priorities in services and supplies? Where are potential deficiencies and how to address them? And when do we strengthen certain provisions? To answer these, and following from the utilisation of adaptive maintenance, a prioritisation plan would help to assess the needs of the urban systems. In a responsive approach, their needs should be carefully considered without negative impacts on other systems. The prioritisation plan can include a variety of factors, such as temporary arrangements, different spatial use, services support, economic support, supply increase, etc. In doing so, we can provide a holistic plan that encompasses multiple urban systems, and help to boost public investment programmes (if applicable), infrastructural support, financing (Cities Development Initiative for Asia (CDIA) 2010), as well as facilitating necessary strategy programmes to certain priorities, such as health care services, emergency medical services, etc. In the outbreak, the prioritisation plan ought to be reflective of the realities, and help to reduce vulnerabilities of those priority areas. This essentially helps decision-makers and enhances the aptitude of response strategy programmes.In the following five Subsects. 3.5.1-3.5.5, we explore all five individual provision target groups, across two dimensions of 'services' and 'supplies'. Similar to management target groups, we urge to consider the provision target groups both individually and collectively in integrative thinking. This is considered to be effective for the reduction of vulnerabilities and enhancement of provisions at the city level."", ""Services Dimension-P1: Transportation Services"": ""In cities, transportation services include a large body of transportation networks, and a wide range of public transportation systems (e.g. buses, underground/metro, monorail, trams, taxis, boats, etc.) , intra-city and inter-city transportation systems (e.g. airports, highways, motorways, ports, etc.) , shared transportation systems (e.g. shared cars, shared bikes, shared taxis, etc.), private transportation (not limited to private cars), emergency systems (like ambulance, fire services, police, etc.), and logistic system. Such services are also linked to transportation infrastructure (or physical infrastructure), such as roads, air transport, warehousing, water bodies, railways, etc. Hence, it is clear that transportation services operate for multiple purposes, for multiple groups of stakeholders/people, at multiple periods, and for multiple occasions. In the early phases of the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Chinese cities, Xu Yanhua, an official from the Ministry of Transport (MoT) had to intervene with an official announcement in support of the outbreak control progress. His statement was given as a reassurance to the general public, highlighting, in particular, the operational plans of transportation services: \""all-out efforts are being made to keep the transportation network and the green channels operational while curbing the spread of the virus through traffic control\"" (The State Council 2020). There is a two-fold from this statement, one that suggests the approved operations, and one that proposes extended control through traffic control measures.In addition, transportation services cover a large body of logistical support, those that are beyond internal productions and consumptions of the city and its residents. From emergency medical operations to food supply delivery, transportation services are comprised of many necessary factors that should be addressed during outbreak events. Many of our daily city operations are based on transportation services, and without them, the city may not be able to maintain the needs of its society, organsiations, and businesses. On one hand, they are essential to the city, and on the other hand, they play a major role in speeding the spread of disease (Lowe et al. 2014 ). The latter is evident in many cases as the transport process is recognised as a source of transmission, particularly \""if adequate hygiene measures are not implemented\"" (ibid, p. 872) . It is also proven that transportation is the first cause of disease spread and scaled up situations (i.e. of disease transmission); leading to eventual change of the event status, i.e. from outbreak to the epidemic, and from epidemic to potential pandemic. Hence, the ins and outs of city areas, city districts, and communities can easily boost the outbreak transmission across the city and beyond its boundaries.In most outbreak cases, there are limited measures that can be effectively implemented in time. Controlling and limiting transportation system services are difficult tasks for any city that should be driven by top-down decisions. The transportation system is extremely dynamic that we cannot predict how fast and in what direction the spread can take place. Similarly, as suggested by Rodrigue et al. (2020, Chap. 11) , \""transportation systems due to their speed and ubiquity act as a vector in the diffusion of pandemics\"", but they also need to continue with freight distributions. This means there is a likelihood of a great risk \""resides in the geographical and functional structure of supply chains because the continuity of freight distribution could be compromised\"" (ibid). Some of these factors are associated with the increasingly global economy and its pros and cons, particularly that many aspects of our contemporary life are now dependant on global supply chain networks. As Rodrigue et al. (ibid) suggest, \""even the slightest disruption in the availability of parts, finished goods, workers, electricity, water, and petroleum could bring many aspects of contemporary life to a halt\"".Moreover, the spread of disease through transportation is somewhat inevitable, as relevant control measures are often only applied at the later stages of outbreak progression. Therefore, our preparedness should rely on how the city can maintain the optimal operation of transportation services. An example of this is the utilisation of redundant transportation services to help with other provisions, such as the delivery of food and medical supply (into the city). While air transport becomes more restrict or reduce in operations, it is suggested to use those services for the provision of primary supplies. In more extreme cases, they can operate in a one-way system to ensure the city is not left without its primary supplies. Transportation, as a system is essential for multi-level operations, and as a service requires to support the demand of the society. Nevertheless, there are some challenges in regards to transportation services, such as, control measures for populated public transportation networks, density control plan, healthy ventilation systems of often enclosed spaces for public transports and their stations, provision of emergency transportation services, provision of safe transportation of infected and deceased people, closure of specific transportation networks, and reduction in general mobility across the city. Moreover, transportation services of all kinds may reduce in operation, meaning that adaptive measures should be taken into consideration to ensure certain transportation services are prioritised, some are maintained, and some are carefully controlled."", ""Services Dimension-P2: Safety and Security Services"": ""A crucial part of the services dimension is related to both the provision and operation of safety and security services. It is important to note that provision alone is not effective, similar to what we can identify as the non-operational institutional dimension of the city (Cheshmehzangi and Dawodu 2018) . The provision and operation of such services respond to the role of co-benefits resiliency actions (Siemens et al. 2013) , which are obligatory for decision-making procedures. The safety and security services are widespread, encompassing a range of imperative systems beyond just policy and security forces. Many safety services come under this particular target group, specifically focused on crucial factors of food safety, occupational safety, medical services, distribution system safety, logistics safety, emergency services, etc. Many security services include primary and secondary units/forces, such as security forces, police, fire services (fire detection, fire engine, etc.), bomb detection units, special forces dealing with various threats and emergencies, border offices (including immigration control), community security, communal guards, and military forces/army. Altogether, these factors shape the overarching factors of societal safety and human security, which are exceptionally important during outbreak events. By linking human security and public health, and by quoting John Donne's inspiring adage \""no man is an island\"", Curley and Thomas (2004, p. 30) argue that \""the human security concept offers one possible model that can equitably meet the analytic needs of the international community without devaluing or distorting its myriad elements\"". In this regard, it is important to maintain the safety and security of society, as it determines the overall safety and resilience of the city.Most studies associated with safety services of the outbreak are linked with food safety and how they should be maintained in healthy conditions (Jung et al. 2014) , particularly in agricultural businesses and food processing firms (Jin and Kim 2008) . This also requires to address any possible threats to food and nutrition security (Chen et al. 2020) . However, it is evident safety services are more than just food safety. Many safety measures should be in place through structured services (i.e. as per the above descriptions), and they should be up and running to maintain control and monitory of the city and its communities. Such services should directly respond to various societal needs, and deal with emergencies in the best possible way. Moreover, due to potential conflicts in communities as a result of increased anxiety and uncertainties, the safety and security of cities should be continuously sustained throughout the outbreak. Communities become more vulnerable under the shadow of fear and anxiety, and those in less affluent communities may suffer the most. In such occasions, many opportunists may consider taking advantage of the city's vulnerabilities; hence, careful attention is needed from those respective services to ensure reflecting on the society's gradual and sudden changes, and those that may potentially cause larger-scale disturbances. Also, another role of safety and security services is to monitor the compliance of the general public to regulations and rules that are in place. These should be conducted through regular and careful monitory procedures throughout specific phases of the outbreak progression.More importantly, it is vital to reduce the chances of chaos and monitor any unexpected situations. The end result of such chaotic situations would enhance the vulnerabilities, some that can potentially develop as societal disparities, unrest, looting, and potential societal downfall. Hence, many safety and security issues are dependent on society's compliance and their persistent support. Without such compliance, the outbreak can increase the chance of disorder, which ultimately increases the intensity of disruptions and vulnerabilities. Such a situation may turn some of the critical urban systems into dysfunctional units/services. Hence, precautionary measures are highly crucial. Moreover, the safety and security services, should reinforce the guidelines to ensure they are appropriately implemented through the right channels. In doing so, the effectiveness of those enforcements is essential. Such measures are assessed by Condon and Sinha (2010, p. 50) , as voluntary and mandatory public health measures:\u2026there was not a significant difference in compliance with mandatory and voluntary public health measures where the effect of the mandatory measures was diminished by insufficiently severe penalties, the lack of market forces to create compliance incentives and sufficient political influence to diminish enforcement. Voluntary compliance was diminished by lack of trust in the government.Hence, healthy community engagement is important to gain and cultivate community support; one that helps to nurture the micro-level safety of the communities in the city, if not the city-wide scale. In outbreak events, the priority is usually given to emergency services, and it remains so to ensure providing necessary support to specific emergency medical services. However, we still require to preserve the healthy operations of other services; particularly those that uphold the safety and security of our communities. Thus, a holistic understanding of multiple safety and security services would help to reduce their vulnerabilities and make necessary arrangements or adjustments in the time of need. Finally, it is important to strengthen the resilience of prioritised units and services through a hierarchical structure, which considers both the adaptive maintenance strategy and effective prioritisation plan. This approach should be practiced across multiple urban systems or sectors, to ensure all vulnerabilities are carefully assessed and addressed."", ""Services/Supplies Dimension-P3: Social Services"": ""A major provision aspect in outbreak events is social services, which is jointly shared between services and supplies dimensions of provision indicator category. In reality, social services are often neglected in early stages of outbreak events, but become significant players of the later recovery and post-recovery phases (more details provided in Chap. 4). Social services are widespread and include many important aspects of our cities and communities. For the case of an outbreak, a selective number of social services are very crucial and require supporting plans/strategies. Hence, the need to prioritise primary social services is essential for more effective outbreak control. In fact, social services deal with a wide range of services primarily accountable for providing, managing and evaluating social care and support services. They also include a range of public health services, health care, and safety services. In the latter category, only a few social services overlap with what has been already covered in safety and security services, such as police and fire services. Other relevant social services (and some applicable to outbreak events) are the provision of benefits and facilities that include education, food subsidies, health care, job training, subsidised housing, adoption, community management, policy research, and lobbying. For the case of an outbreak event, the priority social services are to ensure the right education is provided through appropriate means. This is a twofold matter, including the provision of relevant community training opportunities and supporting the city management in the development of education for medical services, emergency units, and health care systems (such as precautions.) This should effectively influence the density of awareness through the development of social-physical networks (Yi et al. 2019) , as well as through the right education.For food subsidies, relevant social services may not be able to cope with their regular subsidies as the adversities become widespread and embrace a much larger group of people. As a substitute, those relevant bodies can provide support to the city management units, to ensure the following three provisions are maintained: (1) price monitory of primary products, inclusive of food, sanitation, and anti-infection products, medical products (inclusive of protection products, such as masks and gloves), medicine, etc.; (2) ensuring vulnerable groups have accessibility to such provisions; and (3) securing external support for emergency needs and supplies. The other essential factors under social services that should be fully maintained are community management, through which relevant social services can empower the community leaders or community management units (if any); or otherwise, can provide the necessary support to disadvantaged groups and vulnerable communities.Above all, social services must play significant roles in the provision of health care, from both perspectives of services and supplies. This should reflect on issues of social protection and public health, a combination of effective measures that can be inclusive and supportive at the larger scale of the city. This provision could help to provide necessary precautions, specifically to those groups usually recognised with a higher risk of infection, such as health care workers (Cohen 2018) , elderly, and those groups that may have no access or limited access to health care systems. In specific cases, social services should address issues of social determinants of health, which in general are the \""complex, integrated and overlapping social structures and economic systems that are responsible for most health inequities\"" (Hepburn 2017) . Thus, social services as an activity designed to promote social wellbeing can provide health equity (Richardson et al. 2017 ) and the crucial health care provision, which are needed across all communities. Finally, it is important to note that not all social services can cope with the adversities of an outbreak. Some may need to temporarily stop their operations, and some may have to deal with a set of longer-term outbreak impacts. Therefore, it is recommended to seek external support (i.e. at the national and/or the international levels) in early stages. In doing so, we should make certain that the city's primary social services, particularly those that can help to overcome the societal vulnerabilities, are resourcefully maintained, strategically strengthened, and properly managed. As a major provision target group, social services are expected to provide multi-objective support to the society and the city's resilience."", ""Supplies Dimension-P4: Food Supply"": ""Apart from food safety, which is already covered under the previous target group, one of the main target groups under the supplies dimension is food supply. Undoubtedly, food is a primary consumable product, which can become a scarce product at certain stages of an outbreak event. The considerably large demand for food in cities is a major challenge for regular provisions of the city. This is particularly evident in the case of lockdown situations of communities and cities. In general, the main disruptions associated with food supply are associated with its 'production', 'distribution', and 'provision'. To date, there is little scholarly research regarding food supply during outbreak events, and the majority of existing literature only focus on food safety and not from the perspective of how it is supplied or distributed in affected areas.For food production, we see a major decline in or around cities, particularly in peri-urban areas and regional food production hubs. Due to temporary closure or non-operational status of many agricultural businesses, as highlighted by Jin and Kim (2008) , we see tangible reductions in food stocks, variety of food, and freshness of essential food or commonly known as 'fresh produce' (such as fruits, vegetables, (some types of) meat, etc.). Another factor associated with this conspicuous shortage is the common reaction of the society to uncertainties of the outbreak progression. This is caused by growing anxiety and the fear that the outbreak may last longer than initially anticipated. In most cases, people rush to shops and supermarkets and store as much food as they think it may be required. With limited impacts on fresh produce, we see a larger impact on other food products. This somewhat expected behaviour causes immediate food shortages. Hence, this inevitable reaction changes the equilibrium of supply and demand. On certain occasions, even if food production is only slightly reduced, we see a complete imbalance in what has been purchased and stored and what is remained on supermarket shelves. In this regard, the city may face sudden food shortages that cannot be recovered by partial operations of transportation systems. As we still lack wide-spread urban farming in our city environments, greater pressure would remain on food distribution; i.e. how do food supplies get to the city? How can they be distributed in time? And how regular can they be provided and distributed? Hence, ensuring smooth logistical operations are vital for the distribution of food supply, particularly of the regional agricultural and food supply chains (Chen et al. 2020) .In the recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in China (which was just epidemic for almost the first two months), the national-level Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Affairs (of the Chinese central government) released an emergency notice to all relevant and responsible departments to sustain order in markets, provision of supplies, and their delivery (ibid). In this specific event, the test for e-commerce, particularly for food and fresh produce delivery, was a success; highlighting in particular how food distribution can happen with minimised personal contact: \u2026as lockdown measures have led to a huge spike in demand for home delivery of fresh groceries, e-commerce companies have announced an in-app feature for contactless delivery, allowing the courier to leave an order in a convenient spot for the customer to pick up, without having to interact. Making use of these delivery platforms could address many logistical challenges for obtaining food, while minimising the potential risk of infection from visiting crowded markets to buy groceries (ibid, 2020, online source).The other suggestions by Chen et al. (2020) about issues related to the provision of food supply are concentrated on \""close monitory of food prices and market supervision\"", \""enabling policies for spring planting and increase support for production entities\"", \""smooth flow of trade and make full use of international markets as a vital tool to secure food supply and demand\"", \""protection of vulnerable groups and provision of employment services to (migrant) workers\"", and \""further regulatory measures on wild food markets to curb the source of the disease\"". Under provision matters, agricultural enterprises are often hit by the complexity of outbreak issues; hence, there is an urgent need for financial support to reduce potential risks of delays and production closures. Chen et al. (2020) even suggest for possible temporary subsidies that could reduce burdens on those specific primary productions, such as food production. At the epidemic level, the increase in the import of food supply can help to increase supply stocks. However, this should be done with extra care to avoid any unexpected spread of disease between different countries or regions. In particular, occasions when food supply may be the carrier of the disease, more measures need to be implemented to ensure scanning and full monitory of food import and export throughout the outbreak.Furthermore, it is evident that the shortage of food supply may turn into major socio-economic disruptions. The possible ripple effects on food prices and markets, as highlighted by Martin (2020) , is a major concern to issues of supply and demand in food production and its provision. With restricted logistical operations, food supply and associated businesses face significant losses; hence, extra support from multilevels of the government is essential. Similarly, Jung et al. (2014) argue the impacts of the food production chain from various aspects, as large as agricultural practices to widespread processing of certain food supplies. From their perspectives, there is scope for the development of science-based best practices to ensure food safety is maintained (ibid) before we can sustain the food and nutrition security of society. To summarise here, and in order to address issues of food supply, we have to consider the multiplicity of measures, practices, and provisions. Food supply remains a priority that requires careful attention, including both production processes and consumption demands."", ""Supplies Dimension-P5: Amenities Supply"": ""In addition to the primary target group of food supply, other supplies require attention and support during outbreak events. In this target group, we classify these other supplies into an overarching category of amenities supply, which in reality are in forms of supplies, facilities, and services; hence, altogether defined as amenities. These amenities are categorised under four groups of 'basic amenities', 'secondary amenities', 'mobile amenities', and 'virtual amenities'. Through these amenities (including also public amenities), we have to sustain the provision of certain facilities, services, and supplies that are crucial to the well-being (Dyakova et al. 2017) of our communities and cities. From the provision perspective, we have to prioritise the societal needs and conditional essentialities of the outbreak. In particular, basic amenities tend to be more effective in maintaining socio-economic values of society. Secondary amenities can be regarded as a non-priority group, while the other two groups of mobile and virtual amenities can be provided with a certain level of flexibility and through what Alterman (1988) refers to as 'adaptive planning'.Basic amenities are commonly recognised to be essential for the provision of societal well-being and quality of life (QoL). While the latter may be significantly affected during the outbreak, it is essential to sustain the former (i.e. societal wellbeing) through certain socio-economic benefits, facilities, and provisions. Some crucial examples of basic amenities are roads (particularly with access to highways and motorways), running water, energy (electricity and natural gas), telephone services (or connection networks/telecommunications), internet, as well as main public amenities, such as hospitals, clinics, medical facilities, pharmacies, sanitation units, waste collection services, and waste management units, general and specialised shops and markets, goods collection points, maintenance units, long-term care facilities (such as nursing homes and assisted living), and provision of clean environments. In this category, such amenities provide necessary values of societal well-being, those that are essential for smooth or partial operations of urban systems, multiple sectors, and communities. The city and its residents are dependent on such basic amenities, and such provisions are fundamental, with significant impacts both at the micro or individual level (such as individuals, households, and specific groups/sectors), and collective level of the city and its communities. There are also specific active facilities during an outbreak (from Interior Health website, online source 2020) that only operate in addition to those basic amenities, and are more specific to the disease treatment (including the provision of antibodies if applicable) or facilities that are temporarily needed during the event of an outbreak (or in certain emergencies).In addition, the secondary amenities are the provision of non-priority facilities, mostly comprehended as general public facilities, such as public places or communal areas, health centers/clubs, sports centers, restaurants and food courts, street food areas, community clubs, public toilets (or facilities of such kind), public baths, temples and religious centers, (urban) parks, leisure areas, libraries, cinemas, common public buildings (such as museums, galleries, malls, outlets, etc.), hairdressers and barbers, banks, post offices, recycling centers/units, connections to major transportation hubs (such as airports and ferry terminals), local bus and railways stations, training units, educational areas (inclusive of nurseries, schools, colleges, institutes, research centers, and universities), and other public areas for recreation. Certain businesses may also offer some amenities in this category, such as marketing, finance, etc. In this category, we deal with certain non-priority amenities, hence their provision during the outbreak is not advisory, or should be limited in main phases of the outbreak progression. In most cases, it is important to limit such amenities and their operations, particularly the ones that encourage populated use or gathering, multiple functionalities of the environment, closed environment activities, and non-essential public uses. Apart from these two categories, we also have mobile and virtual amenities that include certain facilities and provisions. For mobile amenities, they mainly include mobile facilities such as fuel services, oil change units, recycling facilities, food trucks, auto washing and detail service, retails sales of specific products, mobile repair trucks/units, mobile retail of any kind, and mobile health care services. For virtual amenities, we can refer to any of the above facilities that can be provided online or virtually, including in particular: retail (both buying and selling), selective educational means, training, and entertainment.To summarise, we refer to amenities as both priorities and non-priorities in the case of outbreak. As defined in their respective categories, certain amenities are more crucial for the societal well-being. It is also essential to effectively respond to context-specific matters, including-but not limited to-climatic conditions, availability of amenities, cultural and social factors of the society, behavioural attributes, institutional arrangements, and socio-economic structure of the city. To maintain the operations of basic amenities, as the least provision, we ought to ensure having an effective prioritisation plan in place or else the impacts would be widespread and may cause additional adversities to the society. As a matter of fact, these may potentially increase the vulnerabilities and reduce the values of essential socio-economic benefits to the societal well-being. Finally, to avoid any further adversities, the city should prepare comprehensively through strengthening resilience and an effective action plan."", ""Preparing an Action Plan and Supporting City Management Decision Making"": ""Through the conceptualisation of the urban resilience framework and its details, we verify tailor-made measures and practices for city preparedness during outbreak events. This conceptualisation is a novel approach in scholarly research, which benefits the process of preparing an action plan. Through the complexity of disease outbreaks that suggest their occurrence frequency, multiple types of infection, the intensity of the event, and various transmission mode, we can verify the need to understand such events from case by case and locale to locale; but more importantly, from the overall approach of 'preparedness'. Disease outbreaks are usually infectious and vary in their nature of transmissions, such as animal-to-person, person-to-person, from the environment, or other sources. They can create critical conditions, put cities and communities under disruptive threats, and impose high risk on our socioeconomic values and humanity. From their findings in comparing disease outbreak issues against natural disasters, Alwidyan et al. (2020) highlight the widespread lack of knowledge in outbreak events. Hence, we can argue that the combined effects of uncertainties (as highlighted before) and unawareness of how we should deal with the situation, make the society more vulnerable. It is worrying that in most cases, most people have very little knowledge of the situation of disease outbreak, pay very little attention to precautionary circumstances, and delay their responses in the face of mounting issues and adversities. We can argue that in all cases the society is not expected to be or cannot be fully prepared, but the city can. Thus, the city ought to prepare itself through comprehensive planning-or in other words, with a robust action plan.Our so far analysis indicates the obvious need for preparedness in multiple ways (e.g. with multiple sectors, dimensions, characteristics, actors, systems, and target groups) and by strengthening resilience in the practice of disease control and containment (summarised in Fig. 3.4) . In order to do so, we need to develop an action plan, which is comprehensive (Cheshmehzangi 2020) , quick (Ung 2020) , and effective. In reality, having effective responsiveness without an action plan is absurd, and having an action plan without preparedness and knowledge of the situation is even more so. Thus, the primary role of an urban resilience framework is to ensure it has the capacity to prepare the city either before the actual outbreak or with immediate effect at the beginning of the outbreak. This preparedness helps the city to develop an immediate action plan, which is reflective enough to the conditions of the outbreak. More specifically, we should aim to break prevailing boundaries between singular operations of the city, as they no longer can sustain their customaries or they may eventually fail to operate on their own. In this approach of integrated thinking, we could be in a much stronger position to support decision-making procedures at the city management level. Whatever procedure this may be, it should be all-inclusive and integrative in order to enrich the approach to embeddedness thinking (Thomson-Dyck et al. 2016) and comprehensive consideration of multiple sectors, multiple systems, and multiple stakeholders; and without having anyone or anything left behind. Fig. 3.4 The summary of four key dimensions of urban resilience and their relationships in their two indicator groups of management (above), and provision (below). The summary also includes specific essential factors for each indicator group, namely three factors of 'risk management', 'control & monitory management, and 'general management' for management indicator group; and three factors of 'risk assessment', 'adaptive maintenance', and 'prioritisation plan' for provision indicator group. Source The Author's Own Our discussions in Sects. 3.4 and 3.5 of this chapter are narrated from a comprehensive perspective, ensuring that all city-oriented aspects of management and provision are included and addressed. By proposing this comprehensive framework, we suggest a people-centric approach, addressing: how it is implemented as an instrument (or tool) to guide the city's preparedness plan, and how it can instantaneously strengthen the city's resilience during disruptive disease outbreaks. Unquestionably, we identify the important position of people. We also highlight the major need for comprehensive control measures and communication, including a healthy process of community engagement, which is \""increasingly recognised as a key component of outbreak response, allowing responders to engage the affected population and to alter behaviours which may propagate an outbreak\"" (Houlihan and Whitworth 2019, p. 142) . In this regard, cities and city authorities should be adaptive, reflective, and more importantly, they should be prepared and resilient. They should prepare to: (1) make effective adjustments, (2) enhance the institutional arrangements, (3) provide the necessary support, (4) reduce uncertainties and vulnerabilities of the society, and even (5) make new policies-even if all these have to be temporary. Just because relevant policies are absent from the national agenda or local plans, it does not mean new policies or adjustments cannot be made during emergency/crisis situations, such as in outbreak. If we neglect to make necessary adjustments, it indicates the lack of reflectiveness, and hence, we may neglect the actual meaning of having an action plan. Thus, our preparedness should lead to effective responsiveness at the time of need."", ""From Preparedness to Responsiveness: A Reflective Summary"": ""The effectiveness of urban resilience depends on the healthiness of urban systems. They need to be supported by strong institutional arrangements, and systematic preparations through adaptive planning and reflective progression. The outbreak investigation itself should be conducted promptly, reflecting specifically on how it is reported, how the quality of procedures are maintained, and how transparency is practiced (Kurup et al. 2019 ). In the process of preparedness, the city and its authorities need to adhere to precautionary guidelines and provide necessary updates throughout the outbreak. In a real situation, no official or authority would like to admit the risks of outbreak situations, all because of the impacts it may have on the city and the society. Nevertheless, to maintain the idea of bringing people back in practice (Thomson-Dyck et al. 2016) , we have to ensure any preparedness planning is a response to immediate socio-economic contexts. Therefore, in parallel to outbreak science (Houlihan and Whitworth 2019), we have to understand the complexity of city management and how it reflects on the societal well-being and the enhancement of urban systems. This requires resilience thinking, through which we can successfully progress from preparedness to responsiveness.On the other hand, many technological advances and instruments can be utilised to strengthen the city's resilience. There are new technologies for outbreak investigation (Srikantiah et al. 2005; Chester et al. 2011) , data-based notifications (Kahn and Kinsolving 2010) , new vaccine technologies (Rauch et al. 2018) , enhanced information and communication technologies (ICTs) (Tom-Aba et al. 2015) , informatics for detection (Zeng et al. 2005) , various spatio-temporal methods for detection (Jiang and Cooper 2010) , algorithms for detection (Buckeridge et al. 2005; Li et al. 2012) , automated surveillance (Cassa et al. 2006; Buckeridge 2007) , and many more methods and instrumental mechanisms that involve the use of data management, information systems, and digital platforms. As highlighted by Houlihan and Whitworth (2019, p. 142) , in comparison to previous events, \""outbreak response has made significant and impressive progress involving a wider range of disciplines, embracing modern technology, and recognising the importance of research during and in between outbreaks\"". Hence, we can argue in a positive perspective that disruption provides a chance for innovation; a chance for the trial of those innovative interventions, digital-based platforms, community enhancement, and multi-sectoral management. Moreover, such disruptive situations provide an opportunity to create synergies in management and operations, identify the city's weaknesses and deficiencies, and find means of resilience. It is almost like conducting a large scale SWOT analysis of the city's resilience, only that there is no analysis of such kind but strategic (and usually immediate) actions through preparedness, planning, and responsiveness.Finally, while in most cases we cannot simply stop a disease outbreak from happening, we have to ensure we are resilient enough against any possible adversity. In the first steps, we can increase the effectiveness of our detection procedures, enhance precautionary measures, data collection, observation measures, and prepare a reflective and feasible action plan. This preparedness can happen through resilience enhancement, and it should be comprehensive enough to include multiple aspects of our cities and communities. In doing so, we could boost the effectiveness of our responsiveness in disruptive disease outbreak events. There may be some losses and there may be some necessary adjustments or rearrangements. But above all, it is better to have a bit of loss at first than to deal with longer-term adversity.""}",Preparedness Through Urban Resilience,"This book explores the topic of resilience at the city level.

As reported by the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of people with diabetes has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 and will place diabetes as the seventh leading cause of death in 2030 [1] . Due to the chronic course of the disease combining with devastating complications, this disorder could easily cost medical care tens of billions of dollars. In a very recent report, the direct and indirect economic costs of diabetes in the United States of America in 2017 were as high as 327 billion dollars [2] . People with diabetes could easily carry a financial burden of about $13,700 per year [3] .Although the pathological mechanisms of diabetes appear to be closely associated with either a reduced production of insulin by the beta cells in the pancreas or the failures in transporting circulating glucose into the tissues via glucose receptors, the hyperglycemia and the subsequent complications involving the multiple organs and systems [4] could be managed by a modality of means including diet control, lifestyle modifications, and the effective therapeutic interventions including insulin administration [4, 5] . However, due to its insidious development, the early diagnosis of diabetes still remains as one of the major challenges medical providers are facing, and the satisfactory screening tools or methods are still required, especially a population-or community-based tool [6] .In the last decade, by constructing predictive models, an attempt to identify the factors that are potentially associated with the development of diabetes through data mining techniques has been made with some promising results in predicting or even capturing diabetes at its early stage [4, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Among these techniques, the decision tree technique was widely used in the medical field in making diagnostic approaches during clinical practice [4, 11, [13] [14] [15] . By creating a set of simple classification rules, this simple but sensitive decision tree approach offers its unique capability of establishing a prediction toward a disease by extracting meaningful information from a large dataset which is composed of many attributable factors [4, 14, 16] . Therefore, the objective of the present study was to employ a decision tree method as a support system by rapid and automated identification of individuals with potential diabetes."", ""Methods"": ""2.1. Study Population. Subjects whose age was \u226518 and who underwent the annual health check-up in the Department of Family Medicine of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from January 2017 to June 2017 were enrolled in this retrospective cross-sectional study. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The Ethics Committee of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University approved this study (reference number: 2017PS42K). By examining the medical record of each participant enrolled, a series of 9 variables pertinent to the health states that a patient could have at a given time point of his or her life were identified and used later for constructing a decision tree as reported in previous studies [8, 11, [17] [18] [19] [20] , and these variables are listed in Table 1 ."", ""Selection of Variables in the Study Design."": ""A series of nine input variables, which were widely used by the others in establishing diabetes prediction models [8, 11, [17] [18] [19] [20] , were obtained through either direct observations or laboratory tests of each participant. In detail, the demographic characteristics such as age and gender were analyzed for all the subjects; family history of diabetes was defined as any family member previously having been diagnosed with diabetes (Yes = 1, No = 0); history of cardiovascular disease or stroke was defined as one previously having been diagnosed as having coronary heart disease or stroke (Yes = 1, No = 0); physical activity referred to those that took at least more than 30 minutes of exercise for 3 days in a week (More = 1, Less = 0 ); work-related stress has three levels according to the participants' subjective impression (High = 2, Moderate = 1, Low = 0); and salty food preference was defined as a person who prefers salty food in daily life (Yes = 1, No = 0). Anthropometric information contain body mass index (BMI) and hypertension. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/m 2 ), and a B MI \u2265 25 was defined as overweight; hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure \u2265 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pr essure \u2265 90 mmHg and/or current use of antihypertensive drugs for blood pressure control. Diabetes diagnoses were made as either prediabetes or diabetes based on the fasting plasma glucose with a cut-off value of \u22655.6 mmol/L [8, 11] , and each medical report was then marked as either diabetes or nondiabetes accordingly."", ""Data Selection."": ""A total of 15,323 records were initially examined and analyzed for potential construction of a decision tree approach. In order to meet the strict criteria for building data mining algorithms, the dataset in which certain variables were missing cannot be used since the decision tree approach will not work with missing data points [21] . In doing so, 28.6% of the total data (4348 out of 15,323 records) failed to meet the criteria for data selection and was thus excluded accordingly. As a result, BMI (N = 1139, 26.0%), family history of diabetes (N = 313, 7.1%), history of cardiovascular disease or stroke (N = 1035, 23.6%), physical activity (N = 517, 11.8%), work-related stress (N = 618, 14.1%), salty food preference (N = 762, 17.4%), and with a past history of diabetes (N = 503, 3.3%) were discarded, respectively. With such a strict data filtration, the remaining 10,436 records from the eligible participants were used for further analysis in this study."", ""Classification Algorithm for Decision Tree Analysis."": ""The final database consisted of 10 variables which were divided into 9 input variables and one target variable. The target variable consists of two classes, the presence of diabetes or no diabetes. Classification of individuals as being at risk for diabetes or not was performed using the decision tree classifier J48 (C4.5 algorithm), a robust classifier which operates with numeric and nominal attributes and was implemented in WEKA 3.8.1 (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis, University of Waikato, New Zealand) [22] . With this technique, a tree was constructed to model the classification process based on the best informative attribute of the algorithm. At each iteration, the attribute was selected with the maximum gain ratio as the splitting attribute.Data mining methods often divide the dataset into two parts: a training dataset and a testing dataset. The prediction model is first constructed on the training dataset and then tested on the testing dataset [23] . Consistent with these methods, the final dataset, consisted of 10,436 records, was randomly categorized into two groups, the training and test groups. The training group comprised of 7305 cases (70% of the whole dataset). The remaining 3131 cases (30% of the whole dataset) were allocated as the test group for model validation.In the decision tree, the first variable (root) is the most important factor and variables far away from the root are the next important factors in classifying the data [4] . All the variables in one path are considered predictors (IF part), and the class label of the leaf node is the expected outcome (THEN part). To avoid overfitting and maintain parsimony, the model generated by the tree may be pruned by removing the nonessential terminal branches based on defined algorithms without affecting the classification accuracy [4, 24] ."", ""Model Evaluation."": ""We used a confusion matrix to determine the performance of the decision tree for diabetes. In this study \""diabetes\"" was defined as a positive event and \""nondiabetes\"" was defined as a negative event. The confusion matrix for two classes was used to extract true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.Using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0, a chi-square test was used to compare the categorical characteristics between the nondiabetes and diabetes groups. To measure the performance of the model, we used accuracy, precision, and recall. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) graph is a technique for visualizing, organizing, and selecting classifiers based on their performance. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the classifier can be described as the probability of the classifier to rank a randomly selected positive case higher than a randomly selected negative case."", ""Results"": ""In this study, the characteristics of the 10,436 records that were divided into two groups (diabetes and nondiabetes) are shown in Table 1 . Chi-square analysis revealed there was a significant difference between two groups as indicated in the table. We found that 1570 persons were diabetic and 8866 were not.A decision tree was built on the training dataset (N = 7305) while the testing dataset (N = 3131) was used to evaluate the model. By applying the J48 algorithm, a decision tree with 19 nodes and 20 leaves was built, and the results are illustrated in Figure 1 . The tree shows that age is the most discriminatory attribute, followed by BMI, family history of diabetes, work-related stress, physical activity, salty food preference, hypertension, gender, and history of cardiovascular disease or stroke. Table 2 lists all 19 IF-THEN rules created by the model.The model was further evaluated for its accuracy by applying a confusion matrix analysis on the testing dataset, and the result is shown in Table 3 . This prediction model had an accuracy of 94.2%; with such a high performance, 94.2% (2948 out of 3131 individuals) was correctly classified, whereas only 5.8% (183 out of 3131 individuals) was incorrectly classified. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the model was 94.8%, demonstrating that this model has achieved a higher accuracy in classifying the true positives rather than the false positives. Furthermore, the precision and recall values for the model were 94.0% and 94.2%, respectively, which were significantly balanced.The decision tree demonstrated that among those participants with age \u2264 49, 5497 participants (97%) of the individuals were identified as nondiabetic, while age > 49, 771 participants (50%) of the individuals were identified as nondiabetic.In the subgroup where people were 34 < age \u2264 49 and B MI \u2265 25, when with positive family history of diabetes, 89 (92%) out of 97 individuals were identified as diabetic, when without family history of diabetes, 576 (58%) of the individuals were identified as nondiabetic.Work-related stress was identified as being associated with diabetes. In individuals with 34 < age \u2264 49 and BMI \u2265 25 and without family history of diabetes, 22 (51%) of the individuals with high work-related stress were identified as nondiabetic while 349 (88%) of the individuals with low or moderate work-related stress were identified as not having diabetes ( Table 2 )."", ""Discussion"": ""By having factored nine variables pertinent to the prediction of the development of diabetes in a community-based setting into a sensitive decision tree model, we systemically analyzed a large dataset solely collected from a Chinese ethnic population. Our decision tree approach yielded a highly accurate (94.2%) model with balanced precision (94.0%) and recall (94.2%), respectively. Although all nine variables such as age, gender, BMI, hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease or stroke, family history of diabetes, physical activity, work-related stress, and salty food preference carried certain critical values in making an early and noninvasive prediction of diabetes before the expensive laboratory tests become necessary, age plays a dominant role on the potential development of diabetes by serving as a single but the most discriminatory attribute to diabetes. Secondary to age, BMI also stood out as another critical predictive attribute. With BMI being greater than 25, the subjects with age older than 34, younger than or equal to 49, and a positive family history of diabetes tend to have a higher incidence in developing diabetes. Under such a circumstance, BMI itself could be considered a key predictor. In contrast, the work-related stress appeared to be an important predictive factor for those with age younger than 49. Our findings were consistent with those previous results [11, 25, 26] . As suggested in our decision tree model, the participants with BMI < 25 and younger than 49 carry a low risk of having diabetes. Similarly, as shown in rules 1 and 13 (Table 2) , these subjects with BMI < 25 and active physical exercise tend to have a much less chance to develop diabetes. In addition to these findings, the work-related stress appeared to be another key risk factor as those aged people with a relatively higher BMI possess a relatively higher likelihood in their life to develop diabetes. Among several novel discoveries from our decision tree approach toward the prediction of diabetes in a community-based setting, combining multiple variables pertinent to the prediction of diabetes, medical care providers could take advantage of this simple but meaningful approach in their practice to identify those people who are at a high risk for diabetes [27] . It is thus that by screening candidates for potential diabetes, this decision tree approach becomes a powerful tool for the health care providers during their routine encounters with patients in a communitybased setting. No doubt, a successful identification of a person with an early diabetes could not only reduce the chance for the patient to develop a full-blown diabetes with severe complications but also significantly mitigate the direct and indirect costs incurred. Additionally, the key features presented in the tree structure could further facilitate diabetes prevention through community interventions, as individuals who are at a high risk of developing diabetes could quickly and easily be identified and targeted for a variety of education programs specifically designed for diabetes. Indeed, several large-scale trials have demonstrated the benefits of preventing diabetes with simple lifestyle interventions [8, 11, [28] [29] [30] [31] . Appropriately implemented preventive interventions in the early stage of the disease could render the progression of the disease to be less aggressive in its development as well as less expensive to both households with individuals with diabetes and the health care system. It is worth pointing out that such an approach can be extended to include other chronic disease managements in a community setting. Nevertheless, the present study could be improved if it could have been conducted in multiple sites. Indeed, a longitudinal approach with additional prospective data would better to explore the relationship among risk factors and other risk factors with distinctive predictive values. As a direction for the future study, prediction models with sensitivity and specificity higher than the ones reported in the present study should be sought in conjunction with data collected from multiple sites. In doing so, additional variables could be implemented in this model to establish a more comprehensive decision tree by which the holistic approach toward an individual with potential for developing diabetes could be precise and effective [32] ."", ""Conclusion"": ""We proposed a classifier, based on a decision tree, to identify potential incidents of diabetes from a database of annual health check-up reports in a large Chinese hospital. We used nine features of patients which are easily obtained and noninvasive as predictor variables. The classifier, trained by J48, indicates that a decision tree analysis can be successfully applied to screen diabetes, which will support clinical practitioners for rapid diabetes identification. This type of work is essential in regions where the epidemiologic risk is high and medical expenses are unaffordable for most of the population. In addition, the proposed model provides a means to target the prevention of diabetes through community interventions, which could help improve early diabetes diagnosis and reduce the burden on the health system.

Due to the chronic course of the disease combining with devastating complications, this disorder could easily carry a financial burden. The early diagnosis of diabetes remains as one of the major challenges medical providers are facing, and the satisfactory screening tools or methods are still required, especially a population- or community-based tool. METHODS: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study involving 15,323 subjects who underwent the annual check-up in the Department of Family Medicine of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from January 2017 to June 2017. With a strict data filtration, 10,436 records from the eligible participants were utilized to develop a prediction model using the J48 decision tree algorithm. Nine variables, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease or stroke, family history of diabetes, physical activity, work-related stress, and salty food preference, were considered. RESULTS: The accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value for identifying potential diabetes were 94.2%, 94.0%, 94.2%, and 94.8%, respectively. The structure of the decision tree shows that age is the most significant feature. The decision tree demonstrated that among those participants with age ≤ 49, 5497 participants (97%) of the individuals were identified as nondiabetic, while age > 49, 771 participants (50%) of the individuals were identified as nondiabetic. In the subgroup where people were 34 < age ≤ 49 and BMI ≥ 25, when with positive family history of diabetes, 89 (92%) out of 97 individuals were identified as diabetic and, when without family history of diabetes, 576 (58%) of the individuals were identified as nondiabetic. Work-related stress was identified as being associated with diabetes. In individuals with 34 < age ≤ 49 and BMI ≥ 25 and without family history of diabetes, 22 (51%) of the individuals with high work-related stress were identified as nondiabetic while 349 (88%) of the individuals with low or moderate work-related stress were identified as not having diabetes.

Identification of PDCoV in 30% of samples tested indicates that PDCoV is a common viral pathogen of pigs in the midwestern United States. We identified positive PD-CoV in 20 (22%) samples that were negative for TGEV, PEDV, RVA, RVB, and RVC, but PDCoV co-infections were more common (69 [78%] samples), especially with RVC (52 [58%]). Although the samples from Canada were negative for PDCoV, the Animal Health Laboratory has confirmed that 6 Ontario farms contain PDCoV. Because we selected samples on the basis of clinical diarrhea and geographic location was limited, the results do not accurately reflect the prevalence of PDCoV in North America. In addition, the presence of PDCoV RNA in feed does not indicate infectivity of the virus. The prevalence of PDCoV in North America is unknown, and the new PDCoV rRT-PCR can be used to access the prevalence in the United States and Canada.Phylogenetic analysis of the US PDCoV strains indicates a common ancestor with the China PDCoV strains.The China PDCoV strains are the only available sequences, and we cannot state that the US PDCoV strains originated in China. Because little is known about PDCoV, the US PDCoV parental strain may never be discovered. The NS6 phylogenetic tree branched differently from the other PDCoV gene segments; therefore, the NS6 accessory gene may evolve differently from the other gene segments. Complete genomes of PDCoV from other countries are needed to increase understanding of the origin, phylogenetic relationship, and evolution of the US PD-CoV strains.The date that PDCoV was introduced into the United States is unknown. Because the sequenced PDCoV samples were from a similar geographic location, the 99.9%-100% nt identity does not correlate with the possible genetic diversity within the United States. An alternate hypothesis would indicate that PDCoV has been an undiagnosed pathogen of pigs in the United States and, like RVB, has been circulating there for an extended period (6) or that PDCoV might be a secondary infection to other enteric pathogens. PDCoV pathogenesis and retrospective surveillance studies are needed to answer these epidemiologic questions in the United States and to determine PDCoV prevalence worldwide.In conclusion, a PDCoV rRT-PCR was designed to accurately detect PDCoV in a variety of samples. Complete genome analysis of the US PDCoV strains showed that they share 99.9%-100% nt identity and a common ancestor with the only available PDCoV sequences, the China PDCoV strains.The University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory provided funding for this study.

These studies were performed before the classification of HRV species as HRV-A and HRV-B was proposed in 2010 and before the later publication of the proposal for HRV-C in 2013 30, 31 . Furthermore, the presence of more than 100 genetically and serologically distinct HRVs and their roles in human illnesses remain unexplored. To provide a timely estimation of HRV circulation and to acquire the exact genetic characteristics of HRVs in China, researchers should continuously monitor HRV infection by using new classification methods.In the current study, the molecular epidemiology and clinical characteristics of HRV, particularly HRV-C, were investigated by a three-year surveillance study on children with ARD."", ""Methods"": ""The retrospective study was conducted at the Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University (CHCMU), Chongqing, China, as a part of a viral surveillance of ARD cases from June 2009 to June 2012. Chongqing is located in a subtropical region; CHCMU is the largest children's hospital in southeastern China and serves the population of Sichuan Province and two neighboring provinces. ARD was determined on the basis of an acute disease onset with symptoms of cough, rhinorrhea, dyspnea, and a fever of more than 37.5uC. Children aged , 14 years who were admitted in respiratory clinics for ARD were recruited in this study. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected and subjected to a laboratory analysis. Severe pneumonia was defined as pneumonia plus hypoxemia (at a constant SaO 2 , 92% in the air) or an increase in respiratory and pulse rates with clinical evidence of respiratory distress and exhaustion with or without an increase in PaCO 2 concentrations.RNA was extracted from each specimen by using QIAampH MinElute virus spin kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The cDNA was synthesized using a SuperScriptH III first-strand synthesis system for the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; Invitrogen, USA). HRV was detected by PCR, and the amplicons were further sequenced using the primers of 59-NTR sequences to classify the subtypes of HRV, as described previously 32 . The samples were also screened to determine the presence of the influenza virus (A, B, and C), metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (types 1-4), and coronaviruses (229E and OC43) by using molecular methods, as described previously 33 .The VP4/VP2 coding regions of the HRV-C-positive samples were further amplified and sequenced to identify the HRV type and genetic characteristics, as described in a previous study 31 . Primers targeting the VP4/VP2 coding region of HRV (forward, 59-GGGACCAACTACTTTGGGTGT CCGTGT-39; reverse, 59-CACGGACAC-CCAAAGTAGT-39) were used. PCR was performed at 95uC for 5 min followed by 40 cycles at 95uC for 30 s, at 60uC for 45 s, at 72uC for 45 s, and at 72uC for 10 min for a final extension.The genomic sequences were assembled using Lasergene's DNA SeqMan software (version 7.1.0, DNA Star Inc., Madison, WI, USA). Available partial HRV-C VP4/ VP2 coding region sequences were obtained from GenBank. The alignments were compared, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using a neighbor-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates (MEGA 5) . Similarities between the strains were calculated using BioEdit (version 7.13, www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit. html).A standardized questionnaire was designed to obtain the patients' information from medical records, including demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, symptoms and signs, laboratory tests, radiographic findings, sputum culture results, and the disease outcome. Consent was obtained from the guardians of the children. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Review Committee of CHCMU. The study was conducted in accordance with the approved guidelines.The variables were subjected to descriptive statistics: the continuous variables were summarized as the means and standard deviations or medians and ranges, and the categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and proportions. To determine the differences between groups, we performed chi-square tests, Fisher's exact tests, and non-parametric tests or ANOVAs whenever appropriate. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the associations between HRV subtypes and severe pneumonia. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using maximum-likelihood methods. A two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the HRV-positive patients are shown in Table 1 . The age and gender distributions were comparable between groups with single infections and coinfection. Cough, expectoration, and moist rales were the main clinical manifestations. The clinical manifestations of expectoration and diarrhea were significantly overrepresented in the patients with HRV coinfections than in the patients with HRV single infections (Table 1) . Severe pneumonia was identified in 31 (13.9%) HRV-infected patients; among these patients, nine exhibited single infections. A similar frequency was obtained in the patients with co-infection. Except for the higher frequencies of cough and moist rales in the patients with HRV-A and HRV-C, all the other clinical manifestations were evenly distributed among the three HRV genotype groups."", ""Results"": ""The occurrences of wheezing, asthma, and severe pneumonia were further analyzed using multivariate-logistic regression models. In general, HRV infection was significantly associated with wheezing (OR 5 1.37, 95% CI 5 1.02-1.84) and asthma attacks (OR 5 1.68, 95% CI 5 1.15-2.45) after considering the effects of age, sex, and the presence of other respiratory viruses. These associations were not observed in the patients with single HRV infections ( Table 2 ). The effects of the HRV subtypes on clinical outcomes revealed that HRV-A and HRV-C were more likely associated with asthma using the multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR 5 1.68, 95% CI 5 1.03-2.74 and OR 5 1.89, 95% CI 5 1.10-3.27, respectively). Additionally, HRV-C was associated with cough (OR 5 1.71, 95% CI 5 1.08-2.69). No effects on severe pneumonia were observed from either the single HRV or the co-infected HRV genotypes.The identified HRV-C was further characterized by constructing a phylogenetic tree using the sequences of the VP4/VP2 coding region from representative subtypes in GenBank. Based on the criteria of the HRV-C subtypes presented by Simmonds et al. 30 , the 89 HRV-C samples from the study were grouped into 32 HRV-C subtypes (Figure 1 ). HRV-C2 was the predominant subtype, followed by HRV-C43, HRV-C1, and HRV-C17 (Figure 2 ). Six HRV-Cs demonstrated less than 90% similarities with 51 HRV gene sequences available in GenBank (Table 3, detailed in Supplementary Table S1 ). Among these six, CQ4290 (maximum identity, 77.7%), CQ3144-CQ4245 (maximum identity, 83.5%), and CQ4260 (maximum identity, 84.5%) could be designated into novel genotypes and were temporarily named HRV-Cpat52, HRV-Cpat53, and HRV-Cpat54, respectively. Another two strains (CQ5641 and CQ2026) had homo-logies close to 90% and were accordingly classified as HRV-C2 and HRV-C16, respectively.Temporally, HRV occurred throughout the whole year and displayed a characteristic biennial outbreak pattern with alternating high and low peaks during the winter and spring seasons, respectively ( Figure 3 ). Independently, HRV-A showed comparable magnitudes of winter and spring peaks, whereas HRV-C demonstrated distinct peaks during the winter, spring, and early summer. Notably, the HRV-C peaks constantly appeared behind the HRV-A peaks at 1-2 month intervals, regardless of the year or season. The seasonal distribution of HRV-B could not be clearly defined because of the low number of positive detections."", ""Discussion"": ""In this study, HRV-A and HRV-C were identified as the predominant species present in pediatric patients in China for the most recent three years. HRV-C is genetically closer to HRV-A than to HRV-B. The three new lineages of HRV-C that were identified possibly indicate the rapid evolution of HRV-C in China. These findings further substantiate the necessity of continuous surveillance.In China, HRV was found to circulate among patients with ARDs by retrospective investigation. Jin et al. 29 reported a 13.1% HRV detection rate from 406 NPA samples collected from children in Lanzhou from 2006 to 2007, which consisted of 42% HRV-A, 23% HRV-B, and 36% HRV-C species. A study in Hong Kong, China, conducted in 2004-2005 revealed a significantly higher frequency of HRV (29.7%) in pediatric patients with ARDs with the HRV-genotype group composition comparable to the results of the current study (50.4% HRV-A, 41.4% HRV-C, and 8.2% HRV-B) 25 . The detection rate of HRV or its subtypes appears to be influenced by detection methods as well as by the spatial and temporal characteristics of detection in various studies.The seasonality of HRV circulation has been studied previously, with seasonal patterns varying geographically in different countries or regions. The highest HRV-C occurrences are observed during October in America 34 , fall and winter in Hong Kong, December and April in Gansu, China 29 , and between September and December in Spain 3 . In the current study, a biennial HRV outbreak pattern that occurred during the winter and spring seasons was identified. Chongqing is a subtropical region in China, and the identified seasonal pattern was largely similar to the pattern of influenza that has been identified in other subtropical regions in China (unpublished data). The high circulation pattern in the winter and spring may be explained by meteorological variables, such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation. Further study is warranted to investigate the relationship between meteorological parameters and HRV circulation in other regions. Different but interactive patterns of HRV-A and HRV-C circulation were identified. This temporal pattern of a high HRV-A peak followed by a low HRV-C peak could be attributed to the variation in magnitude of the susceptible popu- lation, which considerably diminished following a large outbreak of HRV-A, assuming that a cross protection exists among HRV genotypes. HRV-C causes significant febrile cough and asthmatic exacerbations in children, thereby requiring hospitalization. Previous studies have reported that HRV-C causes more severe clinical manifestations compared with the other HRV types 2, 18, 22 . However, in this current study, we only identified an association between HRV-C and an increased development of cough and asthma attacks; no correlation was observed with severe pneumonia. This discrepancy from previous studies could be attributed to the varied recruitment criteria for patients and the impact of a high frequency of co-infection. Considering that the patients in the current study were all hospitalized, they only represented a subset of HRV infections that were more severe than the average. This representation may have suppressed the association between HRV and severe diseases. Nevertheless, the significant associations in this study were inferred after excluding the effects of co-infection by multivariate logistic regression models. This approach presents an advantage over previous studies that lack multivariate analyses for the consideration of the effects from co-infection or other confounding factors 1,3 .Simmonds et al. 30 proposed 13% and 10% divergence thresholds on VP1 nucleotide sequences for type assignment and for identifying different HRV-C types using VP4/VP2. Subsequently, they proposed that the equivalent system for the assignment of new HRV types can be extended to HRV-A and HRV-B 31 . In the proposed criteria, the VP4/VP2 sequences are predictive of the HRV species and type, which can be used for type identifications in epidemiological studies. Results from previous studies suggest that most or all HRV-C types circulate freely worldwide, among which HRV-C2, C6, C16, and C43 have higher prevalences than other types 31 . VP4/VP2 sequences were used to study the genetic characteristics of HRV-C, and the HRV-C2 genotype was found to be predominant in Chongqing, China. Additionally, some new sequences divergent from the VP4/VP2 sequences were identified in mainland China. Although lacking the complete gene sequences, the available VP4/VP2 sequences logically support the classification of a novel HRV-C2 lineage, confirming the high genetic diversity of HRV-C in the region. Nonetheless, further characterization of the VP1 sequences is necessary for a comprehensive analysis of the novel HRV-C lineage.In summary, HRV-A and HRV-C were shown to be predominant in HRV infections, with HRV-C displaying a high genetic variation in Chongqing, China. HRV-C infection has been associated with asthma attacks and wheezing occurrence and, to a lesser extent, with severe pneumonia. This knowledge provides information for the prevention and control of HRV-associated ARDs. ""}","Molecular Epidemiology of Human Rhinovirus in Children with Acute Respiratory Diseases in Chongqing, China","Human rhinovirus-C (HRV-C) has been increasingly detected in patients with acute respiratory diseases (ARDs). Prolonged surveillance was performed on children with ARD to investigate the molecular epidemiology and clinical characteristics of HRV in Chongqing, China. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected from hospitalized children with ARD during 2009–2012. HRV-C was genotyped by sequencing the VP4/VP2 coding region. Among the 1,567 NPAs obtained, 223 (14.2%) were HRV positive, and 75.3% of these 223 NPAs were co-infected with other viruses. HRV-A (54.7%) and HRV-C (39.9%) accounted for the majority of HRV infections. Logistic regression models demonstrated significant associations between HRV-A, HRV-C, and asthma attacks, as well as between HRV-C and wheezing. A phylogenetic tree showed that HRV-C2 was the predominant type of HRV-C, followed by HRV-C43, HRV-C1, and HRV-C17. Three novel genotypes were proposed on the basis of a low identity with the known HRVs. Our results showed that HRV-A and HRV-C were the predominant types of HRV infection, and HRV-C showed a high genetic variation in Chongqing, China. HRV infection was associated with asthma attacks and wheezing; furthermore, HRV infections played a minor role in causing severe pneumonia. This knowledge provides information for the prevention and control of HRV associated with ARDs.",10.1038/srep06686,Medline; PMC,PMC4202208,25328042.0,cc-by-nc-nd,2014-10-20,Sci Rep,,,,1306489.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep06686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25328042/,2014.0,paper

This chapter focuses on these new pathogens and highlights their role in patients with hematological malignancies."", ""Human Metapneumovirus"": ""In 2001 the hMPV was described as the third known Paramyxovirinae to cause disease in humans, together with the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), all of which cause respiratory infections [204] . Infections with hMPV and RSV occur worldwide and are associated with a broad clinical spectrum ranging from mild to lifethreatening disease. Our group and others have shown that hMPV infections in hospitalized patients or in the elderly are at least as severe as RSV infections [125, 146, 147, 175, 178, 204-206, 218, 220, 221, 229] . Whether hMPV infections cause milder symptoms than RSV infections in otherwise healthy individuals has not yet been systematically investigated. Furthermore, hMPV and RSV often occur as copathogens and may then cross-react directly or indirectly [229] .Genetically, hMPV is most closely related to the avian metapneumovirus (APV) [204] and is assumed to have a zoonotic origin, a possibility supported by the fact that it can be transferred to APV-susceptible poultry. Serological and bioinformatic analyses indicate that passage to humans occurred more than 50 years ago [47, 48, 210] .In contrast to RSV, hMPV lacks two genes coding for the nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2, both of which are assumed to interact with the host's immune response. For this reason, RSV and hMPV may induce different host immune responses [25, 59, 122, 123, 144, 148, 191] . While RSV may be defined as a reemerging pathogen, at least in some patient cohorts where it was previously underestimated [174] , hMPV has been shown to cause a number of severe respiratory events in patients with hematological malignancies. RSV infection and hMPV infection are indistinguishable on clinical grounds alone [229] .In one study including 114 lung transplant recipients, hMPV was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from about 5% of symptomatic patients [45] . Further cases were described after lung and heart-lung transplantation in patients having histological findings of acute pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage and hyaline membrane formation [112, 192] . In hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients, hMPV can cause life-threatening disease. Englund and colleagues described a case series in which the hMPV detection rate by RT-PCR was about 26% among symptomatic patients, and 80% of hMPV-positive patients died from severe infection [63] . Furthermore, in stem-cell transplant recipients, viral shedding and persistence may be prolonged compared to otherwise healthy individuals and may be accompanied by severe infection characterized by rapidly progressive pneumonia with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [50, 63] . Until now, ribavirin has been the only antiviral agent used to treat severe hMPV infections [28, 85, 93, 165] . Ribavirin was tested in a mouse model and used successfully in two published clinical cases. To date, no other antivirals or vaccines are available."", ""Human Bocavirus"": ""Human bocavirus (HBoV) may be an emerging respiratory virus. It was first discovered in 2005 by the Swedish research group led by Tobias Allander at the Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm [9] . The discovery was made possible by a novel molecular virus screening technique involving DNase treatment, random amplification, cloning, and sequencing. The newly found virus showed up as a possible cause of respiratory disease, particularly acute respiratory tract infections. Clinical symptoms include coughing, fever, and rhinorrhea. It is still unclear whether HBoV is able to trigger disease on its own or occurs only as a copathogen [176] .Comparisons of the genomic sequence to other known viruses suggest that HBoV may belong to the Parvoviridae family, Parvovirinae subfamily, and Bocavirus genus. This genus has two other viruses, namely, bovine parvovirus (BPV) and canine minute virus (CnMV). HBoV may be the second Parvoviridae known to cause human disease, after parvovirus B19, which belongs to the Erythrovirus genus. Several nonpathogenic parvoviruses are also known to infect humans, including the adeno-associated viruses (AAV) of the parvovirus family, Dependovirus genus, and, in the same family, parvovirus 4 (PARV4), a possible member of the Hokovirus genus [113] . Two new viruses classified as HBoV2 and HBoV3 were discovered recently. HBoV2 has 75% similarity to HBoV, compared to only 18% for HBoV3 and HBoV2 [12, 100] . HBoV2 was detected in children with acute gastroenteritis in England, Pakistan, and Australia, whereas HBoV3 was detected during the course of an HBoV2 surveillance program but could not be associated to any symptoms [12] .HBoV is a non-enveloped single-stranded DNA virus, encapsulated in a simple icosahedral shell with a diameter of 20-26 nm, made up by the arrangement of two proteins. The main genome body containing the open reading frames (ORFs) encoding viral proteins has been sequenced and shown to be 5,309 nt in length [115] . The entire genome length is predicted to be about 6,000 nt [8, 9] . Experiments to directly sequence the virus genome failed and led to faulty data [9, 27] . HBoV is thought to have palindromic hairpin structures flanking the terminal ends, similar to related Parvoviridae (e.g., BPV and CnMV). The function of the terminal folds is not fully understood, but it is thought that they act as primers in viral replication and are important for packaging [101] . Until now, it was not possible to decipher the unknown sequences. Attempts to amplify the regions encoding specific enzymes did not reveal the nucleotide sequence [9] . An undetected protein covalent or other protein modification on the HBoV genome may explain this failure, as other parvoviruses (B19, MVM, and H1) possess protein covalents attached to their genomes [39, 51, 168] . Recent findings reveal that the majority (87.5%) of the ssDNA strands packed in the capsid are of negative polarity, independent from their viral subtypes [27] . The genomic composition is as yet unconfirmed, and so far three ORFs have been identified, similar to BPV and CnMV. One of these ORFs encodes for the viral capsid proteins VP1 and VP2, whereas the other two encode for non-structural proteins. The VP2 gene sequence is nested within the VP1 gene sequence. The VP1 sequence, compared to VP2, contains a unique terminal sequence, VP1u [163] , which may be required for HBoV genome transfer to the nucleus for replication [236] . The HBoV capsid is composed of 60 proteins, derived from the structural molecule VP1 and its derivative VP2 [9] . The functions of the non-structural proteins NS1 and NP-1 are still equivocal. NS1 may play a role in replication. It generally acts as an initiator protein (for parvoviruses), specifically controlling the process by which several concatemeric intermediates are processed by rolling-hairpin replication [15] . The role for NP-1, located in the middle ORF, is still unclear, but probably also involves parvovirus replication. The transmission route of HBoV is still unknown, but suggested tissue sites for replication are the respiratory and intestinal epithelia, as well as the lymphatic organs. Parvoviruses replicate only in proliferating cells, and the viral proteins are transcribed only during the S-phase. Recently, an in vitro replication system for HBoV using stratified human airway epithelium to imitate the human trachea was successfully established.The cells were inoculated with HBoV-positive material from respiratory tract secretions of hospitalized children. Apical HBoV release from the cells was confirmed using PCR. This study further showed that the transcription model resembled that of both of the other known bocaviruses (BPV and MVC) [52] .Symptoms associated with possible HBoV infection are wheezing, fever, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia [8, 12, 19, 31, 33, 41, 43, 44, 49, 97, 114, 118-121, 124, 126, 141, 176, 177, 179, 183, 195, 198, 203, 213, 219, 226, 235, 237, 239] . However, the presence of HBoV in the respiratory tract does not prove that the virus is the cause of infection. HBoV is often detected concomitantly with other respiratory viruses [41, 216, 226] , a fact that adds to the uncertainty regarding the pathogenic potential for HBoV [41, 66, 91, 97, 118, 124, 128, 136, 176, 200, 203, 213, 217, 226, 239] . The symptoms are identical in patients positive for HBoV alone or combined with another virus, but the viral load is higher in mono-infections than in coinfections. Asymptomatic patients can carry the virus. In one study, 43% of tested asymptomatic children were HBoV-positive. These patients were admitted for elective surgery, and the group undergoing mainly ear, nose, and throat surgery had the highest prevalence of asymptomatic HBoV infection [124] . These data suggested that HBoV may persist in the host in the tonsillar lymphoid tissue, contributing to tonsillar hyperplasia [126] . HBoV has been detected in patients with symptoms of gastrointestinal infection, but it is unclear whether the virus is only excreted in stool or is a cause of gastroenteritis. In these studies, HBoV was found concomitantly with a norovirus or other enteric viruses, and HBoV was not directly proven to be a cause of gastrointestinal infection. The virus in suspension in respiratory secretions may be simply swallowed and excreted in stool. The newly discovered HBoV2 and HBoV3 have both been detected in stool samples. HBoV2 was identified in a study involving stool sample screening in children with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis [12, 100, 179] , and HBoV2 and HBoV3 were detected in hospitalized children with acute gastroenteritis. More studies on the two new HBoV types are needed to gain a better understanding of their role in gastrointestinal infections. No evidence that HBoV2 and HBoV3 can infect gastrointestinal tissue exists to date. Furthermore, whether detection of these viruses in serum indicates viremia or infection of blood cells is unknown, because there are no currently established methods for detecting HBoV particles. The related parvovirus B19 can infect erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow, but no HBoV DNA was detected in bone marrow samples from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive and -negative individuals, whereas B19 was present in both groups [76, 146] . So far, there is one published report of HBoV associated with severe pneumonia in a pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient [172, 173] and one of HBoV infection in an adult with leukemia [109] . However, none of these patients had clinical symptoms different from those caused by other \""common cold\"" pathogens, and no specific antiviral therapy was available.Since the discovery of HBoV, infections with this virus have been found worldwide. The prevalence of infections in which HBoV may be a causative factor ranges from 1.5% to 19.3%. No seasonal variations have been described. HoBV occurs mainly in pediatric patients aged 6-24 months [4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17, 37, 40, 42, 44, 61, 74, 77, 86, 91, 95, 99, 103, 116, 127, 132, 143, 149, 158, 160, 162, 166, 167, 179, 187, 189, 194, 214, 219, 226, 235, 238] . Younger children may be protected by maternal antibodies [38] . HBoV-IgG can cross the placental barrier, but it is unclear whether HBoV can be transmitted from the mother to her fetus. Antibodies against HBoV have been found in about 94% of individuals older than 19 years of age [44] . At the moment, only two different genotypes of the single HBoV lineage are known. A simple verification test is available for rapidly differentiating between these two genotypes. Digestion of a 309-bp fragment of the VP1/VP2 gene with BstAPI endonuclease yields two fragments with genotype 1, but induces no cleavage with genotype 2 [54]. Three HBoV2 genotypes have been identified [5] , but no information is available for HBoV3.Despite a large number of clinical studies, the biological background of HBoV is still unknown. The virus can be replicated in a cell line. However, complete genome sequencing is needed to fully understand the virus. As this virus may cause acute respiratory disease, it is crucial to understand the disease process and its causative agent."", ""Human Coronaviruses"": ""As of August 2009, five human coronaviruses (CoVs) were known, of which three meet the definition of emerging pathogens. The five human CoVs are OC43 and 229E, two long-known viruses that cause respiratory and/or gastrointestinal disease, and the emerging viruses SARS-CoV [56], NL63 [207] , and HKU-1 [233] . SARS-CoV appears to be an archetypical zoonosis responsible for a single outbreak, which was unfortunately accompanied with high mortality and had the potential for a pandemic event. The two other newly detected CoVs, NL63 and HKU-1, occur periodically and infect all age groups worldwide.After the identification in the 1960s of the first CoVs known to cause human disease, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, and their association with mild respiratory disease [30, 34, 67, 84, 137, 142] , little new information emerged in this field until the beginning of the twenty-first century. In 2002/2003, a CoV appeared in the Guangdong province of China, causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [56, 108, 156] . SARS was fatal in some patients, although at the time CoVs were believed to cause only mild disease. Strenuous efforts were made to identify and to characterize this new virus and to curb its potential for causing a pandemic.Among the heterogeneous Coronaviridae family, CoV NL63 (HCoV-NL63) was identified in 2004 [207] and CoV HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) in 2005 [232] . In contrast to SARS-CoV, these newly detected CoV led to clinical symptoms similar to those caused by HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. Considerable research has been undertaken to learn more about these viruses, their differences, similarities, and characteristics. This review focuses mainly on SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63.Several techniques were employed to characterize and to identify the agent causing SARS. Tests for known respiratory viruses were negative. Patient samples were inoculated onto Rhesus monkey kidney cells (fRhk4) to look for cytopathic effects. Electron microscopy revealed the morphology of the virus and led to characterization of the virus family. Histopathological studies showed mild interstitial inflammation with scattered alveolar pneumocytes. In an immunofluorescence antibody assay, sera from patients had high titers of antibodies against the infected cells. A random RT-PCR assay generated DNA fragments of unknown origin, but with homology to viruses of the Coronaviridae family, and confirmed the results of electron microscopy. A few days later, these results were confirmed by two other groups [56, 108, 156] . SARS and its causative agent appeared unexpectedly and spread explosively. The infection was transmitted from palm civets to humans, although it has since been confirmed that bats are the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV. Due to the fast mutation rate of RNA viruses and their resulting genotypic markers, the course of the infection could be reconstituted in great detail. In the early phase of the SARS near pandemic, the very first index patient fulfilling the subsequent WHO definition of SARS resided in Foshan near Guangzhou and was identified on November 16, 2002. One month later, the second case occurred, in Shenzhen, where a man who had regular contact with wild animals was infected and transmitted the disease to his family and to several staff members at the hospital where he was admitted. Similar cases were reported nearby. In January 2003, the second phase of the SARS outbreak started in Guangzhou. Several patients died, and patients were transferred to major hospitals, leading to nosocomial spread of the virus to other patients and health-care workers.The next and final phase started in mid-February 2003 and heralded the pandemic. A doctor was infected in Guangdong province and took the disease to Hong Kong, where he stayed in a hotel (\""hotel M\""). He infected 17 other people, who were admitted to different hospitals, where further nosocomial infections occurred. Some of the infected patients transferred the virus via air travel to Vietnam, Singapore, and Toronto, where new cases emerged. A novel CoV was identified on March 21, 2003, and confirmed a few days later. The first strain (Tor2) was fully sequenced on April 12, 2003 , and SARS-CoV was proven to be the cause of SARS [134]. In July 2003, the epidemic ended, with no further human-to-human transmissions being reported. In September 2003, a new case was reported at a laboratory in Singapore, and over the next 2 years other accidents occurred in laboratories.HCoV-NL63 was discovered in a 7-month-old child with bronchiolitis. Diagnostic tests for all known respiratory viruses were negative. Inoculation of a sample on tMK and, later on, LLC-MK2 cell cultures produced a cytopathic effect. In the LLC-MK2 cell culture supernatant, a new virus was identified using the VIDISCA method [161, 207] . Sequence comparisons established that the virus was most closely related to HCoV-229E and, together with PEDV and Bat-CoV, belonged to the coronavirus subgroup 1b. Two further research groups obtained identical results soon afterward [65, 72].There is some indication in the literature that HCoV-NL63 was detected much earlier. Viruses were described that did not exhibit all the characteristics of HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43. Unfortunately, these isolates were lost, so that studies could not be done to determine whether one or more of them were identical to HCoV-NL63. SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 are both members of the Coronavirus genus, Coronaviridae family, within the Nidovirales order. Both organisms are positive single-stranded RNA viruses with a large genome of about 30 kb. The virus particles are enveloped and possess peculiar spike-shaped proteins on their surface that produce a crown-like appearance. Electron microscopy revealed particles of 80-140 nm located either within the infected cells at the rough endoplasmic reticulum in double-membraned vesicles or outside the cells attached to the plasma membrane.The genomes of both SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 can be roughly divided into two parts. The 5\u00a2 twothirds consists of one large polyprotein (ORF1ab) including several domains with autocatalytic activities, producing nonstructural proteins (NSPs) involved in replication and immune evasion. ORF1ab encodes 16 NSPs in toto in both SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63.The last third at the 3\u00a2 end of the genome contains the ORFs coding for the functional proteins -spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) -and for accessory protein genes that vary in number and position across species.Traditionally, CoVs were classified -due to their antigenic cross-reactivity -into three groups, which were largely confirmed later on by sequence analysis results. Group I and II viruses infect mammals, whereas group III viruses infect only birds. While HCoV-NL63 belongs to group 1b, SARS-CoV and the bat CoVs are considered group 2b viruses, although bat CoVs constitute a newly identified CoV group.HCoV-NL63 is most closely related to HCoV-229E, and phylogenetic analysis findings suggest that HCoV-NL63 may have diverged from HCoV229E in the twenty-first century. Furthermore, there seem to be two main genetic clusters of HCoV-NL63, and there is evidence that the HCoV-NL63 genome is arranged in a mosaic-like manner.Patients infected with HCoV-NL63 usually experience only mild symptoms, including cough, rhinitis, rhinorrhea, and pharyngitis, often with a fever. In rare cases, pneumonia can occur, chiefly in children aged 0-3 years, older people, and immunocompromised individuals. Among children with severe lower respiratory tract infection, a substantial number have croup compared to a control group. Croup or laryngotracheobronchitis is characterized by a loud barking cough, inspiratory stridor, and hoarseness. An association with Kawasaki disease has been postulated but not confirmed despite studies by a number of research groups [11, 14, 15, 53, 58, 87, 106, 111, 140, 188, 190, 193, 202, 208] .After the detection of HCoV-NL63 in The Netherlands and, later on, in New Haven, CT, USA, this virus was found in a number of countries, suggesting a worldwide distribution. Except in subtropical regions, HCoV-NL63 was mainly detected in the winter months and often turned up with other co-pathogens, such as influenza, RSV, parainfluenza, and hMPV. The HCoV-NL63 load is attenuated when there is another pathogen. However, and not surprisingly, the infection itself seems more severe in co-infections. As with SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 is detectable up to 2 months after recovery from the disease. Seroprevalence studies showed that virtually every adult encounters HCoV-NL63 at least once in a lifetime. Antibodies specific for the S protein are produced and display a neutralizing effect.People infected with SARS-CoV had a fever, chills, myalgia, rigor, and a nonproductive cough. Clinical symptoms such as rhinorrhea and sore throat were less common. In contrast to HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV did not infect children, and the disease occurred instead in normal and healthy adults and in the elderly. Of 8,096 infected people, 774 died, demonstrating a nearly 10% mortality rate. SARS-CoV spread to more than 30 countries [26, 29, 35, 94, 186, 227] . The first outbreak occurred in late 2002/early 2003. Seasonality of HCoV-NL63 infection is not known, as the pandemic occurred only once, with the peak in winter. It has been confirmed that SARS-CoV is a zoonosis that originates primarily from bats. Although SARS-CoV was initially spread from civets to humans, the actual transmission route was from humans to humans, most likely by droplets, and probably occurred in health-care facilities, at workplaces, and when using public transportation. The virus was detected not only in the respiratory tract, but also in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, brain, and other tissues.Seroprevalence was quite low among the general population, ranging across studies from 0% to 1.81% and being slightly higher in asymptomatic health-care workers. In contrast, a much higher rate (up to 40%) was found in asymptomatic animal handlers, which was not surprising, as these individuals probably acquired immunity via less pathogenic SARS-CoVlike strains that also emerged by zoonotic recombinations. SARS-CoV infection can be accompanied by co-pathogens such as other respiratory viruses (e.g., hMPV) or other CoVs.The association of SARS-CoV with severe pneumonia in patients with hematological malignancies occurred only during the single outbreak, and studies on the role for NL63 in these high-risk patients are still limited. However, 229E has been detected in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with high fever, cough, and interstitial and alveolar lung disease [157] ."", ""Polyomaviruses"": ""Recently, two novel polyomaviruses were detected in respiratory aspirates. Allander et al. in Sweden discovered a previously unrecognized third human polyomavirus in 6 (1%) of 637 nasopharyngeal aspirates and 1 (0.5%) of 192 fecal samples, and suggested the name KI polyomavirus (KIPyV) [7] . The second newly identified polyomavirus was found by Gaynor et al. in respiratory samples from Bribane, Australia, and St. Louis, MO, USA. This \""Washington University\"" (WU) genome polyomavirus (WUPyV) was amplified and cloned from the nasopharyngeal aspirate of a 3-yearold patient with pneumonia and negative tests for other respiratory viruses. Screening of 2,135 patients with respiratory tract infections identified 43 additional cases [79] . Of note, KIPyV was not named for the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm where it was detected. Since the first description of KIPyV and WUPyV, a number of prevalence studies from various areas have been published, but the association of these viruses with acute respiratory tract infections remains unclear [2, 13, 117] .Prevalence studies of KIPyV and WUPyV showed a worldwide distribution. The prevalence of KIPyV was 1% in Sweden, 1.4% in the United Kingdom, 1.99% in Thailand, and 2.6% in Australia [7, 23, 152, 155] . The prevalence of WUPyV was higher, 7% in South Korea, and 6.29% in Thailand [88, 155] . Australia, the USA, and the UK had WUPyV prevalences of 4.5%, 1.2%, and 1.0%, respectively [23, 79, 152] . The age distribution of KIPyV-and WUPyV-infected patients showed two peaks, in patients younger than 15 years (with the highest rates occurring before 5 years of age) and older than 45 years [3, 150] . Seasonal variations in KIPyV and WUPyV did not appear consistently. KIPyV infections predominated during the winter months in Thailand but not in Australia. In contrast, WUPyV infections were predominantly detected during late winter, peaking in December to early summer in Australia but not in Thailand [23, 24, 155] .KIPyV and WUPyV are frequently associated with other respiratory viruses. High co-detection rates were found in Australia, 74.7% for KIPyV and 79.7% for WUPyV, and the most commonly co-detected viruses were human rhinovirus and HBoV. Co-detection of KIPyV and WUPyV was found in 14 patients, of whom only 1 had no other respiratory virus [23]. Norja et al. detected KIPyV or WUPyV in 19 patients and found a viral coinfection rate of nearly 50% with predominant detection of adenoviruses. The overall frequencies of KIPyV and WUPyV detection were similar in patients with upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection, or no respiratory symptoms, and eight patients were immunosuppressed, although overall the patient groups were not very well described [152] .Data are not available to determine whether KIPyV and WUPyV detection represents a similar phenomenon to JCV and BKV reactivation in immunocompromised patients, or whether KIPyV and WUPyV share the oncogenic potential of other human and animal polyomaviruses, and further studies are needed [242] . However, Koch's modified postulates have not been verified so far, and whether KIPyV and WUPyV are respiratory pathogens or innocent bystanders is still debated. Further studies are required to evaluate the clinical relevance of KIPyV and WUPyV detection in respiratory specimens.Another newly recognized polyoma virus of interest may be the Merkel cell polyoma virus, MCPyV, recently identified in Merkel cell carcinoma. MCPyV may have oncogenic potential, as it is found mainly in lesional and non-lesional skin from patients with Merkel cell carcinoma and other skin diseases [73] . This oncogenic potential, as well as experience with other oncogenic viruses such as EBV, suggests a high likelihood of MCPyV generating clinical events in patients with hematological malignancies. However, until now, there are more questions than answers regarding this new virus. The role for MCPyV in disease is unclear, and cell-culture and animal models are not yet available [169] ."", ""Picornaviruses"": ""Within the group of picornaviruses, two emerging virus lines were identified recently, namely, rhinovirus X associated with severe respiratory disease and the parechoviruses. The newly identified rhinovirus [105, 129, 171] causes common colds that can progress to fatal infections in high-risk patients. The role for this virus in patients with hematological malignancies is unclear. The number of known parechoviruses is growing rapidly, as novel identification methods have led to the discovery of new variants. Parechoviruses were classified in the Enterovirus genus initially, then found to exhibit different biological features, leading to their reclassification in their own genus. Clinically, they cause the same spectrum of disease as enteroviruses. The rodent parechovirus known as Ljungan virus is believed to be associated with greater disease severity [1, 6, 20-22, 55, 68, 90, 96, 107, 151, 170, 199, 209, 212, 223, 230, 231, 234, 240, 241] . As with enteroviruses, parechoviruses deserve careful attention in highrisk patients."", ""Respiratory Syncytial Virus"": ""The RSV has been known for decades and is not believed to be an emerging pathogen. However, recent investigations have demonstrated clearly that RSV infection is underestimated in the elderly and in patients with other malignancies, where it may cause severe to fatal pneumonia [174, 182, 184, 185, 196, 197, 215, 222] . This increasing incidence in some patient groups may define the RSV as a reemerging pathogen, although it is ascribable to the use, for the first time, of molecular RSV diagnostic methods in vulnerable patient groups. In all likelihood, the RSV was present in these groups previously but went unrecognized.RSV accounts for a large number of infections throughout the treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In one study, about 57% of patients were positive for RSV at some point in time [102] . RSV is also of clinical significance following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and has been found in a substantial proportion of patients with lung infections [64, 133]. Furthermore, RSV was responsible for 55% of fatal pneumonia cases in adult immunocompromised patients treated for lymphoma and leukemia in a retrospective study and was a major cause of viral pneumonia in several cohorts of patients with these hematological malignancies [57, 78, 81, 82, 164, 201, 228] .In patients with hematological malignancies, and most notably in hematopoietic stem cell recipients, RSV infection is fatal in up to 80% of cases [89] . In these patients, ribavirin, immunoglobulins, and the RSV-specific humanized monoclonal antibody palivizumab may be used as specific therapy and/or prophylaxis [18, 32, 36, 38, 60, 69, 70, 75, 80, 83, 104, 110, 138, 139, 145, 159, 181, 211, 224, 225] . However, evidence supporting the use of these treatments remains weak at this time."", ""Parainfluenza Viruses"": ""Clinically, parainfluenza viruses 1-4 cannot be differentiated from RSV or hMPV infection. As they infect the same groups of patients and cause identical symptoms, they require the same attention as other pathogens. They can also be classified among reemerging viruses, as screening was recently introduced. Parainfluenza viruses should be considered in the differential diagnosis of respiratory infection and distinguished from emerging pathogens [98, 154]."", ""Influenza Viruses"": ""Influenza viruses are not emerging viruses, as in theory all potential variants and reassortants are identified based on well-known data on the mode of replication and influenza-associated biological phenomena such as antigen shift. Nevertheless, perhaps due to concern that a lethal variant similar to the Spanish flu may return, or due to the awarding of research grants based on this fear, any \""novel\"" influenza virus variant is estimated to have pandemic potential and is therefore classified as an emerging pathogen (and as an opportunity for the media to generate widespread fear of general social disorganization and massive mortality). The most recent virus classified as an emerging influenza virus was the Mexican H1N1 strain identified in 2009.Recent developments in the swine-originated H1N1 pandemic indicate that the main target is not the elderly population but, instead, younger adults (www.who.org [153, 180] ). The immunosenescence concept suggested that older people would be at greatest risk. The predominant involvement of younger individuals suggests a role for unknown factors that contribute to clinical disease. Alternatively, aging might exert a protective effect. However, it must be hoped that the current wave of H1N1 influenza is not a relatively harmless prelude to a second severe outbreak later in the flu season.As with any influenza variant, the H1N1 strain warrants close attention in high-risk patients. All influenza variants can cause severe pneumonia in patients with hematological malignancies."", ""Adenoviruses"": ""Adenoviruses are small naked DNA viruses that occur worldwide and mainly infect children between 0.5 and 5 years of age. The clinical spectrum ranges from mild to severe respiratory diseases to epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (\""pink eye\""), tonsillopharyngitis, and gastroenteric disorders (vomiting, diarrhea). Adenoviruses occur in over 50 serotypes, affecting all age groups and causing diseases that are usually self-limiting within 14 ""}",Emerging Viral Infections,"Emerging viral pathogens are a major cause of severe infections that constitute serious complications in patients with hematological disorders. During the last decade, a large number of viruses were discovered using optimized molecular techniques and systematic screening approaches. Most of the newly detected viruses affect the respiratory tract, causing common colds and also, especially in high-risk patients, life-threatening events. On the other hand, a substantial proportion of patients are reinfected by old viruses that were previously described only rarely or not at all in cancer patients. This chapter focuses on both emerging viruses and reemerging viral infections that affect patients with hematological malignancies.",10.1007/978-3-642-15742-4_22,PMC,PMC7123354,,no-cc,2010-08-19,Pulmonary Involvement in Patients with Hematological Malignancies,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123354/,2010.0,paper
